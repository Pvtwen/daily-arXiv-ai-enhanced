### [1] [Binary Hypothesis Testing-Based Low-Complexity Beamspace Channel Estimation for mmWave Massive MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01007)
*Hanyoung Park,Ji-Woong Choi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯二元假设检验和波束空间稀疏性的低复杂度信道去噪方法，适用于毫米波通信系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波通信因带宽大而受关注，但其信号存在路径损耗大、散射差等问题，需大天线阵列和定向波束成形。信道估计复杂度高，成为负担。

Method: 采用贝叶斯二元假设检验和波束空间稀疏性建模，通过似然比检验检测信号相关元素，并应用硬阈值规则抑制噪声。

Result: 尽管复杂度极低，该方法在信道估计精度上与复杂迭代或学习型方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于资源受限的毫米波系统，理论分析和数值评估支持其有效性。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications have gained attention as a key
technology for high-capacity wireless systems, owing to the wide available
bandwidth. However, mmWave signals suffer from their inherent characteristics
such as severe path loss, poor scattering, and limited diffraction, which
necessitate the use of large antenna arrays and directional beamforming,
typically implemented through massive MIMO architectures. Accurate channel
estimation is critical in such systems, but its computational complexity
increases proportionally with the number of antennas. This may become a
significant burden in mmWave systems where channels exhibit rapid fluctuations
and require frequent updates. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity
channel denoiser based on Bayesian binary hypothesis testing and beamspace
sparsity. By modeling each sparse beamspace component as a mixture of signal
and noise under a Bernoulli-complex Gaussian prior, we formulate a likelihood
ratio test to detect signal-relevant elements. Then, a hard-thresholding rule
is applied to suppress noise-dominant components in the noisy channel vector.
Despite its extremely low computational complexity, the proposed method
achieves channel estimation accuracy that is comparable to that of complex
iterative or learning-based approaches. This effectiveness is supported by both
theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation, suggesting that the method can
be a viable option for mmWave systems with strict resource constraints.

### [2] [Coordinated Decentralized Resource Optimization for Cell-Free ISAC Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01044)
*Mehdi Zafari,Rang Liu,A. Lee Swindlehurst*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种去中心化优化算法，用于无小区ISAC网络中的波束成形和功率分配，解决了传统集中式架构的可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G无线网络中，集成感知与通信（ISAC）需要更高效的资源优化方法，而现有集中式方案在分布式系统中难以扩展。

Method: 提出两种算法：1）固定波束成形与集中式功率分配结合；2）完全去中心化的共识ADMM框架联合优化波束成形和功率控制。

Result: 仿真结果表明，两种算法在减少前传开销和提升系统性能方面均表现出色，适用于去中心化无小区架构。

Conclusion: 去中心化算法为ISAC在分布式系统中的可扩展部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler for
6G wireless networks, allowing the joint use of spectrum and infrastructure for
both communication and sensing. While prior ISAC solutions have addressed
resource optimization, including power allocation, beamforming, and waveform
design, they often rely on centralized architectures with full network
knowledge, limiting their scalability in distributed systems. In this paper, we
propose two coordinated decentralized optimization algorithms for beamforming
and power allocation tailored to cell-free ISAC networks. The first algorithm
employs locally designed fixed beamformers at access points (APs), combined
with a centralized power allocation scheme computed at a central server (CS).
The second algorithm jointly optimizes beamforming and power control through a
fully decentralized consensus ADMM framework. Both approaches rely on local
information at APs and limited coordination with the CS. Simulation results
obtained using our proposed Python-based simulation framework evaluate their
fronthaul overhead and system-level performance, demonstrating their
practicality for scalable ISAC deployment in decentralized, cell-free
architectures.

computational complexity while maintaining near-optimal performance. Using
power-division non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) as an example, we
demonstrate how this approach mitigates the challenge of power allocation in
multi-cell networks. Our method reduces the search space for optimization,
significantly decreasing computational overhead while ensuring efficient
spectrum utilization. In principle, the method reduces the dimensions of search
space by half. Extensive analysis and simulations validate its effectiveness,
highlighting its potential for practical deployment in next-generation wireless
networks. The proposed framework can help streamline resource allocation in
complex communication environments, enhancing system performance and
scalability.

### [5] [On the Characterization and Evaluation of Doppler Squint in Wideband ODDM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01283)
*Xuehan Wang,Jinhong Yuan,Jintao Wang,Zhi Sun*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了正交延迟多普勒分复用（ODDM）调制中的宽频效应（多普勒偏斜效应，DSE），并分析了其对系统性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多忽略ODDM信号的宽频特性导致的交互色散，可能导致性能下降。

Method: 通过分析多径信道的时变频率响应，研究了DSE引起的额外延迟-多普勒（DD）色散，并推导了RCP和ZP宽频ODDM系统的特性。

Result: 理论分析表明DSE会导致额外的DD扩展和更复杂的功率泄漏，数值结果验证了DSE的重要性。

Conclusion: 本文的推导有助于开发基于ODDM的集成传感与通信系统中的精确信号处理技术。

Abstract: The recently proposed orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM)
modulation has been demonstrated to enjoy excellent reliability over
doubly-dispersive channels. However, most of the prior analysis tends to ignore
the interactive dispersion caused by the wideband property of ODDM signal,
which possibly leads to performance degradation. To solve this problem, we
investigate the input-output relation of ODDM systems considering the wideband
effect, which is also known as the Doppler squint effect (DSE) in the
literature. The extra delay-Doppler (DD) dispersion caused by the DSE is first
explicitly explained by employing the time-variant frequency response of
multipath channels. Its characterization is then derived for both reduced
cyclic prefix (RCP) and zero padded (ZP)-based wideband ODDM systems, where the
extra DD spread and more complicated power leakage outside the peak region are
presented theoretically. Numerical results are finally provided to confirm the
significance of DSE. The derivations in this paper are beneficial for
developing accurate signal processing techniques in ODDM-based integrated
sensing and communication systems.

Abstract: A fully customisable chip-on board (COB) LED design to evoke two brain
responses simultaneously (steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and
transient evoked potential, P300) is discussed in this paper. Considering
different possible modalities in braincomputer interfacing (BCI), SSVEP is
widely accepted as it requires a lesser number of electroencephalogram (EEG)
electrodes and minimal training time. The aim of this work was to produce a
hybrid BCI hardware platform to evoke SSVEP and P300 precisely with reduced
fatigue and improved classification performance. The system comprises of four
independent radial green visual stimuli controlled individually by a 32-bit
microcontroller platform to evoke SSVEP and four red LEDs flashing at random
intervals to generate P300 events. The system can also record the P300 event
timestamps that can be used in classification, to improve the accuracy and
reliability. The hybrid stimulus was tested for realtime classification
accuracy by controlling a LEGO robot to move in four directions.

### [7] [Balancing Latency and Model Accuracy for Fluid Antenna-Assisted LM-Embedded MIMO Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01689)

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的FA辅助LM嵌入网络在延迟和PSNR方面优于其他基准网络。

Conclusion: FA技术能有效降低网络延迟并保持模型精度，为LM嵌入网络提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of large model (LM)-embedded wireless
network for handling the trade-off problem of model accuracy and network
latency. To guarantee a high-quality of users' service, the network latency
should be minimized while maintaining an acceptable inference accuracy. To meet
this requirement, LM quantization is proposed to reduce the latency. However,
the excessive quantization may destroy the accuracy of LM inference. To this
end, a promising fluid antenna (FA) technology is investigated for enhancing
the transmission capacity, leading to a lower network latency in the
LM-embedded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network. To design the
FA-assisted LM-embedded network with the lower latency and higher accuracy
requirements, the latency and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) are considered
in the objective function. Then, an efficient optimization algorithm is
proposed under the block coordinate descent framework. Simulation results are
provided to show the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm, and the
performance gains from the proposed FA-assisted LMembedded network over the
other benchmark networks in terms of network latency and PSNR.

### [8] [Spectrum Sensing with Deep Clustering: Label-Free Radio Access Technology Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01709)
*Ljupcho Milosheski,Mihael Mohorčič,Carolina Fortuna*

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着设备数量增加和网络密集化，频谱资源需求激增，但现有基于监督学习的RAT分类方法依赖大量标记数据，泛化能力存疑。

Method: 提出了一种无需标记数据的频谱感知工作流，采用自监督学习（SSL）深度聚类架构，从原始FFT数据中自主提取特征。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上测试，模型性能提升35%，参数减少22%，计算量降低50%。

Conclusion: 该方法在无标记数据环境下表现优异，为未来6G频谱感知提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The growth of the number of connected devices and network densification is
driving an increasing demand for radio network resources, particularly Radio
Frequency (RF) spectrum. Given the dynamic and complex nature of contemporary
wireless environments, characterized by a wide variety of devices and multiple
RATs, spectrum sensing is envisioned to become a building component of future
6G, including as a component within O-RAN or digital twins. However, the
current SotA research for RAT classification predominantly revolves around
supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach that require
extensive labeled dataset. Due to this, it is unclear how existing models
behave in environments for which training data is unavailable thus leaving open
questions regarding their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we
propose a new spectrum sensing workflow in which the model training does not
require any prior knowledge of the RATs transmitting in that area (i.e. no
labelled data) and the class assignment can be easily done through manual
mapping. Furthermore, we adapt a SSL deep clustering architecture capable of
autonomously extracting spectrum features from raw 1D Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) data. We evaluate the proposed architecture on three real-world datasets
from three European cities, in the 868 MHz, 2.4 GHz and 5.9 GHz bands
containing over 10 RATs and show that the developed model achieves superior
performance by up to 35 percentage points with 22% fewer trainable parameters
and 50% less floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) compared to an SotA
AE-based reference architecture.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的无监督自动调制分类框架ModFus-DM，通过生成模型和特征融合模块解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的自动调制分类方法需要大量标注信号且难以应对信号长度不固定、分布偏移和标注数据有限的问题。

Method: 设计了调制信号扩散生成模型（MSDGM）和扩散感知特征融合模块（DAFFus），通过渐进去噪和多尺度特征融合提升分类性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在标注数据有限、分布偏移和变长信号识别等场景下表现出色，24类识别任务中在SNR≥12dB时准确率达88.27%。

Conclusion: ModFus-DM为自动调制分类提供了一种高效的无监督解决方案，适用于复杂无线通信场景。

Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is essential for wireless
communication systems in both military and civilian applications. However,
existing deep learning-based AMC methods often require large labeled signals
and struggle with non-fixed signal lengths, distribution shifts, and limited
labeled signals. To address these challenges, we propose a modulation-driven
feature fusion via diffusion model (ModFus-DM), a novel unsupervised AMC
framework that leverages the generative capacity of diffusion models for robust
modulation representation learning. We design a modulated signal diffusion
generation model (MSDGM) to implicitly capture structural and semantic
information through a progressive denoising process. Additionally, we propose
the diffusion-aware feature fusion (DAFFus) module, which adaptively aggregates
multi-scale diffusion features to enhance discriminative representation.
Extensive experiments on RML2016.10A, RML2016.10B, RML2018.01A and RML2022
datasets demonstrate that ModFus-DM significantly outperforms existing methods
in various challenging scenarios, such as limited-label settings, distribution
shifts, variable-length signal recognition and channel fading scenarios.
Notably, ModFus-DM achieves over 88.27% accuracy in 24-type recognition tasks
at SNR $\geq $ 12dB with only 10 labeled signals per type.

(FAS) technology onto the UAV. Our proposed approach leverages the dynamic port
switching capability of FAS, enabling the UAV to adaptively select the optimal
antenna location that maximizes channel gain for both downlink wireless power
transfer (WPT) and uplink wireless data transfer (WDT). We derive both exact
analytical expression of the ergodic spectral rate, and asymptotic expression
at high signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime under Nakagami-m correlated fading
channels. The Mont-Carlo simulation results confirms the accuracy of the
analytical expressions and demonstrate the substantial increase in energy
efficiency of UAV with FAS compared to fixed antenna systems.

### [11] [Statistical Multiport-Network Modeling and Efficient Discrete Optimization of RIS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01776)

Conclusion: 研究结果可推广到非对角RIS、堆叠智能超表面、动态超表面天线和波域物理神经网络等领域。

Abstract: This Letter fills the research gap on physics-consistent optimization for
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with mutual coupling (MC) and
1-bit-tunable elements, a common hardware constraint in existing RIS
prototypes. We compare a model-based method (temperature-annealed
back-propagation) and model-agnostic methods (coordinate descent, genetic
algorithm), and evaluate potential benefits of intelligently initializing these
methods. To facilitate our evaluation, we introduce a technique for generating
statistical ensembles of multiport-network model parameters, wherein a single
hyper-parameter adjusts the MC strength. The technique is a generalization of
Rayleigh fading to radio environments with deterministic programmability, and
it accounts for passivity constraints as well as the coherent-backscattering
effect. We find that, except when MC is negligible, coordinate descent with
random initialization yields the most favorable trade-off in terms of
performance, execution time and memory usage. We expect our findings to extend
to beyond-diagonal RIS, stacked intelligent metasurfaces, dynamic metasurface
antennas, and wave-domain physical neural networks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的RS-LS估计器，用于解决RIS辅助MIMO系统中的高维信道估计问题，特别考虑了互耦效应和近场传播环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RIS与大规模MIMO结合时，高维信道矩阵导致计算复杂性和导频开销增加，传统估计器难以应对互耦效应和近场传播的挑战。

Method: 改进的RS-LS估计器，明确纳入互耦效应，并适用于近场传播环境。

Result: 考虑互耦效应后，性能提升约5 dB（SNR为5 dB时）。

Conclusion: 改进的RS-LS估计器在复杂环境中显著提升了信道估计性能。

Abstract: The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with extremely
large multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays at the base station has
emerged as a key enabler for enhancing wireless network performance. However,
this setup introduces high-dimensional channel matrices, leading to increased
computational complexity and pilot overhead in channel estimation. Mutual
coupling (MC) effects among densely packed unit cells, spatial correlation, and
near-field propagation conditions further complicate the estimation process.
Conventional estimators, such as linear minimum mean square error (MMSE),
require channel statistics that are challenging to acquire for high-dimensional
arrays, while least squares (LS) estimators suffer from performance
limitations. To address these challenges, the reduced-subspace least squares
(RS-LS) estimator leverages array geometry to enhance estimation accuracy. This
work advances the promising RS-LS estimation algorithm by explicitly
incorporating MC effects into the more realistic and challenging near-field
propagation environment within the increasingly relevant generalized RIS-aided
MIMO framework. Additionally, we investigate the impact of MC on the spatial
degrees of freedom (DoF). Our analysis reveals that accounting for MC effects
provides a significant performance gain of approximately 5 dB at an SNR of 5
dB, compared to conventional methods that ignore MC.

Result: 实验表明，该方案显著提升联邦学习的稳定性和有效性，并数学推导了收敛速率验证性能改进。

Conclusion: FedSFR算法通过特征重构优化通信容量利用，提升图像传输质量和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Research in semantic communication has garnered considerable attention,
particularly in the area of image transmission, where joint source-channel
coding (JSCC)-based neural network (NN) modules are frequently employed.
However, these systems often experience performance degradation over time due
to an outdated knowledge base, highlighting the need for periodic updates. To
address this challenge in the context of training JSCC modules for image
transmission, we propose a federated learning (FL) algorithm with semantic
feature reconstruction (FR), named FedSFR. This algorithm more efficiently
utilizes the available communication capacity by allowing some of the selected
FL participants to transmit smaller feature vectors instead of local update
information. Unlike conventional FL methods, our approach integrates FR at the
parameter server (PS), stabilizing training and enhancing image transmission
quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme
significantly enhances both the stability and effectiveness of the FL process
compared to other algorithms. Furthermore, we mathematically derive the
convergence rate to validate the improved performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC系统在实际应用中面临硬件损伤、多径传播和非线性分布等挑战，传统理论性能指标难以解析推导。基于分数的生成模型为解决这些问题提供了新思路。

Conclusion: 基于分数的生成模型在ISAC性能分析、算法设计和系统优化中展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a key enabler for
next-generation wireless systems, aiming to support both high-throughput
communication and high-accuracy environmental sensing using shared spectrum and
hardware. Theoretical performance metrics, such as mutual information (MI),
minimum mean squared error (MMSE), and Bayesian Cram\'{e}r--Rao bound (BCRB),
play a key role in evaluating ISAC system performance limits. However, in
practice, hardware impairments, multipath propagation, interference, and scene
constraints often result in nonlinear, multimodal, and non-Gaussian
distributions, making it challenging to derive these metrics analytically.
Recently, there has been a growing interest in applying score-based generative
models to characterize these metrics from data, although not discussed for
ISAC. This paper provides a tutorial-style summary of recent advances in
score-based performance evaluation, with a focus on ISAC systems. We refer to
the summarized framework as scoring ISAC, which not only reflects the core
methodology based on score functions but also emphasizes the goal of scoring
(i.e., evaluating) ISAC systems under realistic conditions. We present the
connections between classical performance metrics and the score functions and
provide the practical training techniques for learning score functions to
estimate performance metrics. Proof-of-concept experiments on target detection
and localization validate the accuracy of score-based performance estimators
against ground-truth analytical expressions, illustrating their ability to
replicate and extend traditional analyses in more complex, realistic settings.
This framework demonstrates the great potential of score-based generative
models in ISAC performance analysis, algorithm design, and system optimization.

Abstract: Contactless cardiac monitoring has vast potential to replace contact-based
monitoring in various future scenarios such as smart home and in-cabin
monitoring. Various contactless sensors can be potentially implemented for
cardiac monitoring, such as cameras, acoustic sensors, Wi-Fi routers and
radars. Among all these sensors, radar could achieve unobtrusive monitoring
with high accuracy and robustness at the same time. The research about
radar-based cardiac monitoring can be generally divided into the radar
architecture design and signal-processing parts, where the former has been
thoroughly reviewed in the literature but not the latter. To the best of the
author knowledge, this is the first review paper that focuses on elaborating
the algorithms for extracting cardiac features from the received radar signal.
In addition, a new taxonomy is proposed to reveal the core feature of each
algorithm, with the pros and cons evaluated in detail. Furthermore, the public
datasets containing the received radar signal and ground-truth cardiac feature
signal are listed with detailed configurations, and the corresponding
evaluations may help the researchers select the suitable dataset. At last,
several unsolved challenges and future directions are suggested and discussed
in detail to encourage future research on solving the main obstacles in this
field. In summary, this review can be served as a guide for researchers and
practitioners to quickly understand the research trend and recent development
of the cardiac feature extraction algorithms, and it is worth further
investigating the relative area based on the proposed challenges and future
directions.

Abstract: Broad beam beamforming (BF) design in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
can be convenient for initial access, synchronization, and sensing capabilities
in cellular networks by avoiding overheads of sweeping methods while making
efficient use of resources. Phase-only BF is key for maximizing power
efficiency across antennas. A successful method to produce broad beams is the
phase-only dual-polarization BF (DPBF). However, its efficiency has not been
proved in non-line-of-sight (NLoS). Therefore, this paper contributes by
evaluating DPBF in collocated and distributed MIMO configurations under both
line-of-sight (LoS) and NLoS channel conditions. We model the reflection
coefficients for different materials in NLoS conditions and propose the use of
orthogonal space-time block code to improve the coverage compared to the DPBF
in collocated MIMO (C-MIMO). We further propose a DPBF method for distributed
MIMO and show that it achieves better coverage than C-MIMO with DPBF.

Result: 数值结果表明，ECME算法收敛更快且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: ECME算法在方向到达估计中优于FAAN方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Maximum likelihood factor analysis has been used for direction of arrival
estimation in unknown nonuniform noise and some iterative approaches have been
developed. In particular, the Factor Analysis for Anisotropic Noise (FAAN)
method proposed by Stoica and Babu has excellent convergence properties. In
this letter, the Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either (ECME) algorithm,
an extension of the expectation-maximization algorithm, is designed, which has
almost the same computational complexity at each iteration as the FAAN method.
However, numerical results show that the ECME algorithm yields faster stable
convergence and is computationally more efficient.

TL;DR: APS-ISAC是一种新型的导频设计方法，通过重叠块导频结构和用户特定的相位偏移，解决了传统导频分配在频谱效率和感知性能之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在OFDMA框架中，传统导频分配方法在频谱效率和感知性能之间存在矛盾，需要一种更高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Method: 提出自适应相位偏移ISAC（APS-ISAC），采用重叠块导频结构和用户特定相位偏移，以优化资源利用和信道响应分离。

Result: APS-ISAC显著提高了频谱效率，支持更多用户复用，同时降低了均方误差，并实现了高分辨率和无模糊的感知性能。

Conclusion: APS-ISAC为未来上行ISAC系统提供了一种可扩展、高效、低复杂度的导频设计范例。

Abstract: In uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, pilot signal
design is crucial for enabling accurate channel estimation and reliable radar
sensing. In orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based
frameworks, conventional pilot allocation schemes face a trade-off between
spectral efficiency (SE) and sensing performance. Interleaved pilots improve
user equipment (UE) multiplexing through sparse allocation but reduce the
maximum unambiguous range. Conversely, orthogonal block-based pilots reduce
range ambiguity but degrade sensing resolution due to limited delay
granularity. To address this trade-off, the phase-shifted ISAC (PS-ISAC) scheme
was recently proposed for uplink multiple access in ISAC systems. However,
PS-ISAC suffers from spectral inefficiency due to the fixed cyclic prefix (CP)
constraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose adaptive
phase-shifted-ISAC (APS-ISAC), an enhanced pilot scheme that employs an
overlapped block-pilot structure with UE-specific phase shifts determined by
maximum excess delay of each UE. This design enables UEs to share the same
time-frequency resources while preserving separable and contiguous channel
impulse responses (CIRs) at the base station (BS). Simulation results show that
APS-ISAC significantly outperforms conventional pilot allocation methods in
terms of SE, approximately doubling the number of multiplexed UEs. It also
achieves lower mean square error (MSE) under power constraints with reduced
complexity. Furthermore, it yields maximum range resolution and unambiguous
sensing performance. These results establish APS-ISAC as a scalable, spectrally
efficient, ambiguity-resilient, and low-complexity pilot design paradigm for
future uplink ISAC systems.

Motivation: 监测马匹的呼吸参数（如呼吸率）有助于了解训练对马匹健康和表现的影响，从而改善马匹福利。

Method: 研究比较了基于深度学习的方法（时间卷积网络和长短时记忆网络）与信号处理方法，用于从麦克风录音中检测呼吸事件和提取动态呼吸率。

Result: 时间卷积网络在检测呼气声音和估计动态呼吸率方面表现最佳（F1分数中位数0.94，MAE±CI：1.44±1.04 bpm），优于长短时记忆网络和信号处理方法。

Conclusion: 该研究首次实现了自动检测马匹呼吸声音和计算动态呼吸率，未来将进一步验证模型在低强度运动和不同麦克风放置下的表现。

Abstract: Monitoring respiration parameters such as respiratory rate could be
beneficial to understand the impact of training on equine health and
performance and ultimately improve equine welfare. In this work, we compare
deep learning-based methods to an adapted signal processing method to
automatically detect cyclic respiratory events and extract the dynamic
respiratory rate from microphone recordings during high intensity exercise in
Standardbred trotters. Our deep learning models are able to detect exhalation
sounds (median F1 score of 0.94) in noisy microphone signals and show promising
results on unlabelled signals at lower exercising intensity, where the
exhalation sounds are less recognisable. Temporal convolutional networks were
better at detecting exhalation events and estimating dynamic respiratory rates
(median F1: 0.94, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) $\pm$ Confidence Intervals (CI):
1.44$\pm$1.04 bpm, Limits Of Agreements (LOA): 0.63$\pm$7.06 bpm) than long
short-term memory networks (median F1: 0.90, MAE$\pm$CI: 3.11$\pm$1.58 bpm) and
signal processing methods (MAE$\pm$CI: 2.36$\pm$1.11 bpm). This work is the
first to automatically detect equine respiratory sounds and automatically
compute dynamic respiratory rates in exercising horses. In the future, our
models will be validated on lower exercising intensity sounds and different
microphone placements will be evaluated in order to find the best combination
for regular monitoring.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究探讨了高占空比视觉刺激对减少视觉疲劳和提高SSVEP性能的影响，发现85%占空比效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSVEP在视觉诊断和脑机接口中应用广泛，但传统闪烁刺激易导致视觉疲劳且精度不足，需寻找解决方案。

Method: 使用定制LED硬件生成50%至95%占空比的PWM刺激，记录脑电图数据并测试10名受试者的反应。

Result: 高占空比（85%）显著减少视觉疲劳，且SSVEP响应性能达到峰值。

Conclusion: 85%占空比的视觉刺激可提升SSVEP的实用性和用户体验。

Abstract: Steady state visual evoked response (SSVEP) is widely used in visual-based
diagnosis and applications such as brain computer interfacing due to its high
information transfer rate and the capability to activate commands through
simple gaze control. However, one major impediment in using flashing visual
stimulus to obtain SSVEP is eye fatigue that prevents continued long term use
preventing practical deployment. This combined with the difficulty in
establishing precise pulse-width modulation (PWM) that results in poorer
accuracy warrants the development of appropriate approach to solve these
issues. Various studies have suggested the usage of high frequencies of visual
stimulus to reduce the visual fatigue for the user but this results in poor
response performance. Here, the authors study the use of extremely high
duty-cycles in the stimulus in the hope of solving these constraints.
Electroencephalogram data was recorded with PWM duty-cycles of 50 to 95%
generated by a precise custom-made light-emitting diode hardware and tested ten
subjects responded that increasing duty-cycles had less visual strain for all
the frequency values and the SSVEP exhibited a subject-independent peak
response for duty-cycle of 85%. This could pave the way for increased usage of
SSVEP for practical applications.

Abstract: The reliability of affective state estimation using EEG data is in question,
given the variability in reported performance and the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols. To investigate this, we reviewed 101 studies, focusing on
the widely used DEAP dataset for emotion recognition. Our analysis revealed
widespread methodological issues that include data leakage from improper
segmentation, biased feature selection, flawed hyperparameter optimization,
neglect of class imbalance, and insufficient methodological reporting. Notably,
we found that nearly 87% of the reviewed papers contained one or more of these
errors. Moreover, through experimental analysis, we observed that such
methodological flaws can inflate the classification accuracy by up to 46%.
These findings reveal fundamental gaps in standardized evaluation practices and
highlight critical deficiencies in the peer review process for machine learning
applications in neuroscience, emphasizing the urgent need for stricter
methodological standards and evaluation protocols.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化源端发射功率和目的端干扰功率的方法，以最大化无线网络在有限时间内的平均保密能量效率（SEE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过利用目的端的全双工能力发送干扰信号来提升保密性，同时源端和目的端均具有能量收集能力但电池容量有限。

Method: 将问题建模为有限时域强化学习（RL）问题，提出了FHJPA算法，并与低复杂度贪婪算法（GA）和无限时域算法（IHJPA）进行比较。

Result: FHJPA算法在SEE和计算复杂度上优于GA和IHJPA算法，尤其在有限时域传输中表现更优。GA在源端电池能量充足时接近FHJPA性能。

Conclusion: FHJPA算法在有限时域传输中具有显著优势，而IHJPA在时域延长时性能差距减小。

Abstract: In this paper, a joint optimal allocation of transmit power at the source and
jamming power at the destination is proposed to maximize the average secrecy
energy efficiency (SEE) of a wireless network within a finite time duration.
The destination transmits the jamming signal to improve secrecy by utilizing
full-duplex capability. The source and destination both have energy harvesting
(EH) capability with limited battery capacity. Due to the Markov nature of the
system, the problem is formulated as a finite-horizon reinforcement learning
(RL) problem. We propose the finite-horizon joint power allocation (FHJPA)
algorithm for the finite-horizon RL problem and compare it with a
low-complexity greedy algorithm (GA). An infinite-horizon joint power
allocation (IHJPA) algorithm is also proposed for the corresponding
infinite-horizon problem. A comparative analysis of these algorithms is carried
out in terms of SEE, expected total transmitted secure bits, and computational
complexity. The results show that the FHJPA algorithm outperforms the GA and
IHJPA algorithms due to its appropriate modelling in finite horizon
transmission. When the source node battery has sufficient energy, the GA can
yield performance close to the FHJPA algorithm despite its low-complexity. When
the transmission time horizon increases, the accuracy of the infinite-horizon
model improves, resulting in a reduced performance gap between FHJPA and IHJPA
algorithms. The computational time comparison shows that the FHJPA algorithm
takes $16.6$ percent less time than the IHJPA algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有压缩感知方法在多音高估计中存在的相干性问题和谐波失真现象。

Method: 通过最优传输理论正则化，将信号的频谱内容分配到少量谐波系列中，并提出了针对随机和确定性信号的两种估计方法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上的实验表明，该方法优于传统统计信号处理方法，与基于网络的方法性能相当或更好。

Conclusion: 该方法在多音高估计中表现出色，尤其在处理噪声和谐波失真时具有优势。

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of multi-pitch estimation, i.e.,
identifying super-imposed truncated harmonic series from noisy measurements. We
phrase this as recovering a harmonically-structured measure on the unit circle,
where the structure is enforced using regularizers based on optimal transport
theory. In the resulting framework, a signal's spectral content is
simultaneously inferred and assigned, or transported, to a small set of
harmonic series defined by their corresponding fundamental frequencies. In
contrast to existing methods from the compressed sensing paradigm, the proposed
framework decouples regularization and dictionary design and mitigates
coherency problems. As a direct consequence, this also introduces robustness to
the phenomenon of inharmonicity. From this framework, we derive two estimation
methods, one for stochastic and one for deterministic signals, and propose
efficient numerical algorithms implementing them. In numerical studies on both
synthetic and real data, the proposed methods are shown to achieve better
estimation performance as compared to other methods from statistical signal
processing literature. Furthermore, they perform comparably or better than
network-based methods, except when the latter are specially trained on the
data-type considered and are given access to considerably more data during
inference.

Motivation: 探索DPE在OFDM定位系统中的理论极限和性能，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 推导DPE的CRB，并与两步定位法在NLOS多径环境中进行性能对比。

Result: 1) DPE在所有条件下均优于两步法；2) 大带宽和增加子载波间距对性能至关重要；3) 使用多个OFDM符号可显著提高定位精度，但进一步增加符号数量带来的改进有限且计算复杂度高。

Conclusion: DPE在OFDM系统中具有显著优势，但需权衡符号数量和计算复杂度。

Abstract: Although direct position estimation (DPE) has been demonstrated to offer
enhanced robustness in GNSS receivers, its theoretical limits and performance
in OFDM based positioning systems remain largely unexplored. In this paper, the
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for DPE using OFDM based cellular signals is derived
and benchmarked against the conventional two-step positioning method to assess
their relative performance in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) dominated multipath
environments. Numerical results reveal that 1) the DPE method consistently
outperforms the two-step approach in OFDM systems under all evaluated
conditions; 2) a large bandwidth is crucial in both methods, and increasing
subcarrier spacing is more beneficial for a fixed bandwidth; 3) utilizing
multiple OFDM symbols for positioning leads to substantial improvements in
localization accuracy compared to relying on a single symbol. However, further
increasing the number of symbols yields marginal improvements while
significantly increasing computational complexity.

Conclusion: PCS框架为数据科学提供了一种原则性方法，能够有效应对不确定性，提升结果的可信度。

Abstract: Data science is a pillar of artificial intelligence (AI), which is
transforming nearly every domain of human activity, from the social and
physical sciences to engineering and medicine. While data-driven findings in AI
offer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many
are difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is
the uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science
life cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for
this uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework
for veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to
addressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated
and streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with
guided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS
framework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the
uncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data
cleaning stage.

Conclusion: 该方法填补了深度学习与物理驱动建模之间的空白，为多尺度和时间依赖PDE系统提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are pivotal in modeling
complex physical systems, yet traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) often struggle with unresolved residuals in critical spatiotemporal
regions and violations of temporal causality. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel Residual Guided Training strategy for Physics-Informed
Transformer via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our framework integrates
a decoder-only Transformer to inherently capture temporal correlations through
autoregressive processing, coupled with a residual-aware GAN that dynamically
identifies and prioritizes high-residual regions. By introducing a causal
penalty term and an adaptive sampling mechanism, the method enforces temporal
causality while refining accuracy in problematic domains. Extensive numerical
experiments on the Allen-Cahn, Klein-Gordon, and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate significant improvements, achieving relative MSE reductions of up
to three orders of magnitude compared to baseline methods. This work bridges
the gap between deep learning and physics-driven modeling, offering a robust
solution for multiscale and time-dependent PDE systems.

Abstract: The increasing availability of geospatial foundation models has the potential
to transform remote sensing applications such as land cover classification,
environmental monitoring, and change detection. Despite promising benchmark
results, the deployment of these models in operational settings is challenging
and rare. Standardized evaluation tasks often fail to capture real-world
complexities relevant for end-user adoption such as data heterogeneity,
resource constraints, and application-specific requirements. This paper
presents a structured approach to integrate geospatial foundation models into
operational mapping systems. Our protocol has three key steps: defining
application requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data and
conducting rigorous empirical testing. Using the Presto model in a case study
for crop mapping, we demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained model
significantly improves performance over conventional supervised methods. Our
results highlight the model's strong spatial and temporal generalization
capabilities. Our protocol provides a replicable blueprint for practitioners
and lays the groundwork for future research to operationalize foundation models
in diverse remote sensing applications. Application of the protocol to the
WorldCereal global crop-mapping system showcases the framework's scalability.

Conclusion: 刚性神经网络ODE的训练和参数识别面临根本性限制，梯度消失现象是A稳定和L稳定积分方案的普遍特征。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other
parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to
differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff
systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling
fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to
optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient
phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature
of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze
the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and
demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the
derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness.
Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which
illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the
slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is
$O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping
methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a
significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural
ODEs.

Abstract: In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict the
axial load-bearing capacity, (kN), of cold-formed steel structural members. The
methodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing
the limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the
nonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The
dataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns,
was curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of
non-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive
suite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based
regressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient
Boosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple
metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared
error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as
the final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and
interaction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To
facilitate practical deployment, the model was integrated into an interactive,
Python-based web interface via Streamlit. This tool allows end-users-such as
structural engineers and designers, to input design parameters manually or
through CSV upload, and to obtain real-time predictions of axial load capacity
without the need for programming expertise. Applied to the context of steel
storage rack columns, the framework demonstrates how data-driven tools can
enhance design safety, streamline validation workflows, and inform
decision-making in structural applications where buckling is a critical failure

Abstract: Satellite connectivity is gaining increased attention as the demand for
seamless internet access, especially in transportation and remote areas,
continues to grow. For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or
trains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent
presence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable
connectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite
beams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address
challenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can
analyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific
locations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before
connectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of
communication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over
multiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model
achieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of
machine learning in predicting signal quality during flight. By enabling
seamless broadband service, including roaming between different satellite
constellations and providers, our model addresses the need for real-time
predictions of signal quality. This approach can further be adapted to automate
satellite and beam-switching mechanisms to improve overall communication
efficiency. The model can also be retrained and applied to any moving object
with satellite connectivity, using customized datasets, including connected
vehicles and trains.

Motivation: 传统基于模型的诊断方法复杂且计算成本高，限制了实际应用。

Result: 模型在多种故障检测中表现优异，准确率超过90%。

Conclusion: GNN框架提供了一种轻量且高效的诊断方案，适用于实际工业应用。

Abstract: The diagnosis of induction machines has traditionally relied on model-based
methods that require the development of complex dynamic models, making them
difficult to implement and computationally expensive. To overcome these
limitations, this paper proposes a model-free approach using Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. The focus is on
detecting multiple fault types -- including eccentricity, bearing defects, and
broken rotor bars -- under varying severity levels and load conditions. Unlike
traditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct
inputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature
extraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts
relevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture
complex relationships between signal types and fault patterns. It is evaluated
for both individual fault detection and multi-class classification of combined
fault conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, achieving 92.5\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\% for
bearing faults, and 93.1\% for broken rotor bar detection. These findings
highlight the model's robustness and generalization capability across different
operational scenarios. The proposed GNN-based framework offers a lightweight
yet powerful solution that simplifies implementation while maintaining high
diagnostic performance. It stands as a promising alternative to conventional
model-based diagnostic techniques for real-world induction machine monitoring
and predictive maintenance.

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, enabling independent
verification and validation of empirical findings. The topic gained prominence
in fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non -
replicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In
recent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part
of this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and
reliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other
fields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In
addition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism
and computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly
recognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about
how these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to
closing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of
ML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly
all articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key
dimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the
dataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers
share a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the
publications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no
significant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to
publications with industry-affiliated authors. These findings highlight the
need for targeted interventions, including reproducibility guidelines, training
for researchers, and policies by journals and conferences that promote
transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing have many coherent
definitions of hallucination and methods for its detection and mitigation.
However, analogous definitions and methods do not exist for multi-variate
time-series (MVTS) foundation models. We propose new definitions for MVTS
hallucination, along with new detection and mitigation methods using a
diffusion model to estimate hallucination levels. We derive relational datasets
from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination
levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source
pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on
average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method
reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models. The definition and methods may
improve adoption and safe usage of MVTS foundation models.

Abstract: Time-evolving traffic flow forecasting are playing a vital role in
intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. However, the dynamic
traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex
temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great
contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic
networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are
prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder
the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this
issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph
learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns
obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from
the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection
techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden
global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the
relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment
results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method
and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various
real-world traffic networks.

Conclusion: FRA框架和SDSN算法有效解决了现有松弛方法的误差问题，同时通过混合精度架构实现了高性能和速度。

Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP),
seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the
NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations
that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However,
these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources
of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the
relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel
relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a
Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable
regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation
enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance
without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling
Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable
computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision
architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based
benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods
under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based
mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its
CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

Abstract: Naturalistic driving studies offer a powerful means for observing and
quantifying real-world driving behaviour. One of their prominent applications
in traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky
driving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows
and static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -
limiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world
driving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for
identifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.
The approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to
dynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing
subtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and
harsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random
Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong
capability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly
excelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk
detection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across
different thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more
variability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which
may be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway
emerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh
driving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual
variation. Overall, the findings support the value of adaptive, personalised
risk detection approaches for enhancing real-time safety feedback and tailoring
driver support in intelligent transport systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为高效数值积分提供了新思路，尤其适用于非奇异相互作用核和库仑相互作用核的情况。

Abstract: Gibbs measures, such as Coulomb gases, are popular in modelling systems of
interacting particles. Recently, we proposed to use Gibbs measures as
randomized numerical integration algorithms with respect to a target measure
$\pi$ on $\mathbb R^d$, following the heuristics that repulsiveness between
particles should help reduce integration errors. A major issue in this approach
is to tune the interaction kernel and confining potential of the Gibbs measure,
so that the equilibrium measure of the system is the target distribution $\pi$.
Doing so usually requires another Monte Carlo approximation of the
\emph{potential}, i.e. the integral of the interaction kernel with respect to
$\pi$. Using the methodology of large deviations from Garcia--Zelada (2019), we
show that a random approximation of the potential preserves the fast large
deviation principle that guarantees the proposed integration algorithm to
outperform independent or Markov quadratures. For non-singular interaction
kernels, we make minimal assumptions on this random approximation, which can be
the result of a computationally cheap Monte Carlo preprocessing. For the
Coulomb interaction kernel, we need the approximation to be based on another
Gibbs measure, and we prove in passing a control on the uniform convergence of
the approximation of the potential.

Conclusion: 通过优化潜在边距可构建更鲁棒的检测器。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in splicing detection, deep learning-based forensic
tools remain difficult to deploy in practice due to their high sensitivity to
training conditions. Even mild post-processing applied to evaluation images can
significantly degrade detector performance, raising concerns about their
reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we show that the same deep
architecture can react very differently to unseen post-processing depending on
the learned weights, despite achieving similar accuracy on in-distribution test
data. This variability stems from differences in the latent spaces induced by
training, which affect how samples are separated internally. Our experiments
reveal a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a
detector's ability to generalize to post-processed images. Based on this
observation, we propose a practical strategy for building more robust
detectors: train several variants of the same model under different conditions,
and select the one that maximizes latent margins.

Conclusion: DAM在高阶特征交互中表现受限，研究为理论到实践的桥梁，可能启发更多数据驱动方法。

Abstract: We investigate how feature correlations influence the capacity of Dense
Associative Memory (DAM), a Transformer attention-like model. Practical machine
learning scenarios involve feature-correlated data and learn representations in
the input space, but current capacity analyses do not account for this. We
develop an empirical framework to analyze the effects of data structure on
capacity dynamics. Specifically, we systematically construct datasets that vary
in feature correlation and pattern separation using Hamming distance from
information theory, and compute the model's corresponding storage capacity
using a simple binary search algorithm. Our experiments confirm that memory
capacity scales exponentially with increasing separation in the input space.
Feature correlations do not alter this relationship fundamentally, but reduce
capacity slightly at constant separation. This effect is amplified at higher
polynomial degrees in the energy function, suggesting that Associative Memory
is more limited in depicting higher-order interactions between features than
patterns. Our findings bridge theoretical work and practical settings for DAM,
and might inspire more data-centric methods.

Abstract: Modern large language models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet how
transformers acquire (store) knowledge during pre-training and extract
(retrieve) it during post-fine-tuning inference remains theoretically opaque.
While prior theoretical work has begun to investigate these questions through
the analysis of training dynamics, such studies are limited to single-layer,
attention-only architectures. However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs
are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based
language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such
simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction
objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer
framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By
tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization
guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction.
We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during
pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large
fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers
can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned
during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating
successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied,
transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our
analysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning. Furthermore,
our analysis offers theoretical insights into several pertinent empirical
phenomena, such as the role of learning rate schedules. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world PopQA datasets with GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B validate
our results.

Abstract: Score matching enables the estimation of the gradient of a data distribution,
a key component in denoising diffusion models used to recover clean data from
corrupted inputs. In prior work, a heuristic weighting function has been used
for the denoising score matching loss without formal justification. In this
work, we demonstrate that heteroskedasticity is an inherent property of the
denoising score matching objective. This insight leads to a principled
derivation of optimal weighting functions for generalized, arbitrary-order
denoising score matching losses, without requiring assumptions about the noise
distribution. Among these, the first-order formulation is especially relevant
to diffusion models. We show that the widely used heuristical weighting
function arises as a first-order Taylor approximation to the trace of the
expected optimal weighting. We further provide theoretical and empirical
comparisons, revealing that the heuristical weighting, despite its simplicity,
can achieve lower variance than the optimal weighting with respect to parameter
gradients, which can facilitate more stable and efficient training.

significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions,

persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training
checkpoints, particularly in deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and
universal representational structures emerge during neural network training.

Conclusion: GKB-UCB算法在广义核化赌博机中提供了统一的视角，并达到了最优的遗憾界。

Abstract: We study the regret minimization problem in the novel setting of generalized
kernelized bandits (GKBs), where we optimize an unknown function $f^*$
belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) having access to samples
generated by an exponential family (EF) noise model whose mean is a non-linear
function $\mu(f^*)$. This model extends both kernelized bandits (KBs) and
generalized linear bandits (GLBs). We propose an optimistic algorithm, GKB-UCB,
and we explain why existing self-normalized concentration inequalities do not
allow to provide tight regret guarantees. For this reason, we devise a novel
self-normalized Bernstein-like dimension-free inequality resorting to
Freedman's inequality and a stitching argument, which represents a contribution
of independent interest. Based on it, we conduct a regret analysis of GKB-UCB,
deriving a regret bound of order $\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$,
being $T$ the learning horizon, ${\gamma}_T$ the maximal information gain, and
$\kappa_*$ a term characterizing the magnitude the reward nonlinearity. Our
result matches, up to multiplicative constants and logarithmic terms, the
state-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs and provides a unified view of
both settings.

Conclusion: NeuCoReClass AD通过多任务自监督学习有效提升了时间序列异常检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a critical role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Among unsupervised approaches, self-supervised
learning has gained traction for modeling normal behavior without the need of
labeled data. However, many existing methods rely on a single proxy task,
limiting their ability to capture meaningful patterns in normal data. Moreover,
they often depend on handcrafted transformations tailored specific domains,
hindering their generalization accross diverse problems. To address these
limitations, we introduce NeuCoReClass AD, a self-supervised multi-task time
series anomaly detection framework that combines contrastive, reconstruction,
and classification proxy tasks. Our method employs neural transformation
learning to generate augmented views that are informative, diverse, and
coherent, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate NeuCoReClass
AD across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating that it consistently
outperforms both classical baselines and most deep-learning alternatives.
Furthermore, it enables the characterization of distinct anomaly profiles in a
fully unsupervised manner.

Result: TD2C在复杂非线性系统中表现优异，优于现有方法，特别是在高维和非线性场景下。

Conclusion: TD2C为复杂系统中的因果发现提供了鲁棒且可扩展的新工具。

Abstract: Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a
fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by
relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests
that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics.
This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to
pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and
learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal
graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce
Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that
operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal
signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical
descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time
series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen
dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C
achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established
methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing
the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for
uncovering causal structures in complex systems.

TL;DR: PALACE框架通过预测隐藏的推理令牌数量，解决了商业LLM服务中令牌审计的难题，提高了透明度和用户信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业LLM服务隐藏内部推理过程，可能导致令牌膨胀和超额计费，亟需可靠的令牌审计方法。

Method: PALACE框架通过GRPO增强的适配模块和轻量级领域路由器，动态校准不同推理任务的令牌使用模式。

Result: 在数学、编程、医学和通用推理基准测试中，PALACE表现出低相对误差和高预测准确性。

Conclusion: PALACE为标准化预测审计迈出重要一步，提升了透明度和用户信任。

Abstract: Commercial LLM services often conceal internal reasoning traces while still
charging users for every generated token, including those from hidden
intermediate steps, raising concerns of token inflation and potential
overbilling. This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing,
yet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g.,
hash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire
execution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent
variance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and
prompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of
LLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that
estimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access
to internal traces. PALACE introduces a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a
lightweight domain router, enabling dynamic calibration across diverse
reasoning tasks and mitigating variance in token usage patterns. Experiments on
math, coding, medical, and general reasoning benchmarks show that PALACE
achieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy, supporting both
fine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection. Taken together, PALACE
represents an important first step toward standardized predictive auditing,
offering a practical path to greater transparency, accountability, and user
trust.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上广泛评估，表现优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了特征获取的性能。

Abstract: Active Feature Acquisition is an instance-wise, sequential decision making
problem. The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on
current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches
either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or
greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and
unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised
manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many
possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive
evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that
our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.

Abstract: Using diffusion priors to solve inverse problems in imaging have
significantly matured over the years. In this chapter, we review the various

approaches into the more classic explicit approximation approaches and others,
which include variational inference, sequential monte carlo, and decoupled data
consistency. We cover the extension to more challenging situations, including
blind cases, high-dimensional data, and problems under data scarcity and
distribution mismatch. More recent approaches that aim to leverage multimodal
information through texts are covered. Through this chapter, we aim to (i)
distill the common mathematical threads that connect these algorithms, (ii)
systematically contrast their assumptions and performance trade-offs across
representative inverse problems, and (iii) spotlight the open theoretical and
practical challenges by clarifying the landscape of diffusion model based
inverse problem solvers.

Method: CaliMatch通过自适应标签平滑和温度缩放校准分类器和OOD检测器，无需手动调整平滑度。

Result: 在多个数据集（如CIFAR-10、ImageNet等）上，CaliMatch优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CaliMatch通过校准分类器和OOD检测器，显著提升了安全半监督学习的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data to improve the performance
of machine learning models when labeled data is scarce. However, its real-world
applications often face the label distribution mismatch problem, in which the
unlabeled dataset includes instances whose ground-truth labels are absent from
the labeled training dataset. Recent studies, referred to as safe SSL, have
addressed this issue by using both classification and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. However, the existing methods may suffer from overconfidence in deep
neural networks, leading to increased SSL errors because of high confidence in
incorrect pseudo-labels or OOD detection. To address this, we propose a novel
method, CaliMatch, which calibrates both the classifier and the OOD detector to
foster safe SSL. CaliMatch presents adaptive label smoothing and temperature
scaling, which eliminates the need to manually tune the smoothing degree for
effective calibration. We give a theoretical justification for why improving
the calibration of both the classifier and the OOD detector is crucial in safe
SSL. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet demonstrate that CaliMatch outperforms the existing methods in safe
SSL tasks.

Method: 提出了一个模型回收框架，通过识别相关源模型的子集进行高效参数训练，适用于白盒和黑盒设置。

Result: 该框架使模型即服务（MaaS）提供商能够构建高效的预训练模型库，支持多源无监督迁移学习。

Conclusion: 该研究为无源数据迁移学习提供了实用解决方案，扩展了迁移学习的应用场景。

Abstract: Increasing concerns for data privacy and other difficulties associated with
retrieving source data for model training have created the need for source-free
transfer learning, in which one only has access to pre-trained models instead
of data from the original source domains. This setting introduces many
challenges, as many existing transfer learning methods typically rely on access
to source data, which limits their direct applicability to scenarios where
source data is unavailable. Further, practical concerns make it more difficult,
for instance efficiently selecting models for transfer without information on
source data, and transferring without full access to the source models. So
motivated, we propose a model recycling framework for parameter-efficient
training of models that identifies subsets of related source models to reuse in
both white-box and black-box settings. Consequently, our framework makes it
possible for Model as a Service (MaaS) providers to build libraries of
efficient pre-trained models, thus creating an opportunity for multi-source
data-free supervised transfer learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLMs在临床实践中的安全性和可靠性，防止患者伤害并促进AI在医疗中的可信应用。

Method: 采用DAS框架，通过对抗性代理动态生成测试用例、识别不安全触发策略并实时评估响应，无需人工干预。

Result: 测试15个LLMs发现，静态基准表现与对抗压力下的脆弱性存在显著差异，多个安全领域（如鲁棒性、隐私、偏见/公平性、幻觉）失败率极高。

Conclusion: DAS框架为医疗AI提供了可进化、可扩展且可靠的安全保障，适用于医院、监管机构和技术供应商。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) in
clinical practice is critical to prevent patient harm and promote trustworthy
healthcare applications of AI. However, LLMs are advancing so rapidly that
static safety benchmarks often become obsolete upon publication, yielding only
an incomplete and sometimes misleading picture of model trustworthiness. We
demonstrate that a Dynamic, Automatic, and Systematic (DAS) red-teaming
framework that continuously stress-tests LLMs can reveal significant weaknesses
of current LLMs across four safety-critical domains: robustness, privacy,
bias/fairness, and hallucination. A suite of adversarial agents is applied to
autonomously mutate test cases, identify/evolve unsafe-triggering strategies,
and evaluate responses, uncovering vulnerabilities in real time without human
intervention. Applying DAS to 15 proprietary and open-source LLMs revealed a
stark contrast between static benchmark performance and vulnerability under
adversarial pressure. Despite a median MedQA accuracy exceeding 80\%, 94\% of
previously correct answers failed our dynamic robustness tests. We observed
similarly high failure rates across other domains: privacy leaks were elicited
in 86\% of scenarios, cognitive-bias priming altered clinical recommendations
in 81\% of fairness tests, and we identified hallucination rates exceeding 66\%
in widely used models. Such profound residual risks are incompatible with
routine clinical practice. By converting red-teaming from a static checklist
into a dynamic stress-test audit, DAS red-teaming offers the surveillance that
hospitals/regulators/technology vendors require as LLMs become embedded in
patient chatbots, decision-support dashboards, and broader healthcare
workflows. Our framework delivers an evolvable, scalable, and reliable
safeguard for the next generation of medical AI.

Result: 推导出与总奖励方差和测量分辨率相关的遗憾界限，表明在适当调整观测频率时，遗憾与具体测量策略无关。

Conclusion: 该算法为设计能够根据环境难度自动调整学习行为的CTRL算法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a natural framework
for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments where interactions
evolve continuously over time. While CTRL has shown growing empirical success,
its ability to adapt to varying levels of problem difficulty remains poorly
understood. In this work, we investigate the instance-dependent behavior of
CTRL and introduce a simple, model-based algorithm built on maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) with a general function approximator. Unlike existing
approaches that estimate system dynamics directly, our method estimates the
state marginal density to guide learning. We establish instance-dependent
performance guarantees by deriving a regret bound that scales with the total
reward variance and measurement resolution. Notably, the regret becomes
independent of the specific measurement strategy when the observation frequency
adapts appropriately to the problem's complexity. To further improve
performance, our algorithm incorporates a randomized measurement schedule that
enhances sample efficiency without increasing measurement cost. These results
highlight a new direction for designing CTRL algorithms that automatically
adjust their learning behavior based on the underlying difficulty of the
environment.

Motivation: 时序多模态数据（如视听数据）的分类任务面临长程依赖和跨模态交互的挑战，现有方法多忽略时序依赖和模态间复杂关系。

Method: HHN采用分段优先、图结构后续的策略，将序列分段为节点，通过超边捕捉模态内结构，利用超图卷积提取高阶依赖，并通过时序对齐和图注意力实现模态间语义融合。

Result: HHN在四个多模态数据集上取得了SOTA结果。

Conclusion: HHN通过分段和超图策略有效建模了时序多模态数据的复杂结构，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Modeling temporal multimodal data poses significant challenges in
classification tasks, particularly in capturing long-range temporal
dependencies and intricate cross-modal interactions. Audiovisual data, as a
representative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order
and diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is
essential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal
correlations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality
independently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal
dependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural
relationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph
network (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a
segmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped
segments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured
via hyperedges guided by a maximum entropy difference criterion, enhancing node
heterogeneity and structural discrimination, followed by hypergraph convolution
to extract high-order dependencies. Inter-modal links are established through
temporal alignment and graph attention for semantic fusion. HHN achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four multimodal datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness in complex classification tasks.

Conclusion: PTBCC通过原型学习机制，显著提升了标注者专业知识的估计质量，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Multi-class classification annotations have significantly advanced AI
applications, with truth inference serving as a critical technique for
aggregating noisy and biased annotations. Existing state-of-the-art methods
typically model each annotator's expertise using a confusion matrix. However,
these methods suffer from two widely recognized issues: 1) when most annotators
label only a few tasks, or when classes are imbalanced, the estimated confusion
matrices are unreliable, and 2) a single confusion matrix often remains
inadequate for capturing each annotator's full expertise patterns across all
tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel confusion-matrix-based
method, PTBCC (ProtoType learning-driven Bayesian Classifier Combination), to
introduce a reliable and richer annotator estimation by prototype learning.
Specifically, we assume that there exists a set $S$ of prototype confusion
matrices, which capture the inherent expertise patterns of all annotators.
Rather than a single confusion matrix, the expertise per annotator is extended
as a Dirichlet prior distribution over these prototypes. This prototype
learning-driven mechanism circumvents the data sparsity and class imbalance
issues, ensuring a richer and more flexible characterization of annotators.
Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTBCC achieves
up to a 15% accuracy improvement in the best case, and a 3% higher average
accuracy while reducing computational cost by over 90%.

Conclusion: Hi-Fi方法在XAI和复杂系统的高阶关系分析中具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of synergy and redundancy in
systems of random variables, an adaptive version of the widely used metric
Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO) has been recently proposed to quantify
cooperative effects in feature importance (Hi-Fi), a key technique in
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so as to disentangle high-order
effects involving a particular input feature in regression problems.
Differently from standard feature importance tools, where a single score
measures the relevance of each feature, each feature is here characterized by
three scores, a two-body (unique) score and higher-order scores (redundant and
synergistic). This paper presents a framework to assign those three scores
(unique, redundant, and synergistic) to each individual pattern of the data
set, while comparing it with the well-known measure of feature importance named
{\it Shapley effect}. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we
focus on a One-Health application: the relation between air pollutants and
Alzheimer's disease mortality rate. Our main result is the synergistic
association between features related to $O_3$ and $NO_2$ with mortality,
especially in the provinces of Bergamo e Brescia; notably also the density of
urban green areas displays synergistic influence with pollutants for the
prediction of AD mortality. Our results place local Hi-Fi as a promising tool
of wide applicability, which opens new perspectives for XAI as well as to
analyze high-order relationships in complex systems.

Abstract: While modern deep networks have demonstrated remarkable versatility, their
training dynamics remain poorly understood--often driven more by empirical
tweaks than architectural insight. This paper investigates how internal
structural choices shape the behavior of learning systems. Building on prior
efforts that introduced simple architectural constraints, we explore the
broader implications of structure for convergence, generalization, and
adaptation. Our approach centers on a family of enriched transformation layers
that incorporate constrained pathways and adaptive corrections. We analyze how
these structures influence gradient flow, spectral sensitivity, and fixed-point
behavior--uncovering mechanisms that contribute to training stability and
representational regularity. Theoretical analysis is paired with empirical
studies on synthetic and structured tasks, demonstrating improved robustness,
smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior. Rather than prescribing
fixed templates, we emphasize principles of tractable design that can steer
learning behavior in interpretable ways. Our findings support a growing view
that architectural design is not merely a matter of performance tuning, but a
critical axis for shaping learning dynamics in scalable and trustworthy neural
systems.

Result: 实验表明OKG-LLM优于现有方法，具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OKG-LLM为SST预测提供了新思路，展示了领域知识与数据驱动方法结合的潜力。

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) prediction is a critical task in ocean science,
supporting various applications, such as weather forecasting, fisheries
management, and storm tracking. While existing data-driven methods have
demonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich
domain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further
advancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language
models (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for
downstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains
underexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain
knowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge
Graph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To
the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to
construct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent
diverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding
network to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the
OKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and
the complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned
knowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM
to model SST patterns for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the
real-world dataset demonstrate that OKG-LLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness, robustness, and
potential to advance SST prediction. The codes are available in the online
repository.

<details>

Motivation: 贝叶斯优化的性能高度依赖核函数和采集函数的选择，但现有方法缺乏自动选择机制，导致性能不佳或资源浪费。

Method: BOOST通过轻量级离线评估阶段，预测不同核函数-采集函数组合的性能，并选择最优配置。

Result: 实验表明，BOOST在合成基准和实际任务中均优于固定超参数的标准贝叶斯优化方法。

Conclusion: BOOST是一种简单有效的自动化选择框架，适用于多样化问题场景。

Abstract: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient
method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the
selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition
functions. This presents a challenge: an inappropriate combination of these can
lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements
to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and
acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have
been explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these
fundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked. This forces practitioners to
rely on heuristics or costly manual training. We propose a simple yet effective
framework, BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition
Function Selection Technique), that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a
lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various
kernel-acquisition function pairs and identify the most suitable configuration
before expensive evaluations. BOOST partitions data-in-hand into two subsets: a
reference subset and a query subset, and it prepares all possible
kernel-acquisition pairs from the user's chosen candidates. For each
configuration, BOOST conducts internal BO runs using the reference subset,
evaluating how effectively each pair guides the search toward the optimum in
the unknown query subset, thereby identifying the configuration with the best
retrospective performance for future optimization. Experiments on both
synthetic benchmark functions and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks
demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO approaches with
fixed hyperparameters, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse
problem landscapes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FeatureCuts是一种新型特征选择算法，通过自适应选择最优特征截断点，显著减少特征数量和计算时间，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习中，特征选择旨在找到能够高效训练模型的特征子集，但现有方法在特征减少和计算效率上仍有改进空间。

Method: FeatureCuts结合过滤排序和自适应特征截断，选择最优特征子集，并在包装方法（如PSO）中进一步优化。

Result: 在14个公开数据集和1个行业数据集上，FeatureCuts平均减少15%的特征和99.6%的计算时间，同时保持性能；与PSO结合时，特征减少25%，计算时间减少66%。

Conclusion: FeatureCuts高效且可扩展，适用于企业级大规模数据集。

Abstract: In machine learning, the process of feature selection involves finding a
reduced subset of features that captures most of the information required to
train an accurate and efficient model. This work presents FeatureCuts, a novel
feature selection algorithm that adaptively selects the optimal feature cutoff
after performing filter ranking. Evaluated on 14 publicly available datasets
and one industry dataset, FeatureCuts achieved, on average, 15 percentage
points more feature reduction and up to 99.6% less computation time while
maintaining model performance, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
When the selected features are used in a wrapper method such as Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO), it enables 25 percentage points more feature reduction,
requires 66% less computation time, and maintains model performance when
compared to PSO alone. The minimal overhead of FeatureCuts makes it scalable
for large datasets typically seen in enterprise applications.

Result: 在MMEB基准上提升4.8分，无需对比预训练即达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为MLLM在通用嵌入任务中的应用提供了高效路径，显著减少训练时间。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution
for universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for
discriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The
dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical
inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to
leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To
overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal
multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic
components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a
two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce
discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second
component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process
by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging
negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our
comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot
performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the
fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8
points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our
self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance
without the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and
efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly
reducing training time.

TL;DR: U^2QT框架通过早期融合异构数据和多阶段架构解决了用户表示学习中的统一性、可扩展性和跨任务泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在统一表示框架、数据压缩可扩展性和跨任务泛化性方面的不足。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：1) 因果Q-Former将领域特征映射到共享表示空间；2) 多视图RQ-VAE将嵌入离散化为紧凑令牌。

Result: 在多种下游任务中表现优异，优于任务特定基线，同时提升了存储和计算效率。

Conclusion: U^2QT框架实现了高效、统一的用户表示，支持工业级应用并与语言模型无缝集成。

Abstract: Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling
personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have
adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they
suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks,
scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U^2QT (Unified User
Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge
transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a
two-stage architecture: first, a causal Q-Former projects domain-specific
features into a shared causal representation space to preserve inter-modality
dependencies; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into
compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient
storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase
U^2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific
baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while
achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization
framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports
industrial-scale applications.

Motivation: 解决零样本文本分类在动态领域（如票务系统）中因知识不断演变和类别边界模糊而面临的挑战。

Method: 结合迭代主题细化、对比提示和主动学习，通过人类参与调整类别定义。

Result: 在AGNews和DBpedia上分别达到91%和84%的准确率，引入新类别后性能稳定。

Conclusion: 基于提示的语义推理在有限监督下能有效实现细粒度分类。

Abstract: Zero-shot text classification remains a difficult task in domains with
evolving knowledge and ambiguous category boundaries, such as ticketing
systems. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generalize in these
scenarios due to limited topic separability, while few-shot methods are
constrained by insufficient data diversity. We propose a classification
framework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and
active learning. Starting with a small set of labeled samples, the model
generates initial topic labels. Misclassified or ambiguous samples are then
used in an iterative contrastive prompting process to refine category
distinctions by explicitly teaching the model to differentiate between closely
related classes. The framework features a human-in-the-loop component, allowing
users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language. This
enables seamless integration of new, unseen categories without retraining,
making the system well-suited for real-world, dynamic environments. The
evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy
on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with
minimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%,
respectively). The results highlight the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic
reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

Motivation: 大规模模型（LSM）在语义通信中具有潜力，但直接部署面临高计算复杂性和资源需求的挑战。

Method: 1. 提出KDL-DARTS算法，结合知识蒸馏和轻量级架构搜索；2. 开发两阶段鲁棒知识蒸馏（RKD）算法；3. 引入信道感知变换器（CAT）块增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在图像分类任务中，RKD-SC显著减少模型参数，同时保持高性能并优于现有方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RKD-SC框架为高效且鲁棒的LSM语义通信提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic
representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for
designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment
is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements.
In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic
communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and
\textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses
two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and
effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel
noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable
architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm
integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural
architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic
encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation
(RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM
(teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system
robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a
channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec,
trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs.
Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC
framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree
of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared
to existing methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的PGNNIV框架，通过降阶建模技术解决高维数据的可扩展性问题，提升了计算效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PGNNIV模型在处理高维数据时面临可扩展性挑战，需要改进以提升效率和适应性。

Method: 引入基于谱分解、POD和预训练自编码器的替代解码器，结合迁移学习和微调策略。

Result: 改进后的框架成功识别了本构状态方程，提高了预测精度、噪声鲁棒性，并减少了计算需求。

Conclusion: 提出的技术可根据不同需求定制，有效解决了PGNNIV的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools
that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel
internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by
prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing
certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables.
Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when
applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or
time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV
framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order
modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original
decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained
autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs
between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and
generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we
integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to
exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel
materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while
maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various
techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion
equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced
PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state
equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves
robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands.
The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data
availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming
scalability challenges in all the scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统分割学习（SL）在恶意客户端攻击下模型准确性下降的问题。

Method: 将客户端分为N+1个集群，独立训练并验证损失，仅保留损失最低的集群；Pigeon-SL+进一步优化训练和通信效率。

Result: 在三种典型攻击模型下验证了方法的鲁棒性和有效性，显著优于基线SL方法。

Conclusion: Pigeon-SL为未来智能无线网络提供了一种高效、安全的分布式学习方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in split learning (SL) have established it as a promising
framework for privacy-preserving, communication-efficient distributed learning
at the network edge. However, SL's sequential update process is vulnerable to
even a single malicious client, which can significantly degrade model accuracy.
To address this, we introduce Pigeon-SL, a novel scheme grounded in the
pigeonhole principle that guarantees at least one entirely honest cluster among
M clients, even when up to N of them are adversarial. In each global round, the
access point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster
independently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared
dataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and
discarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication
efficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to
match the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label
flipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant
improvements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future
intelligent wireless networks.

Conclusion: 幻影并行方法显著提高了能源效率，为可持续大规模机器学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Energy efficiency of training and inferencing with large neural network
models is a critical challenge facing the future of sustainable large-scale
machine learning workloads. This paper introduces an alternative strategy,
called phantom parallelism, to minimize the net energy consumption of
traditional tensor (model) parallelism, the most energy-inefficient component
of large neural network training. The approach is presented in the context of
feed-forward network architectures as a preliminary, but comprehensive,
proof-of-principle study of the proposed methodology. We derive new forward and
backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implement them as
custom autograd operations within an end-to-end phantom parallel training
pipeline and compare its parallel performance and energy-efficiency against
those of conventional tensor parallel training pipelines. Formal analyses that
predict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts are presented with supporting empirical
results on up to 256 GPUs that corroborate these gains. Experiments are shown
to deliver ~50% reduction in the energy consumed to train FFNs using the
proposed phantom parallel approach when compared with conventional tensor
parallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to train smaller
phantom models to the same model loss on smaller GPU counts as larger tensor
parallel models on larger GPU counts offering the possibility for even greater
energy savings.

Conclusion: FinKario和FinKario-RAG有效解决了金融知识更新慢和非结构化问题，显著提升了LLMs的金融分析能力。

Abstract: Individual investors are significantly outnumbered and disadvantaged in
financial markets, overwhelmed by abundant information and lacking professional
analysis. Equity research reports stand out as crucial resources, offering
valuable insights. By leveraging these reports, large language models (LLMs)
can enhance investors' decision-making capabilities and strengthen financial
analysis. However, two key challenges limit their effectiveness: (1) the rapid
evolution of market events often outpaces the slow update cycles of existing
knowledge bases, (2) the long-form and unstructured nature of financial reports
further hinders timely and context-aware integration by LLMs. To address these
challenges, we tackle both data and methodological aspects. First, we introduce
the Event-Enhanced Automated Construction of Financial Knowledge Graph
(FinKario), a dataset comprising over 305,360 entities, 9,625 relational
triples, and 19 distinct relation types. FinKario automatically integrates
real-time company fundamentals and market events through prompt-driven
extraction guided by professional institutional templates, providing structured
and accessible financial insights for LLMs. Additionally, we propose a
Two-Stage, Graph-Based retrieval strategy (FinKario-RAG), optimizing the
retrieval of evolving, large-scale financial knowledge to ensure efficient and
precise data access. Extensive experiments show that FinKario with FinKario-RAG
achieves superior stock trend prediction accuracy, outperforming financial LLMs
by 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% on average in backtesting.

Motivation: 探索多模态融合在生物医学信号分类中的实际效果，挑战传统认为‘更多模态更好’的假设。

Method: 设计并评估五种深度学习模型（三种单模态和两种多模态），通过统计和贝叶斯分析验证性能。

Conclusion: 多模态设计的核心在于特征域的内在互补性，而非数量，提出量化框架以优化融合策略。

Abstract: This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for
biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary
feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often
presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can
yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To
validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and
rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for
time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal
(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,
2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian
inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline
across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming
the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.
Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further
improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational
redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.
This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in
biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't
about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent
complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic
feature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, "Complementary Feature
Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning," presents a mathematically
quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating
that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic
information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.

Conclusion: VAULT通过自动化对抗数据生成和训练，显著提升了NLI模型的鲁棒性，且无需人工干预。

Abstract: We introduce VAULT, a fully automated adversarial RAG pipeline that
systematically uncovers and remedies weaknesses in NLI models through three
stages: retrieval, adversarial generation, and iterative retraining. First, we
perform balanced few-shot retrieval by embedding premises with both semantic
(BGE) and lexical (BM25) similarity. Next, we assemble these contexts into LLM
prompts to generate adversarial hypotheses, which are then validated by an LLM
ensemble for label fidelity. Finally, the validated adversarial examples are
injected back into the training set at increasing mixing ratios, progressively
fortifying a zero-shot RoBERTa-base model.On standard benchmarks, VAULT
elevates RoBERTa-base accuracy from 88.48% to 92.60% on SNLI +4.12%, from
75.04% to 80.95% on ANLI +5.91%, and from 54.67% to 71.99% on MultiNLI +17.32%.
It also consistently outperforms prior in-context adversarial methods by up to
2.0% across datasets. By automating high-quality adversarial data curation at

Motivation: 组织病理学数据不足以全面表征分子特征和临床结果，多组学数据（如转录组、甲基化组、基因组）包含重要信息，但缺乏统一的建模方法。

Method: MORPHEUS通过掩码建模目标对随机选择的多组学部分进行预训练，学习跨模态关系，支持单模态或多模态输入。

Conclusion: MORPHEUS是一个有前景的多模态基础模型框架，适用于肿瘤学研究。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven major advances in computational pathology
by enabling models to learn rich representations from hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained cancer tissue. However, histopathology alone often falls short
for molecular characterization and understanding clinical outcomes, as
important information is contained in high-dimensional omics profiles like
transcriptomics, methylomics, or genomics. In this work, we introduce MORPHEUS,
a unified transformer-based pre-training framework that encodes both
histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. At its core,
MORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected
omics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful
cross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to
histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities,
seamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables
any-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred
from any subset of modalities, including H&E alone. Pre-trained on a large
pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a
promising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology.

Result: 在Mistral-7B模型上，SLAI将中位TTFT降低53%，最大服务容量提升26%，同时满足尾部TBT延迟约束。

Conclusion: SLAI调度器显著提升了LLM推理系统的性能和效率。

Abstract: With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini across industries, there is a rising need for efficient
LLM inference systems. These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase
computation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and
a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This
structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.
  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by
developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM
inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and
dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput.
Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD)
scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild
conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as
serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design
the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements
to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and
reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the
Time To First Token (TTFT) delays.
  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model
on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the
median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that
median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.

Abstract: Conventional deep learning models embed data in Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, a poor fit for strictly hierarchical objects such as taxa, word
senses, or file systems. We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs),
the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic
balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation
Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact
subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a
depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents
any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose
Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic
variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three

ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and
information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive
structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative
codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and
deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for
hierarchical data.

Abstract: Multi-fidelity optimization employs surrogate models that integrate
information from varying levels of fidelity to guide efficient exploration of
complex design spaces while minimizing the reliance on (expensive)
high-fidelity objective function evaluations. To advance Gaussian Process
(GP)-based multi-fidelity optimization, we implement a proximity-based
acquisition strategy that simplifies fidelity selection by eliminating the need
for separate acquisition functions at each fidelity level. We also enable
multi-fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies by combining them with
multi-fidelity GPs rather than the standard GPs typically used. We benchmark
these approaches alongside other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies
(including fidelity-weighted approaches) comparing their performance, reliance
on high-fidelity evaluations, and hyperparameter tunability in representative
optimization tasks. The results highlight the capability of the proximity-based
multi-fidelity acquisition function to deliver consistent control over
high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency. Our illustrative
examples include multi-fidelity chemical kinetic models, both homogeneous and
heterogeneous (dynamic catalysis for ammonia production).

Abstract: In recent years, the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) on
graph-structured data has prompted a surge of methods for explaining GNN
predictions. However, the state-of-the-art for GNN explainability remains in
flux. Different comparisons find mixed results for different methods, with many
explainers struggling on more complex GNN architectures and tasks. This
presents an urgent need for a more careful theoretical analysis of competing
GNN explanation methods. In this work we take a closer look at GNN explanations
in two different settings: input-level explanations, which produce explanatory
subgraphs of the input graph, and layerwise explanations, which produce
explanatory subgraphs of the computation graph. We establish the first
theoretical connections between the popular perturbation-based and classical
gradient-based methods, as well as point out connections between other recently
proposed methods. At the input level, we demonstrate conditions under which
GNNExplainer can be approximated by a simple heuristic based on the sign of the
edge gradients. In the layerwise setting, we point out that edge gradients are
equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs. Finally, we demonstrate how our
theoretical results manifest in practice with experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets.

Abstract: Independent on-policy policy gradient algorithms are widely used for
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and no-conflict games,
but they are known to converge suboptimally when each agent's policy gradient
points toward a suboptimal equilibrium. In this work, we identify a subtler
failure mode that arises \textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all
agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of
trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint
data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution.
This \textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces
inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In
this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through
coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of
policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive
action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method,
Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized
behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint
actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We
empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and
demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently
than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of
independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training
runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry.
However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction
and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information.
Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links
molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more
interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks.
Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden
relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties,
thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce
FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with
functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and
localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability
thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both
regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across
three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group
impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular
comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the
results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning,
highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry
tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct
datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational
framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better
understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset

results, in particular hinting at the possibility for using lattice basis

Motivation: 学习动态系统在许多领域至关重要，但由于缺失变量和噪声数据，传统数学模型难以应对。随机机器学习技术为解决这类不适定问题提供了可能。

Method: 提出了一种流匹配的变体方法，用于概率预测，并采用生成式机器学习技术对高维动态系统状态进行物理和逻辑扰动。

Result: 在多个挑战性动态系统上验证了方法的有效性，包括高维WeatherBench数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态系统的概率预测提供了新的解决方案，特别是在处理高维和复杂系统时表现出色。

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying
machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and
noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due
to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning
techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed
problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may
yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such
scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study,
we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which
estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes
rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states
is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to
crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a
Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to
physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional
dynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our
method and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical
systems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset,
which models the global weather at a 5.625{\deg} meridional resolution.

Abstract: Student mental health is an increasing concern in academic institutions,
where stress can severely impact well-being and academic performance.
Traditional assessment methods rely on subjective surveys and periodic
evaluations, offering limited value for timely intervention. This paper
introduces a context-aware machine learning framework for classifying student
stress using two complementary survey-based datasets covering psychological,
academic, environmental, and social factors. The framework follows a six-stage
pipeline involving preprocessing, feature selection (SelectKBest, RFECV),
dimensionality reduction (PCA), and training with six base classifiers: SVM,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bagging. To enhance
performance, we implement ensemble strategies, including hard voting, soft
voting, weighted voting, and stacking. Our best models achieve 93.09% accuracy
with weighted hard voting on the Student Stress Factors dataset and 99.53% with
stacking on the Stress and Well-being dataset, surpassing previous benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of context-integrated, data-driven
systems for early stress detection and underscore their applicability in
real-world academic settings to support student well-being.

Result: 离线分析显示BUS显著优于传统方法，线上测试也取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: BUS是首个结合用户属性和行为的大规模工业级推荐框架，具有语义可解释性。

Abstract: User attributes are essential in multiple stages of modern recommendation
systems and are particularly important for mitigating the cold-start problem
and improving the experience of new or infrequent users. We propose
Behavior-based User Segmentation (BUS), a novel tree-based data structure that
hierarchically segments the user universe with various users' categorical
attributes based on the users' product-specific engagement behaviors. During
the BUS tree construction, we use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
as the objective function to maximize the behavioral representativeness of
marginal users relative to active users in the same segment. The constructed
BUS tree undergoes further processing and aggregation across the leaf nodes and
internal nodes, allowing the generation of popular social content and
behavioral patterns for each node in the tree. To further mitigate bias and
improve fairness, we use the social graph to derive the user's connection-based
BUS segments, enabling the combination of behavioral patterns extracted from
both the user's own segment and connection-based segments as the connection
aware BUS-based recommendation. Our offline analysis shows that the BUS-based
retrieval significantly outperforms traditional user cohort-based aggregation
on ranking quality. We have successfully deployed our data structure and
machine learning algorithm and tested it with various production traffic
serving billions of users daily, achieving statistically significant
improvements in the online product metrics, including music ranking and email
notifications. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first
list-wise learning-to-rank framework for tree-based recommendation that
effectively integrates diverse user categorical attributes while preserving
real-world semantic interpretability at a large industrial scale.

Result: Transformer生成的随机数通过大多数NIST测试，热图显示明显的统计随机性，并评估了其在预测攻击中的能力。

Conclusion: 解码器专用Transformer模型能够有效模拟PRNGs，生成高质量的伪随机数，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are high-nonlinear processes, and
they are key blocks in optimization of Large language models. Transformers
excel at processing complex nonlinear relationships. Thus it is reasonable to
generate high-quality pseudo-random numbers based on transformers. In this
paper, we explore this question from both theoretical and practical
perspectives, highlighting the potential benefits and implications of
Transformer in PRNGs. We theoretically demonstrate that decoder-only
Transformer models with Chain-of-Thought can simulate both the Linear
Congruential Generator (LCG) and Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNGs. Based on this, we
conclude that the log-precision decoder-only Transformer can represent
non-uniform $\text{AC}^0$. Our simulative theoretical findings are validated
through experiments. The random numbers generated by Transformer-based PRNGs
successfully pass the majority of NIST tests, whose heat maps exhibit clear
statistical randomness. Finally, we assess their capability in prediction
attacks.

Result: 实验表明，DisTaC能显著提升现有合并技术的性能，使其在原本会失败的情况下成功合并模型。

Conclusion: DisTaC通过预处理任务向量，有效增强了模型合并的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient and flexible paradigm for
multi-task learning, with numerous methods being proposed in recent years.
However, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark
suites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more
realistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first
investigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the
source-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we
identify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1)
disparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source
models. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector
Conditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task
vectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a
task vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its
essential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that
by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging
techniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits --
where they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 终身模仿学习的主要挑战在于平衡灾难性遗忘和新技能获取，现有方法通常孤立处理这些问题，忽略了它们的内在关联。

Method: T2S通过将模型参数标记化，将传统Transformer的线性参数映射转化为输入与可学习标记之间的交叉注意力，并通过语言引导技能扩展实现高效知识迁移。

Result: 实验表明，T2S在防止灾难性遗忘（NBT平均1.0%）、新技能扩展（仅需8.0%可训练标记）和任务间知识迁移（FWT平均77.7%）方面表现优异。

Conclusion: T2S为终身模仿学习提供了一个有效的解决方案，兼具高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The main challenge in lifelong imitation learning lies in the balance between
mitigating catastrophic forgetting of previous skills while maintaining
sufficient capacity for acquiring new ones. However, current approaches
typically address these aspects in isolation, overlooking their internal
correlation in lifelong skill acquisition. We address this limitation with a
unified framework named Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S). Specifically, by
tokenizing the model parameters, the linear parameter mapping of the
traditional transformer is transformed into cross-attention between input and
learnable tokens, thereby enhancing model scalability through the easy
extension of new tokens. Additionally, we introduce language-guided skill
scaling to transfer knowledge across tasks efficiently and avoid linearly
growing parameters. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that
T2S: 1) effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting (achieving an average NBT
of 1.0% across the three LIBERO task suites), 2) excels in new skill scaling
with minimal increases in trainable parameters (needing only 8.0% trainable
tokens in an average of lifelong tasks), and 3) enables efficient knowledge
transfer between tasks (achieving an average FWT of 77.7% across the three
LIBERO task suites), offering a promising solution for lifelong imitation
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习模型在动态市场条件下难以平衡风险与回报，MARS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MARS采用异构智能体集合，每个智能体具有独特的风险偏好，并通过Meta-Adaptive Controller动态调整组合策略。

Result: 实验表明，MARS在风险调整后表现优异，显著降低了最大回撤和波动率，同时保持了竞争力回报。

Conclusion: MARS通过行为多样性和动态调整，实现了对市场波动的稳健适应，优化了风险与回报的平衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated
portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a
central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market
conditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware
System (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this
limitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single
monolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent
possesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a
dedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,
allowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to
aggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level
Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.
By adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC
effectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher
returns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall
stability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and
adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework
achieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral
diversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major
international stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis,
demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria,
significantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining
competitive returns.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型的后训练优化采用风险中性目标，而评估却依赖风险寻求指标（如Pass@k和Max@k），导致性能不佳。

Method: RSPO通过利用闭式概率解决低奖励响应被无意强化的问题，生成高效且无偏的梯度估计器。

Result: 通过理论分析和实验验证，RSPO有效优化了目标指标。

Conclusion: RSPO成功填补了训练与评估之间的风险偏好差距，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Current large language model post-training optimizes a risk-neutral objective
that maximizes expected reward, yet evaluation relies heavily on risk-seeking
metrics like Pass@k (at least one success in k trials) and Max@k (maximum
reward across k responses). This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably
lead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking
Policy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and
Max@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the
"hitchhiking" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if
they co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations,
resulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by
leveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum
among k samplings. Despite the complexity of nested gradients over multiple
responses, RSPO produces efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for both
metrics. We validate our approach with both rigorous theoretical analysis and
comprehensive experimental results.

Conclusion: PLU将网络从分段泰勒近似器转变为傅里叶式函数合成器，实现了参数效率的指数级提升。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple,
monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this
paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate
complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU),
a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is
designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through
its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization,
which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear
function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve
the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using
standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise
Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers,
achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in
the neuron itself.

Abstract: Deep learning holds immense promise for spectroscopy, yet research and
evaluation in this emerging field often lack standardized formulations. To
address this issue, we introduce SpectrumLab, a pioneering unified platform
designed to systematize and accelerate deep learning research in spectroscopy.
SpectrumLab integrates three core components: a comprehensive Python library
featuring essential data processing and evaluation tools, along with
leaderboards; an innovative SpectrumAnnotator module that generates
high-quality benchmarks from limited seed data; and SpectrumBench, a
multi-layered benchmark suite covering 14 spectroscopic tasks and over 10
spectrum types, featuring spectra curated from over 1.2 million distinct
chemical substances. Thorough empirical studies on SpectrumBench with 18
cutting-edge multimodal LLMs reveal critical limitations of current approaches.
We hope SpectrumLab will serve as a crucial foundation for future advancements
in deep learning-driven spectroscopy.

Abstract: Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health,
prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent
years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key
tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data
processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing
computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to
fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack
algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address
these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced,
open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven
core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced
technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition
to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark
datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on
generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with
existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a
comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery,
offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for
real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical
utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor,
successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro
electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and
comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery.

Motivation: 解决图中节点特征缺失时，传统GNN方法性能下降的问题，尤其是在仅有少量特征可用时表现不佳。

Method: 结合标签传播和特征传播分支，设计GNN解码器对齐嵌入，引入结构-特征注意力和伪标签对比学习。

Result: GOODIE在少量或丰富特征情况下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GOODIE通过混合方法和新设计模块有效提升了缺失特征场景下的性能。

Abstract: In real-world graphs, we often encounter missing feature situations where a
few or the majority of node features, e.g., sensitive information, are missed.
In such scenarios, directly utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would yield
sub-optimal results in downstream tasks such as node classification. Despite
the emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing
situation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse
than traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel
framework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation
(Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a
partial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach
to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation
branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label
Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP
branch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and
feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention.
Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the
contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP
branch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE,
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few
features are available but also in abundantly available situations. Source code
of GOODIE is available at: https://github.com/SukwonYun/GOODIE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经算子方法需大量数据且无法跨PDE家族泛化，需数据高效且通用的算子学习方法。

Result: 在Darcy Flow和Navier Stokes等基准上，MOFS在少样本泛化中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOFS为跨科学领域的通用和数据高效算子学习提供了新基础。

Abstract: Learning solution operators for partial differential equations (PDEs) has
become a foundational task in scientific machine learning. However, existing
neural operator methods require abundant training data for each specific PDE
and lack the ability to generalize across PDE families. In this work, we
propose MOFS: a unified multimodal framework for multi-operator few-shot
learning, which aims to generalize to unseen PDE operators using only a few
demonstration examples. Our method integrates three key components: (i)
multi-task self-supervised pretraining of a shared Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO) encoder to reconstruct masked spatial fields and predict frequency
spectra, (ii) text-conditioned operator embeddings derived from statistical
summaries of input-output fields, and (iii) memory-augmented multimodal
prompting with gated fusion and cross-modal gradient-based attention. We adopt
a two-stage training paradigm that first learns prompt-conditioned inference on
seen operators and then applies end-to-end contrastive fine-tuning to align
latent representations across vision, frequency, and text modalities.
Experiments on PDE benchmarks, including Darcy Flow and Navier Stokes variants,
demonstrate that our model outperforms existing operator learning baselines in
few-shot generalization. Extensive ablations validate the contributions of each
modality and training component. Our approach offers a new foundation for
universal and data-efficient operator learning across scientific domains.

Result: 模型在数据插补、参考数据改进及不确定性可视化方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了空间插值的可靠性和可视化效果。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable visualization of spatiotemporal sensor data such as
environmental parameters and meteorological conditions is crucial for informed
decision-making. Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall
short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and
irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation
pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel
heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage
imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance
visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal
Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our
model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based
heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various
sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our
model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the
interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization
design in communicating uncertainties.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在联邦无监督学习中难以实现全局均匀性，主要由于非独立同分布数据和去中心化特性。

Method: 提出SSD方法，通过软分离和蒸馏模块减少客户端模型聚合时的干扰，并引入投影器蒸馏模块优化表示质量。

Result: 在跨设备和跨场景的联邦设置中，SSD显著提升了表示质量和任务性能。

Conclusion: SSD有效解决了FUL中的全局均匀性问题，强调了其重要性。

Abstract: Federated Unsupervised Learning (FUL) aims to learn expressive
representations in federated and self-supervised settings. The quality of
representations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure
of how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space.
However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local)
uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global)
uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the
decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation
and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity
by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions.
This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby
improving global uniformity while preserving local representation
expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector
distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and
representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device
federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation
quality and task performance across various training scenarios. Our results
highlight the importance of inter-client uniformity in FUL and establish SSD as
an effective solution to this challenge. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决元强化学习中探索与利用的平衡问题，探索是否可以通过贪婪目标自然涌现。

Method: 提出三个条件（环境结构重复性、代理记忆、长期信用分配），并通过实验验证这些条件对探索行为的影响。

Result: 在满足条件1和2时，贪婪目标训练的代理表现出探索行为；条件3的缺失不一定阻止探索。

Conclusion: 探索行为可以在特定条件下自然涌现，无需显式分离探索与利用目标。

Abstract: Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training
meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments.
Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit
incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to
encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained
solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless
exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1)
Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable
regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent
Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data;
and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over
a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform
current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and
temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory
are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits
information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through
controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either
environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2).
Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not
always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the
pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right
prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal
objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，FedCD优于五种FL方法，实现了公平且精确的诊断。

Conclusion: FedCD有效解决了隐私保护和公平性问题，为联邦学习在教育领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Online intelligent education platforms have generated a vast amount of
distributed student learning data. This influx of data presents opportunities
for cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts
while also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope
with this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by
jointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their
original data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability
differences and educational context differences between different
groups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of
models. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware
federated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models
built upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,
preserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students
on each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the
students in each client based on its local student learning data, and each
client uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter
aggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The
main idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the
first is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic
function-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;
the second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,
containing exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware
aggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness. Experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedCD
framework and the personalization strategy compared to five FL approaches under
three CD models.

Motivation: 现有方法在动态映射暴露和灾害方面有进展，但对大规模物理脆弱性的理解仍静态且不足，需结合时间序列卫星数据改进。

Method: 利用机器学习方法，提出GraphVSSM框架，整合图深度学习、状态空间建模和变分推理，结合时间序列数据和专家知识。

Conclusion: GraphVSSM不仅提升了区域灾害韧性评估，还为全球灾害风险减少提供了新工具，同时推动了弱监督下的深度学习应用。

Abstract: Regional disaster resilience quantifies the changing nature of physical risks
to inform policy instruments ranging from local immediate recovery to
international sustainable development. While many existing state-of-practice
methods have greatly advanced the dynamic mapping of exposure and hazard, our
understanding of large-scale physical vulnerability has remained static,
costly, limited, region-specific, coarse-grained, overly aggregated, and
inadequately calibrated. With the significant growth in the availability of
time-series satellite imagery and derived products for exposure and hazard, we
focus our work on the equally important yet challenging element of the risk
equation: physical vulnerability. We leverage machine learning methods that
flexibly capture spatial contextual relationships, limited temporal
observations, and uncertainty in a unified probabilistic spatiotemporal
inference framework. We therefore introduce Graph Variational State-Space Model
(GraphVSSM), a novel modular spatiotemporal approach that uniquely integrates
graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using
time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a weakly supervised or
coarse-to-fine-grained manner. We present three major results: a city-wide
demonstration in Quezon City, Philippines; an investigation of sudden changes
in the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community (Bangladesh) and
mudslide-affected Freetown (Sierra Leone); and an open geospatial dataset,
METEOR 2.5D, that spatiotemporally enhances the existing global static dataset
for UN Least Developed Countries (2020). Beyond advancing regional disaster
resilience assessment and improving our understanding global disaster risk
reduction progress, our method also offers a probabilistic deep learning
approach, contributing to broader urban studies that require compositional data
analysis in weak supervision.

Method: 研究比较了标准PINN和向后兼容PINN（BC-PINN）的训练方法，并通过放松物理约束和动态加权损失函数来优化性能。

Result: PINN模型能够从稀疏数据中学习物理规律，并准确重建流场，尤其在3D湍流场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: PINNs在稀疏数据下具有潜力，但仍需进一步研究以优化其在复杂场景中的应用。

Abstract: The utilization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in physical science and
engineering applications has gained traction due to their capacity to learn
intricate functions. While large datasets are crucial for training DNN models
in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, obtaining such
datasets for engineering applications is prohibitively expensive.
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a branch of Physics-Informed Machine
Learning (PIML), tackle this challenge by embedding physical principles within
neural network architectures. PINNs have been extensively explored for solving
diverse forward and inverse problems in fluid mechanics. Nonetheless, there is
limited research on employing PINNs for flow reconstruction from sparse data
under constrained computational resources. Earlier studies were focused on
forward problems with well-defined data. The present study attempts to develop
models capable of reconstructing the flow field data from sparse datasets
mirroring real-world scenarios.
  This study focuses on two cases: (a) two-dimensional (2D) unsteady laminar
flow past a circular cylinder and (b) three-dimensional (3D) unsteady turbulent
flow past an ultra-large container ship (ULCS). The first case compares the
effectiveness of training methods like Standard PINN and Backward Compatible
PINN (BC-PINN) and explores the performance enhancements through systematic
relaxation of physics constraints and dynamic weighting of loss function
components. The second case highlights the capability of PINN-based models to
learn underlying physics from sparse data while accurately reconstructing the
flow field for a highly turbulent flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据分区方法（如KFCV）在计算资源和数据平衡性方面存在不足，而SRS虽然简单但可能导致非代表性样本。研究旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FSV结合了SRS和KFCV的优势，通过加权因子进一步优化性能。实验使用了三个不同规模的数据集，评估了多种指标（如ME、VE、MSE等）。

Result: FSV在所有指标上均优于SRS和KFCV，表现出更高的准确性和可靠性，尤其是在资源受限和大规模数据集场景中。

Conclusion: FSV为机器学习中的数据分区提供了更有效的解决方案，特别适用于资源受限和大规模数据集的场景。

Abstract: Effective data partitioning is known to be crucial in machine learning.
Traditional cross-validation methods like K-Fold Cross-Validation (KFCV)
enhance model robustness but often compromise generalisation assessment due to
high computational demands and extensive data shuffling. To address these
issues, the integration of the Simple Random Sampling (SRS), which, despite
providing representative samples, can result in non-representative sets with
imbalanced data. The study introduces a hybrid model, Fusion Sampling
Validation (FSV), combining SRS and KFCV to optimise data partitioning. FSV
aims to minimise biases and merge the simplicity of SRS with the accuracy of
KFCV. The study used three datasets of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 samples,
generated with a normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) and initialised with
seed 42. KFCV was performed with five folds and ten repetitions, incorporating
a scaling factor to ensure robust performance estimation and generalisation
capability. FSV integrated a weighted factor to enhance performance and
generalisation further. Evaluations focused on mean estimates (ME), variance
estimates (VE), mean squared error (MSE), bias, the rate of convergence for
mean estimates (ROC\_ME), and the rate of convergence for variance estimates
(ROC\_VE). Results indicated that FSV consistently outperformed SRS and KFCV,
with ME values of 0.000863, VE of 0.949644, MSE of 0.952127, bias of 0.016288,
ROC\_ME of 0.005199, and ROC\_VE of 0.007137. FSV demonstrated superior
accuracy and reliability in data partitioning, particularly in
resource-constrained environments and extensive datasets, providing practical
solutions for effective machine learning implementations.

Motivation: 在深度强化学习中，由于状态和动作分布的变化，训练深度学习策略可能导致次优性能甚至崩溃。社区担心即使改进探索算法或奖励目标，优化困难仍会阻碍进步。

Method: 提出了一种新的实用次优性估计器，通过实验评估不同环境和RL算法的优化限制。

Result: 实验表明，生成的最佳经验与策略学习性能之间的差距为2-3倍，表明深度RL方法仅利用了一半的好经验。

Conclusion: 深度RL方法的优化限制显著，仅能部分利用生成的好经验，需要进一步改进优化策略。

Abstract: In the era of deep reinforcement learning, making progress is more complex,
as the collected experience must be compressed into a deep model for future
exploitation and sampling. Many papers have shown that training a deep learning
policy under the changing state and action distribution leads to sub-optimal
performance, or even collapse. This naturally leads to the concern that even if
the community creates improved exploration algorithms or reward objectives,
will those improvements fall on the \textit{deaf ears} of optimization
difficulties. This work proposes a new \textit{practical} sub-optimality
estimator to determine optimization limitations of deep reinforcement learning
algorithms. Through experiments across environments and RL algorithms, it is
shown that the difference between the best experience generated is 2-3$\times$
better than the policies' learned performance. This large difference indicates
that deep RL methods only exploit half of the good experience they generate.

Conclusion: 为LoRA-based FL提供了理论支持，明确了聚合策略的选择依据。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing
size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation
challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into
FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by
updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its
effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains
a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified
convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current
aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS).
Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive a
general convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present
several sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence of the global model.
These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various
aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation
methods both satisfy our convergence condition, but differ in their ability to
achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Accurate, explainable and physically-credible forecasting remains a
persistent challenge for multivariate time-series whose statistical properties
vary across domains. We present CPformer, a Concept- and Physics-enhanced
Transformer that channels every prediction through five self-supervised,
domain-agnostic concepts while enforcing differentiable residuals drawn from
first-principle constraints. Unlike prior efficiency-oriented Transformers that
rely purely on sparsity or frequency priors , CPformer combines latent
transparency with hard scientific guidance while retaining attention for long
contexts. We tested CPformer on six publicly-available datasets: sub-hourly
Electricity and Traffic, hourly ETT, high-dimensional Weather, weekly
Influenza-like Illness, and minute-level Exchange Rate, and CPformer achieves
the lowest error in eight of twelve MSE/MAE cells. Relative to the strongest
Transformer baseline (FEDformer), CPformer reduces mean-squared-error by 23% on

machine learning models can be used to forecast the closing prices of the
XRP/USDT trading pair. While many existing cryptocurrency prediction models
focus solely on price and volume patterns, they often overlook market
liquidity, a crucial factor in price predictability. To address this, we
introduce two important liquidity proxy metrics: the Volume-To-Volatility Ratio
(VVR) and the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). These metrics provide a
clearer understanding of market stability and liquidity, ultimately enhancing
the accuracy of our price predictions. We developed four machine learning
models, Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks,
using historical data without incorporating the liquidity proxy metrics, and
evaluated their performance. We then retrained the models, including the
liquidity proxy metrics, and reassessed their performance. In both cases (with
and without the liquidity proxies), the LSTM model consistently outperformed
the others. These results underscore the importance of considering market
liquidity when predicting cryptocurrency closing prices. Therefore,
incorporating these liquidity metrics is essential for more accurate
forecasting models. Our findings offer valuable insights for traders and
developers seeking to create smarter and more risk-aware strategies in the U.S.
digital assets market.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型对多样化极端天气事件的预测能力有限，未能捕捉其频谱差异和地理混合特征。

Method: 提出UniExtreme模型，包含自适应频率调制模块（AFM）和事件先验增强模块（EPA），分别处理频谱差异和极端事件多样性。

Result: 实验表明UniExtreme在极端和一般天气预测中均优于现有基准模型。

Conclusion: UniExtreme展示了在多样化极端场景中的卓越适应性，为极端天气预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of
Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict
extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on
general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting
the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this
work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral
disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and
geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose
UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that
integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures
region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through
learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation,
and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates
region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity
and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior
adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回归任务中目标分布不平衡会导致模型忽视少数样本，现有方法依赖固定阈值，无法准确识别稀疏区域。

Method: 使用GAN框架结合Mahalanobis-Gaussian混合模型自动识别少数样本，并通过最近邻匹配增强稀疏区域。

Result: 在32个基准数据集上表现优于现有数据增强方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据驱动的方式有效解决了回归任务中的不平衡问题，无需预设阈值。

Abstract: Imbalanced regression arises when the target distribution is skewed, causing
models to focus on dense regions and struggle with underrepresented (minority)
samples. Despite its relevance across many applications, few methods have been
designed specifically for this challenge. Existing approaches often rely on
fixed, ad hoc thresholds to label samples as rare or common, overlooking the
continuous complexity of the joint feature-target space and fail to represent
the true underlying rare regions. To address these limitations, we propose a
fully data-driven GAN-based augmentation framework that uses
Mahalanobis-Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to automatically identify minority
samples and employs deterministic nearest-neighbour matching to enrich sparse
regions. Rather than preset thresholds, our method lets the data determine
which observations are truly rare. Evaluation on 32 benchmark imbalanced
regression datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data augmentation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的计算机辅助合成规划（CASP）系统在高通量药物设计中因高延迟而受限，需改进以满足严格的时间要求。

Method: 结合推测性束搜索和Medusa策略，优化SMILES-to-SMILES变换器的多步合成规划。

Result: 在相同时间限制下，CASP系统能解决26%至86%更多的分子。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了延迟，使CASP系统更适用于高通量合成筛选和提升用户体验。

Abstract: AI-based computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) systems are in demand as
components of AI-driven drug discovery workflows. However, the high latency of
such CASP systems limits their utility for high-throughput synthesizability
screening in de novo drug design. We propose a method for accelerating
multi-step synthesis planning systems that rely on SMILES-to-SMILES
transformers as single-step retrosynthesis models. Our approach reduces the
latency of SMILES-to-SMILES transformers powering multi-step synthesis planning
in AiZynthFinder through speculative beam search combined with a scalable
drafting strategy called Medusa. Replacing standard beam search with our
approach allows the CASP system to solve 26\% to 86\% more molecules under the
same time constraints of several seconds. Our method brings AI-based CASP
systems closer to meeting the strict latency requirements of high-throughput
synthesizability screening and improving general user experience.

Conclusion: 历史标记有效解决了Transformer在序列分类任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data,
including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series.
Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks.
However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the
objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of
transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and
effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that
contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context,
which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we
introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of
historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach
significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results
in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on
GitHub.

TL;DR: AutochaosNet是一种无需超参数调整和训练的改进版Neurochaos Learning（NL）算法，通过使用Champernowne常数生成的混沌序列简化特征提取，性能优于或与现有NL算法相当，同时显著减少计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL算法需要调整多个超参数并为每个输入样本计算四个混沌特征，计算复杂且耗时。

Method: 提出AutochaosNet及其简化变体（TM AutochaosNet和TM-FR AutochaosNet），利用Champernowne常数生成的通用混沌序列，通过输入刺激定义特征提取的时间界限。

Result: AutochaosNet在分类任务中表现优异或优于现有NL算法，同时显著减少训练时间和计算负担。

Conclusion: AutochaosNet是一种高效、可扩展的分类算法，未来研究将探索更多混沌映射以进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) is a brain-inspired classification framework that
employs chaotic dynamics to extract features from input data and yields state
of the art performance on classification tasks. However, NL requires the tuning
of multiple hyperparameters and computing of four chaotic features per input
sample. In this paper, we propose AutochaosNet - a novel, hyperparameter-free
variant of the NL algorithm that eliminates the need for both training and
parameter optimization. AutochaosNet leverages a universal chaotic sequence
derived from the Champernowne constant and uses the input stimulus to define
firing time bounds for feature extraction. Two simplified variants - TM
AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet - are evaluated against the existing NL
architecture - ChaosNet. Our results demonstrate that AutochaosNet achieves
competitive or superior classification performance while significantly reducing
training time due to reduced computational effort. In addition to eliminating
training and hyperparameter tuning, AutochaosNet exhibits excellent
generalisation capabilities, making it a scalable and efficient choice for
real-world classification tasks. Future work will focus on identifying
universal orbits under various chaotic maps and incorporating them into the NL
framework to further enhance performance.

TL;DR: 论文分析了WSD学习率调度器中冷却阶段的机制，揭示了冷却形状对模型性能的影响，并提出了优化建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷却阶段在Transformer训练中对性能至关重要，但其机制尚不明确，因此需要深入研究。

Method: 通过分析WSD调度器的冷却阶段，探讨不同冷却形状和AdamW超参数对模型性能的影响，并提供损失景观的可视化。

Result: 研究发现冷却形状的选择和AdamW超参数（如β₂）的调整对性能有显著影响，平衡探索与开发的形状表现最佳。

Conclusion: 优化冷却阶段配置对Transformer训练至关重要，应与传统超参数调优结合使用。

Abstract: Learning rate scheduling is essential in transformer training, where the
final annealing plays a crucial role in getting the best performance. However,
the mechanisms behind this cooldown phase, with its characteristic drop in
loss, remain poorly understood. To address this, we provide a comprehensive
analysis focusing solely on the cooldown phase in the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD)
learning rate scheduler. Our analysis reveals that different cooldown shapes
reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in the resulting models, with
shapes that balance exploration and exploitation consistently outperforming
alternatives. Similarly, we find substantial performance variations
$\unicode{x2013}$ comparable to those from cooldown shape selection
$\unicode{x2013}$ when tuning AdamW hyperparameters. Notably, we observe
consistent improvements with higher values of $\beta_2$ during cooldown. From a
loss landscape perspective, we provide visualizations of the landscape during
cooldown, supporting the river valley loss perspective empirically. These
findings offer practical recommendations for configuring the WSD scheduler in
transformer training, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the cooldown
phase alongside traditional hyperparameter tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自然语言指令的时间序列编辑方法InstructTime，解决了现有方法在条件格式和编辑强度控制上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的时间序列编辑方法依赖预定义的属性向量，条件格式不灵活且无法自定义编辑强度。

Method: 引入基于指令的时间序列编辑，通过多模态表示空间嵌入时间和指令，解码生成编辑后的时间序列，并采用多分辨率编码器处理局部和全局编辑。

Result: InstructTime在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，支持高质量、可控强度的编辑，并能泛化到未见过的指令和条件。

Conclusion: InstructTime是一种先进的、灵活的时间序列编辑方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time
series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital
patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it
impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing
diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as
conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute-
and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks
customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended
edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of
edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first
instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and
instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then
decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a
structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between
embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits
together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use
synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art
time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable
strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to
unseen conditions through few-shot learning.

Abstract: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is one of the most promising
techniques for designing efficient Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for
resource-constrained devices. Surrogate models play a crucial role in
hardware-aware NAS as they enable efficient prediction of performance
characteristics (e.g., inference latency and energy consumption) of different
candidate models on the target hardware device. In this paper, we focus on
building hardware-aware latency prediction models. We study different types of
surrogate models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We perform a
systematic analysis to understand the impact of different factors that can
influence the prediction accuracy of these models, aiming to assess the
importance of each stage involved in the model designing process and identify
methods and policies necessary for designing/training an effective estimation
model, specifically for GPU-powered devices. Based on the insights gained from
the analysis, we present a holistic framework that enables reliable dataset
generation and efficient model generation, considering the overall costs of
different stages of the model generation pipeline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashSVD是一种针对SVD压缩大型语言模型的新型端到端框架，通过融合低秩投影内核减少激活内存开销，实现峰值内存降低70.2%，且不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法主要关注模型权重的内存占用，忽略了推理时激活内存的开销，限制了实际部署的可行性。

Method: FlashSVD通过将低秩投影内核融合到自注意力和前馈网络管道中，避免生成全尺寸激活缓冲区，动态加载和计算小片截断因子。

Result: 在BERT-Base等基准测试中，FlashSVD将峰值激活内存降低70.2%，中间临时内存减少75%，且无准确性损失。

Conclusion: FlashSVD为低秩LLMs在内存受限环境中的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has recently seen a surge of interest as a
simple yet powerful tool for large language models (LLMs) compression, with a
growing number of works demonstrating 20-80% parameter reductions at minimal
accuracy loss. Previous SVD-based approaches have focused primarily on reducing
the memory footprint of model weights, largely overlooking the additional
activation memory overhead incurred during inference when applying truncated
factors via standard dense CUDA kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that this
activation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension,
prevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in
peak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world,
on-device deployments.
  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference
framework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models.
FlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based
methods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly
into both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD
avoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the
truncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the
fly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra
latency. On standard encoder benchmarks (e.g., BERT-Base), FlashSVD cuts peak
activation memory by up to 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75%, all
while incur no accuracy loss with upstreaming compression methods, offering a
practical path toward memory-constrained deployment of low-rank LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列具有强周期性，但现有深度学习模型因频谱偏差和缺乏频率感知先验而难以捕捉这些模式。

Method: 通过FFT引导的坐标下降提取低频分量，初始化正弦嵌入，并采用双速学习计划保持频率结构。

Result: 在多样化的真实基准测试中表现优异，尤其在长期预测中；合成数据中能准确恢复真实频率。

Conclusion: 将频谱先验注入深度时序模型可提升长期预测的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Many real-world time series exhibit strong periodic structures arising from
physical laws, human routines, or seasonal cycles. However, modern deep
forecasting models often fail to capture these recurring patterns due to
spectral bias and a lack of frequency-aware inductive priors. Motivated by this
gap, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances long-term
forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity through spectral initialization
and frequency-constrained optimization. Specifically, we extract dominant
low-frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-guided coordinate
descent, initialize sinusoidal embeddings with these components, and employ a
two-speed learning schedule to preserve meaningful frequency structure during
training. Our approach is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into
existing Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse
real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains--particularly at
long horizons--highlighting the benefits of injecting spectral priors into deep
temporal models for robust and interpretable long-range forecasting. Moreover,
on synthetic data, our method accurately recovers ground-truth frequencies,
further validating its interpretability and effectiveness in capturing latent
periodic patterns.

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework that builds on a
fine-tuned diffusion model and reward-directed sampling to generate
high-performance engineering designs. The framework adopts a parametric
representation of the design geometry and produces new parameter sets
corresponding to designs with enhanced performance metrics. A key advantage of
the reward-directed approach is its suitability for scenarios in which
performance metrics rely on costly engineering simulations or surrogate models
(e.g. graph-based, ensemble models, or tree-based) are non-differentiable or
prohibitively expensive to differentiate. This work introduces the iterative
use of a soft value function within a Markov decision process framework to
achieve reward-guided decoding in the diffusion model. By incorporating
soft-value guidance during both the training and inference phases, the proposed
approach reduces computational and memory costs to achieve high-reward designs,
even beyond the training data. Empirical results indicate that this iterative
reward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion
models to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and
enhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed
framework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution,
resulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and
over 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil
design. Successful integration of this model into the engineering design life
cycle can enhance both designer productivity and overall design performance.

Abstract: Over 22 million Americans participate in paddling-related activities
annually, contributing to a global paddlesports market valued at 2.4 billion US
dollars in 2020. Despite its popularity, the sport has seen limited integration
of machine learning (ML) and remains hindered by the cost of coaching and
specialized equipment. This study presents a novel AI-based coaching system
that uses ML models trained on motion data and delivers stroke feedback via a
large language model (LLM). Participants were recruited through a collaboration
with the NYU Concrete Canoe Team. Motion data were collected across two
sessions, one with suboptimal form and one with corrected technique, using
Apple Watches and smartphones secured in sport straps. The data underwent
stroke segmentation and feature extraction. ML models, including Support Vector
Classifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extremely Randomized Trees,
were trained on both raw and engineered features. A web based interface was
developed to visualize stroke quality and deliver LLM-based feedback. Across
four participants, eight trials yielded 66 stroke samples. The Extremely
Randomized Tree model achieved the highest performance with an F score of
0.9496 under five fold cross validation. The web interface successfully
provided both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. Sensor placement
near the wrists improved data quality. Preliminary results indicate that
smartwatches and smartphones can enable low cost, accessible alternatives to
traditional paddling instruction. While limited by sample size, the study
demonstrates the feasibility of using consumer devices and ML to support stroke
refinement and technique improvement.

Abstract: Indoor localization plays a pivotal role in supporting a wide array of
location-based services, including navigation, security, and context-aware
computing within intricate indoor environments. Despite considerable
advancements, deploying indoor localization systems in real-world scenarios
remains challenging, largely because of non-independent and identically
distributed (non-IID) data and device heterogeneity. In response, we propose
SimDeep, a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework explicitly crafted to
overcome these obstacles and effectively manage device heterogeneity. SimDeep
incorporates a Similarity Aggregation Strategy, which aggregates client model
updates based on data similarity, significantly alleviating the issues posed by
non-IID data. Our experimental evaluations indicate that SimDeep achieves an
impressive accuracy of 92.89%, surpassing traditional federated and centralized
techniques, thus underscoring its viability for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 原型模型支持从生理时间序列数据中进行可解释的数字表型分析，提供超越原始训练目标的临床有意义特征。

Abstract: Prototype-based neural networks offer interpretable predictions by comparing
inputs to learned, representative signal patterns anchored in training data.
While such models have shown promise in the classification of physiological
data, it remains unclear whether their prototypes capture an underlying
structure that aligns with broader clinical phenotypes. We use a
prototype-based deep learning model trained for multi-label ECG classification
using the PTB-XL dataset. Then without modification we performed inference on
the MIMIC-IV clinical database. We assess whether individual prototypes,
trained solely for classification, are associated with hospital discharge
diagnoses in the form of phecodes in this external population. Individual
prototypes demonstrate significantly stronger and more specific associations
with clinical outcomes compared to the classifier's class predictions,
NLP-extracted concepts, or broader prototype classes across all phecode
categories. Prototype classes with mixed significance patterns exhibit
significantly greater intra-class distances (p $<$ 0.0001), indicating the
model learned to differentiate clinically meaningful variations within
diagnostic categories. The prototypes achieve strong predictive performance
across diverse conditions, with AUCs ranging from 0.89 for atrial fibrillation
to 0.91 for heart failure, while also showing substantial signal for
non-cardiac conditions such as sepsis and renal disease. These findings suggest
that prototype-based models can support interpretable digital phenotyping from
physiologic time-series data, providing transferable intermediate phenotypes
that capture clinically meaningful physiologic signatures beyond their original
training objectives.

Result: 在100节点以内的图上表现优于无监督基线和经典启发式方法，具有跨规模和跨拓扑的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为ESPP问题提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: The Elementary Shortest-Path Problem(ESPP) seeks a minimum cost path from s
to t that visits each vertex at most once. The presence of negative-cost cycles
renders the problem NP-hard. We present a probabilistic method for finding
near-optimal ESPP, enabled by an unsupervised graph neural network that jointly
learns node value estimates and edge-selection probabilities via a surrogate
loss function. The loss provides a high probability certificate of finding
near-optimal ESPP solutions by simultaneously reducing negative-cost cycles and
embedding the desired algorithmic alignment. At inference time, a decoding
algorithm transforms the learned edge probabilities into an elementary path.
Experiments on graphs of up to 100 nodes show that the proposed method
surpasses both unsupervised baselines and classical heuristics, while
exhibiting high performance in cross-size and cross-topology generalization on

TL;DR: 论文提出KANMixer，一种基于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KAN）的新架构，用于长期时间序列预测（LTSF），并在多个基准数据集上实现最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多层感知机（MLP）的方法忽视了时间序列建模所需的层次局部性和序列归纳偏差，性能提升有限。KAN因其自适应基函数能力成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 引入KANMixer架构，结合多尺度混合主干，充分利用KAN的自适应能力。

Result: 在7个基准数据集的28个实验中，KANMixer在16个实验中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: KAN的自适应基函数显著改变了网络结构先验对预测性能的影响，为LTSF提供了新的建模核心。论文还总结了KAN在LTSF中的关键设计因素。

Abstract: In recent years, multilayer perceptrons (MLP)-based deep learning models have
demonstrated remarkable success in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF).
Existing approaches typically augment MLP backbones with hand-crafted external
modules to address the inherent limitations of their flat architectures.
Despite their success, these augmented methods neglect hierarchical locality
and sequential inductive biases essential for time-series modeling, and recent
studies indicate diminishing performance improvements. To overcome these
limitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed
model featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation
of nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new
modeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise
architecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages
KAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven
benchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we
systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison
with traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive
flexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the
influence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore,
we identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer
practical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF. Together, these
insights constitute the first empirically grounded guidelines for effectively
leveraging KAN in LTSF. Code is available in the supplementary file.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态聚类算法（DC-PFL）用于个性化联邦学习，通过模型差异度量数据异构性，优化聚类结构和通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据异构性导致的模型性能下降问题。

Method: 动态聚类算法基于模型差异度量数据异构性，利用训练损失曲线的快速下降期调整聚类结构，并采用分层聚合机制减少通信成本。

Result: 实验表明DC-PFL显著减少训练时间并提高模型准确性。

Conclusion: DC-PFL有效解决了数据异构性问题，提升了联邦学习的效率和性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a
global model, but it may not perform well when clients have high data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for
personalized federated learning system (DC-PFL) to address the problem of data
heterogeneity. DC-PFL starts with all clients training a global model and
gradually groups the clients into smaller clusters for model personalization
based on their data similarities. To address the challenge of estimating data
heterogeneity without exposing raw data, we introduce a discrepancy metric
called model discrepancy, which approximates data heterogeneity solely based on
the model weights received by the server. We demonstrate that model discrepancy
is strongly and positively correlated with data heterogeneity and can serve as
a reliable indicator of data heterogeneity. To determine when and how to change
grouping structures, we propose an algorithm based on the rapid decrease period
of the training loss curve. Moreover, we propose a layer-wise aggregation
mechanism that aggregates the low-discrepancy layers at a lower frequency to
reduce the amount of transmitted data and communication costs. We conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate our proposed algorithm,
and our results show that DC-PFL significantly reduces total training time and
improves model accuracy compared to baselines.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型依赖代理预测器，可能忽略关键设计缺陷，如浮动组件或边界不连续。

Result: 显著减少了失败模式，提高了设计真实性。

Conclusion: 该方法在自动化设计与专家判断之间架起桥梁，提供了可信赖的生成设计解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in denoising diffusion models have enabled rapid generation
of optimized structures for topology optimization. However, these models often
rely on surrogate predictors to enforce physical constraints, which may fail to
capture subtle yet critical design flaws such as floating components or
boundary discontinuities that are obvious to human experts. In this work, we
propose a novel human-in-the-loop diffusion framework that steers the
generative process using a lightweight reward model trained on minimal human
feedback. Inspired by preference alignment techniques in generative modeling,
our method learns to suppress unrealistic outputs by modulating the reverse
diffusion trajectory using gradients of human-aligned rewards. Specifically, we
collect binary human evaluations of generated topologies and train classifiers
to detect floating material and boundary violations. These reward models are
then integrated into the sampling loop of a pre-trained diffusion generator,
guiding it to produce designs that are not only structurally performant but
also physically plausible and manufacturable. Our approach is modular and
requires no retraining of the diffusion model. Preliminary results show
substantial reductions in failure modes and improved design realism across
diverse test conditions. This work bridges the gap between automated design
generation and expert judgment, offering a scalable solution to trustworthy
generative design.

Motivation: 解决多数据流学习中的异质性和概念漂移问题，现有方法假设流同质且架构静态，限制了复杂动态环境中的泛化能力。

Method: 为每个流分配独立系统和特征提取器，动态专家池捕获流特定模式，协作专家通过注意力机制整合上下文，AET策略动态管理专家生命周期。

Result: 实验表明CAMEL在多流学习中具有优越的泛化能力和对复杂概念漂移的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CAMEL通过动态协作和专家级可塑性，有效解决了多数据流学习中的异质性和概念漂移问题。

Abstract: Learning from multiple data streams in real-world scenarios is fundamentally
challenging due to intrinsic heterogeneity and unpredictable concept drifts.
Existing methods typically assume homogeneous streams and employ static
architectures with indiscriminate knowledge fusion, limiting generalizability
in complex dynamic environments. To tackle this gap, we propose CAMEL, a
dynamic \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}ssistance \textbf{M}ixture of
\textbf{E}xperts \textbf{L}earning framework. It addresses heterogeneity by
assigning each stream an independent system with a dedicated feature extractor
and task-specific head. Meanwhile, a dynamic pool of specialized private
experts captures stream-specific idiosyncratic patterns. Crucially,
collaboration across these heterogeneous streams is enabled by a dedicated
assistance expert. This expert employs a multi-head attention mechanism to
distill and integrate relevant context autonomously from all other concurrent
streams. It facilitates targeted knowledge transfer while inherently mitigating
negative transfer from irrelevant sources. Furthermore, we propose an
Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) strategy, which dynamically manages expert
lifecycles in response to drift. It instantiates new experts for emerging
concepts (freezing prior ones to prevent catastrophic forgetting) and prunes
obsolete ones. This expert-level plasticity provides a robust and efficient
mechanism for online model capacity adaptation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CAMEL's superior generalizability across diverse multistreams and
exceptional resilience against complex concept drifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习中因数据输入质量差或动作错误导致的决策问题，提升模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: ARL框架包含两个外部代理：实时评估器（识别并拒绝次优决策）和选择性反馈整理器（生成高质量训练数据集）。

Result: 实验表明，结合人类反馈显著提升了模型的决策能力和准确性，尤其在复杂或模糊环境中。

Conclusion: ARL框架结合机器效率和人类洞察力，为数据驱动应用提供了一种可扩展的模型性能提升方法。

Abstract: This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning
framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine
learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on
model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated
scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the
priority of the "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" problem that caused poor data inputs
or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates
two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality
data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time
evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model,
identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External
Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and
accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training
cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world
scenario, which is "Document Identification and Information Extraction". This
problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere.
The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done
correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback
significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness
and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of
machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly
in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that
human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a
scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出TCDiff框架，通过三阶段扩散网络生成高质量电子健康记录（EHR），解决现有方法在建模异构多模态数据、捕捉复杂依赖关系和处理数据缺失方面的不足，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模高质量EHR数据稀缺，尤其在传统中医（TCM）领域，现有方法难以处理异构多模态数据和数据缺失问题。

Method: 提出TCDiff框架，包含三阶段扩散网络：参考模态扩散、跨模态桥接和目标模态扩散。

Result: TCDiff在数据保真度上平均优于现有方法10%，同时保持隐私性。

Conclusion: TCDiff在真实医疗场景中表现出高效性、鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale and high-quality electronic health records (EHRs)
remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research, especially as large
foundation models become increasingly data-hungry. Synthesizing substantial
volumes of de-identified and high-fidelity data from existing datasets has
emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods suffer from a series
of limitations: they struggle to model the intrinsic properties of
heterogeneous multimodal EHR data (e.g., continuous, discrete, and textual
modalities), capture the complex dependencies among them, and robustly handle
pervasive data incompleteness. These challenges are particularly acute in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). To this end, we propose TCDiff (Triplex
Cascaded Diffusion Network), a novel EHR generation framework that cascades
three diffusion networks to learn the features of real-world EHR data,
formatting a multi-stage generative process: Reference Modalities Diffusion,
Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion. Furthermore, to validate
our proposed framework, besides two public datasets, we also construct and
introduce TCM-SZ1, a novel multimodal EHR dataset for benchmarking.
Experimental results show that TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 10% in data fidelity under various missing rate,
while maintaining competitive privacy guarantees. This highlights the
effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our approach in real-world
healthcare scenarios.

Result: IMU在视觉和语言任务中表现优于现有无需保留数据的机器遗忘方法。

Conclusion: IMU是一种简单有效的机器遗忘方法，显著提升遗忘效果并保持模型实用性。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks
and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about
privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU),
i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points
upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full
fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the
original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and
storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but
some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain
set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this
paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet
effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU
employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of
unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.
This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while
maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate
that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少内存使用并提升推理速度，性能损失极小。

Conclusion: EAC-MoE通过针对性的量化和剪枝策略，有效优化了MoE-LLMs的性能和效率。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated promising potential in scaling
LLMs. However, it is hindered by two critical challenges: (1) substantial GPU
memory consumption to load all experts; (2) low activated parameters cannot be
equivalently translated into inference acceleration effects. In this work, we
propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which
deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of
quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two
challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit
quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in
MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection
Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating
the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not
crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore,
we propose Pruning based on Expert-Selection Frequency (PESF), which
significantly improves inference speed by pruning less frequently used experts
for current task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal
performance degradation.

Motivation: 微服务架构的分布式特性带来了性能监控和资源管理的挑战，传统方法依赖的请求延迟指标对瞬时噪声敏感且无法全面反映复杂并发工作负载的行为。

Method: USRFNet利用GNN捕捉服务交互和请求传播模式，同时使用gMLP模块独立建模集群资源动态，最后将两种表示融合为统一系统嵌入以预测P95延迟。

Result: 在真实微服务基准测试中，USRFNet在大规模压力测试条件下显著优于现有基线方法，预测准确性大幅提升。

Conclusion: USRFNet通过分离和融合流量侧与资源侧特征，为微服务架构的性能监控提供了更稳定和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Microservice architectures have become the de facto standard for building
scalable cloud-native applications, yet their distributed nature introduces
significant challenges in performance monitoring and resource management.
Traditional approaches often rely on per-request latency metrics, which are
highly sensitive to transient noise and fail to reflect the holistic behavior
of complex, concurrent workloads. In contrast, window-level P95 tail latency
provides a stable and meaningful signal that captures both system-wide trends
and user-perceived performance degradation. We identify two key shortcomings in
existing methods: (i) inadequate handling of heterogeneous data, where
traffic-side features propagate across service dependencies and resource-side
signals reflect localized bottlenecks, and (ii) the lack of principled
architectural designs that effectively distinguish and integrate these
complementary modalities. To address these challenges, we propose USRFNet, a
deep learning network that explicitly separates and models traffic-side and
resource-side features. USRFNet employs GNNs to capture service interactions
and request propagation patterns, while gMLP modules independently model
cluster resource dynamics. These representations are then fused into a unified
system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy. We
evaluate USRFNet on real-world microservice benchmarks under large-scale stress
testing conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in prediction
accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 在BERT-base模型上实验表明，相比现有方法，速度提升高达8倍、9倍和22倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了安全推理的效率，同时保护了隐私。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in
privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services,
ensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party
computation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from
high communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the
expensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a
promising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision
integer computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing
MPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization
parameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in
handling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we
propose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight
fully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup
table protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we
use dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup
tables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on
BERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\times$
speedup compared to Lu \emph{et al}. (NDSS 25), $9\times$ speedup compared to
Gupta \emph{et al}. (PETS 24) and $22 \times$ speedup compared to Knott

Abstract: Current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) underutilize the temporal dynamics
inherent in spike-based processing, relying primarily on rate coding while
overlooking precise timing information that provides rich computational cues.
We propose SPARTA (Spiking Priority Attention with Resource-Adaptive Temporal

spike-timing information to enable efficient sparse attention. SPARTA
prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike
timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive
gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention
complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k << n, while maintaining high accuracy.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and
competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%), demonstrating
that exploiting spike timing dynamics improves both computational efficiency

Result: 实验表明，该方法在泛化准确率上优于现有异构框架，同时降低了通信成本和内存消耗。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了模型异构联邦学习的性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a pioneering machine learning paradigm that
enables distributed clients to process local data effectively while ensuring
data privacy. However, the efficacy of FL is usually impeded by the data
heterogeneity among clients, resulting in local models with low generalization
performance. To address this problem, traditional model-homogeneous approaches
mainly involve debiasing the local training procedures with regularization or
dynamically adjusting client weights in aggregation. Nonetheless, these
approaches become incompatible for scenarios where clients exhibit
heterogeneous model architectures. In this paper, we propose a
model-heterogeneous FL framework that can improve clients' generalization
performance over unseen data without model aggregation. Instead of model
parameters, clients exchange the feature distributions with the server,
including the mean and the covariance. Accordingly, clients train a variational
transposed convolutional (VTC) neural network with Gaussian latent variables
sampled from the feature distributions, and use the VTC model to generate
synthetic data. By fine-tuning local models with the synthetic data, clients
significantly increase their generalization performance. Experimental results
show that our approach obtains higher generalization accuracy than existing
model-heterogeneous FL frameworks, as well as lower communication costs and
memory consumption

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, traditional FL
suffers from communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and straggler
effects. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) addresses these by allowing
clients to update independently, improving scalability and reducing
synchronization delays. This paper extends AFL to handle non-convex objective
functions and heterogeneous datasets, common in modern deep learning. We
present a rigorous convergence analysis, deriving bounds on the expected
gradient norm and studying the effects of staleness, variance, and
heterogeneity. To mitigate stale updates, we introduce a staleness aware
aggregation that prioritizes fresher updates and a dynamic learning rate
schedule that adapts to client staleness and heterogeneity, improving stability
and convergence. Our framework accommodates variations in computational power,
data distribution, and communication delays, making it practical for real world
applications. We also analyze the impact of client selection
strategies-sampling with or without replacement-on variance and convergence.
Implemented in PyTorch with Python's asyncio, our approach is validated through
experiments demonstrating improved performance and scalability for
asynchronous, heterogeneous, and non-convex FL scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合标记化方法，将表格数据转换为适合LLM训练的序列格式，结合固定标记和BPE子词编码，应用于网络流量数据集，实现高效处理和压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习中表格数据表示的挑战，特别是适应序列架构（如Transformers和LLMs）的需求。

Method: 结合固定标记表示结构元素和低基数分类特征，使用BPE子词编码处理高基数和连续值。

Result: 在NetFlow数据集上高效处理3100万网络流，压缩比6.18:1，生成10亿标记的语料库。

Conclusion: 该方法为结构化数据训练基础模型提供了可行且通用的途径。

Abstract: Data representation remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning,
particularly when adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and
Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured tabular data. Existing methods
often fail to cohesively encode the mix of numerical and categorical features
or preserve the inherent structure of tables. This paper introduces a novel,
hybrid tokenisation methodology designed to convert tabular data into a
unified, sequential format suitable for LLM training. Our approach combines
predefined fixed tokens to represent structural elements and low-cardinality
categorical features, with a learned subword vocabulary using Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE) for high-cardinality and continuous values. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this technique by applying it to a large-scale NetFlow dataset
(CIDDS-001), preparing a corpus for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
foundation model. The evaluation shows that our method is highly efficient,
processing over 31 million network flows in under five hours and achieving a
significant data compression ratio of 6.18:1. This process resulted in a
computationally manageable corpus of over one billion tokens, establishing a
viable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured
data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHAR是一个将时间序列分类模型的特征归因转化为结构化、可读性强的规则的框架，提升模型透明度和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类模型的解释性差，高维输入空间难以理解，需要一种方法将数值特征归因转化为人类可读的规则。

Method: PHAR通过规则融合步骤（如加权选择和lasso优化）将特征归因转化为结构化规则，并提供可视化技术展示规则的特异性与泛化性权衡。

Result: PHAR在UCI数据集上表现优异，提升了时间序列分类任务的解释性、决策透明度和实用性。

Conclusion: PHAR通过生成结构化规则和解决解释冲突，显著提升了时间序列分类模型的透明度和实用性。

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification
remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and
the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc
Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature
attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into
structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals
that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model
transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as
Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving
broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets
using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing
key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures
each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both
explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization
techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived
rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect
of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights.
Comprehensive experiments on UCI datasets demonstrate that PHAR improves
interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS
classification tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in applications such as
fitness tracking, smart homes, and healthcare monitoring. Traditional HAR
systems often rely on single modalities, such as motion sensors or cameras,
limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents
FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances
HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and
accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert
Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a
Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across
modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder
only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive
experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance,
achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of
0.881. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal
fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning for building accurate and
robust HAR systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息神经网络策略迭代（PINN-PI）的框架，用于解决由二阶HJB方程控制的随机最优控制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决随机最优控制问题，扩展确定性PINN方法到随机场景，并提供理论支持。

Method: 在每次迭代中，通过最小化线性PDE的残差训练神经网络近似值函数，并利用L²误差控制和Lipschitz型界限量化误差传播。

Result: 在多个基准问题（如随机倒立摆、摆问题和高达10维的线性二次调节问题）上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PINN-PI框架在随机最优控制问题中表现出色，继承了经典策略迭代的全局指数收敛性。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI)
framework for solving stochastic optimal control problems governed by
second-order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations. At each iteration, a
neural network is trained to approximate the value function by minimizing the
residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy. This linear structure
enables systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, and
allows us to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that quantify how value
gradient errors propagate to the policy updates. This interpretability provides
a theoretical basis for evaluating policy quality during training. Our method
extends recent deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings,
inheriting the global exponential convergence guarantees of classical policy
iteration under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on several benchmark problems, including stochastic cartpole, pendulum problems
and high-dimensional linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in up to 10D.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，CcGAN-AVAR实现了最先进的生成质量和高效的采样。

Conclusion: CcGAN-AVAR在解决数据不平衡和计算效率问题上表现优异，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous
conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional
Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions
conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or
temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN
suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM
requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR,
an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the
GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling
bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel
components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism
that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that
constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density
ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across
eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves
state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

TL;DR: OccamVTS通过知识蒸馏从大型视觉模型中提取仅1%的关键参数，显著提升时间序列预测性能，同时减少过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现大型视觉模型99%的参数对时间序列任务不必要，且高层语义特征可能损害预测准确性。

Method: 提出OccamVTS框架，结合金字塔特征对齐和相关蒸馏，提取关键1%参数。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现最优性能，尤其在少样本和零样本场景表现突出。

Conclusion: 参数精简不仅提高效率，还能提升预测准确性，尤其适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent
approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns
through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance
forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time
series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with
low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair
forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework
that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into
lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS
employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature
distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic
noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves
accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while
preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters,
particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Motivation: 交互式大语言模型（LLMs）的爆炸性增长导致云GPU能耗激增，传统静态或基于规则的功耗管理策略无法在不影响性能的情况下实现节能。

Method: AGFT通过在线强化学习实时监测请求负载和延迟等特征，利用细粒度频率控制和智能动作空间剪枝，实现稳定高效的决策。

Result: 实验表明，AGFT在模拟真实波动请求的环境中节省了44.3%的GPU能耗，性能延迟仅增加不到10%，EDP优化达40.3%。

Conclusion: AGFT显著提升了LLM推理集群的能效和经济效益，且不影响服务质量。

Abstract: The explosive growth of interactive Large Language Models (LLMs) has placed
unprecedented demands for low latency on cloud GPUs, forcing them into
high-power modes and causing escalating energy costs. Real-time inference
workloads exhibit significant dynamic volatility, presenting substantial
energy-saving opportunities. However, traditional static or rule-based power
management strategies struggle to exploit these opportunities without
compromising peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose AGFT (An
Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner), a framework that employs online reinforcement
learning to autonomously learn an optimal frequency tuning policy. By
monitoring real-time features like request load and latency, AGFT utilizes
fine-grained frequency control for precise adjustments and intelligent action
space pruning for stable, efficient decision-making. This creates a robust,
automated energy management solution. We comprehensively evaluated AGFT in an
environment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The
experimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU
energy consumption while introducing a minimal performance latency overhead of
under 10%. This achievement translates into a comprehensive Energy-Delay
Product (EDP) optimization of up to 40.3%, clearly showing that our framework
can significantly enhance the energy efficiency and economic benefits of
existing LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.

Conclusion: FedDPQ首次从数据、计算和通信角度联合优化联邦学习性能，适用于不可靠无线网络。

Abstract: Emerging real-time computer vision (CV) applications on wireless edge devices
demand energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning. Federated learning
(FL) enables on-device training without raw data sharing, yet remains
challenging in resource-constrained environments due to energy-intensive
computation and communication, as well as limited and non-i.i.d. local data. We
propose FedDPQ, an ultra energy-efficient FL framework for real-time CV over
unreliable wireless networks. FedDPQ integrates diffusion-based data
augmentation, model pruning, communication quantization, and transmission power
control to enhance training efficiency. It expands local datasets using
synthetic data, reduces computation through pruning, compresses updates via
quantization, and mitigates transmission outages with adaptive power control.
We further derive a closed-form energy-convergence model capturing the coupled
impact of these components, and develop a Bayesian optimization(BO)-based
algorithm to jointly tune data augmentation strategy, pruning ratio,
quantization level, and power control. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to jointly optimize FL performance from the perspectives of
data, computation, and communication under unreliable wireless conditions.
Experiments on representative CV tasks show that FedDPQ achieves superior
convergence speed and energy efficiency.

Method: 引入评分网络评估扩散状态与未来协变量的语义对齐，通过重要性重加权逐步调整采样路径，不改变原始训练过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在预测准确性和协变量对齐方面均有提升，尤其在复杂条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: SemGuide是一种即插即用的推理时方法，适用于任何条件扩散框架，显著提升了语义对齐和预测性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in time series
forecasting, yet often suffer from semantic misalignment between generated
trajectories and conditioning covariates, especially under complex or
multimodal conditions. To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a
plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in
conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to
assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future
covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance
reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without
altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and
compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world
forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and
covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex
conditioning scenarios.

Result: 实验证明，TO方法在强凸和非凸优化任务中收敛更快，且在LLM微调中表现优异。

Conclusion: 可训练优化器（TO）在性能和效率上优于传统方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The concept of learning to optimize involves utilizing a trainable
optimization strategy rather than relying on manually defined full gradient
estimations such as ADAM. We present a framework that jointly trains the full
gradient estimator and the trainable weights of the model. Specifically, we
prove that pseudo-linear TO (Trainable Optimizer), a linear approximation of
the full gradient, matches SGD's convergence rate while effectively reducing
variance. Pseudo-linear TO incurs negligible computational overhead, requiring
only minimal additional tensor multiplications. To further improve
computational efficiency, we introduce two simplified variants of Pseudo-linear
TO. Experiments demonstrate that TO methods converge faster than benchmark
algorithms (e.g., ADAM) in both strongly convex and non-convex settings, and
fine tuning of an LLM.

Abstract: The routing problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are well-known combinatorial
optimization challenges with broad practical relevance. Recent data-driven
optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face
limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances.
In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference
Optimization (VAGPO) approach for solving the routing problems. By leveraging
ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO
captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that
significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient
methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed
VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits
strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without

Result: 实验表明，自适应策略能有效维持联邦学习的鲁棒性，即使未能精确重构缺失客户端的数据。

Conclusion: 论文讨论了局限性，并指出了未来解决客户端退出问题的研究方向。

Abstract: We consider the problem of persistent client dropout in asynchronous
Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL). Asynchronicity and decentralization
obfuscate information about model updates among federation peers, making
recovery from a client dropout difficult. Access to the number of learning
epochs, data distributions, and all the information necessary to precisely
reconstruct the missing neighbor's loss functions is limited. We show that
obvious mitigations do not adequately address the problem and introduce
adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction. We show that these
strategies can effectively recover some performance loss caused by dropout. Our
work focuses on asynchronous DFL with local regularization and differs
substantially from that in the existing literature. We evaluate the proposed
methods on tabular and image datasets, involve three DFL algorithms, and three
data heterogeneity scenarios (iid, non-iid, class-focused non-iid). Our
experiments show that the proposed adaptive strategies can be effective in
maintaining robustness of federated learning, even if they do not reconstruct
the missing client's data precisely. We also discuss the limitations and
identify future avenues for tackling the problem of client dropout.

Abstract: Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis,
such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond
discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward
continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the
underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,
extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the
dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably
under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as
the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics
solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories
toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To
achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and
(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain
rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to
process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to
extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.
During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future
trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal
current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon
optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions,
indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable
performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our
method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Result: 理论分析表明PCPO具有收敛性，实验显示其稳定性优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PCPO为约束下的策略优化提供了稳健解决方案，对未来研究和应用有重要意义。

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces significant issues such as
constraint violations and instability, necessitating the use of constrained
policy optimization, which seeks optimal policies while ensuring adherence to
specific constraints like safety. Typically, constrained optimization problems
are addressed by the Lagrangian method, a post-violation remedial approach that
may result in oscillations and overshoots. Motivated by this, we propose a
novel method named Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) that
incorporates a preemptive penalty mechanism. This mechanism integrates barrier
items into the objective function as the policy nears the boundary, imposing a
cost. Meanwhile, we introduce a constraint-aware intrinsic reward to guide
boundary-aware exploration, which is activated only when the policy approaches
the constraint boundary. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for
the duality gap and the performance of the PCPO update, shedding light on the
method's convergence characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the optimization
performance, we adopt a policy iteration approach. An interesting finding is
that PCPO demonstrates significant stability in experiments. Experimental
results indicate that the PCPO framework provides a robust solution for policy
optimization under constraints, with important implications for future research
and practical applications.

proposes a novel framework that integrates the Proximal Policy Optimization

### [150] [How Does Controllability Emerge In Language Models During Pretraining?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01892)
*Jianshu She,Xinyue Li,Eric Xing,Zhengzhong Liu,Qirong Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型内部表征的线性可操控性（linear steerability）在训练过程中的动态变化，提出了统一的干预检测框架（Intervention Detector, ID）来分析其演化规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对语言模型内部表征干预的有效条件尚不明确，通常依赖启发式和试错法验证。本文旨在填补这一空白，探究线性可操控性在训练过程中的动态变化。

Method: 提出统一的干预检测框架（ID），通过隐藏状态和表征分析揭示线性可操控性的演化规律，并引入基于ID的指标（如热图、熵趋势、余弦相似度）进行解释。

Result: 研究发现，线性可操控性在训练的中期阶段出现，且相关概念（如愤怒和悲伤）的可操控性出现时间不同；隐藏空间中概念的线性可分性增强与线性可操控性显著相关。

Conclusion: ID框架揭示了线性可操控性的动态演化规律，为理解语言模型内部表征的控制提供了新视角，且适用于不同模型家族。

Abstract: Language models can be steered by modifying their internal representations to
control concepts such as emotion, style, or truthfulness in generation.
However, the conditions for an effective intervention remain unclear and are
often validated through heuristics and trial-and-error. To fill this gap, we
demonstrate that intervention efficacy, measured by linear steerability (i.e.,
the ability to adjust output via linear transformations of hidden states),
emerges during intermediate stages of training. Moreover, even closely related
concepts (e.g., anger and sadness) exhibit steerability emergence at distinct
stages of training.
  To better interpret the dynamics of steerability during training, we adapt
existing intervention techniques into a unified framework, referred to as the
"Intervention Detector" (ID), which is designed to reveal how linear
steerability evolves over the course of training through hidden state and
representation analysis. ID reveals that concepts become increasingly linearly
separable in the hidden space as training progresses, which strongly correlates
with the emergence of linear steerability. We further introduce ID-based
metrics, such as heatmaps, entropy trends, and cosine similarity, to help
interpret how linear steerability evolves throughout training. In addition, we
apply ID across different model families to ensure the generality of our
findings on steerability dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在大型语言模型（LLM）持续预训练中，如何通过经验回放和梯度对齐解决数据分布偏移问题，并验证了这些方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM训练在新数据出现时需要重新训练，效率低下。持续预训练虽高效，但新数据可能导致性能下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 研究了经验回放和梯度对齐两种方法，并在Llama架构上进行了大规模实验，涉及1000亿token的多语言数据。

Result: 两种方法均能稳定学习且避免遗忘，梯度对齐首次在LLM预训练中证明有效。小规模回放比增加模型规模更高效。

Conclusion: 持续预训练中，经验回放和梯度对齐是有效方法，小规模回放比增加模型规模更高效。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on
massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes
available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual
pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining
from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution
shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this
paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this
distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay
and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the
Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100
billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and
gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This
conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and
diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness
of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose
an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues
experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible
compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay
rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a
more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more
compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of
replaying old examples.

Method: 使用邻居距离最小化（NDM）目标，无监督学习非基对齐的子空间。

Result: 定性分析显示子空间可解释性强，定量实验验证了子空间与GPT-2中已知电路的关联。

Conclusion: NDM为理解模型内部结构和构建电路提供了新视角，并展示了在2B模型中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of
mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the
representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent
are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it
possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way?
Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable
subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor
distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an
unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in
many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the
same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to
``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using
known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and
circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by
finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing.
Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding
model internals and building circuits.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了分布偏移问题，提升了GNN解释的鲁棒性和灵活性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a wide
range of graph-related learning tasks. However, explaining their predictions
remains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the
graphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most
existing methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight
important substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on
which GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients
and degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse
subgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation
framework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's
training data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during
explanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph
identification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large
explanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this
subgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and
non-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This
process is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative
refinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets
using different GNN backbones and explanation methods. Experimental results
show that our method consistently improves explanation quality and can be
flexibly integrated with different architectures.

Motivation: 在部分可观察环境中，强化学习面临非马尔可夫性观测的挑战，现有自动机表示仅关注基于奖励的非马尔可夫性，且计算成本高昂。

Method: 引入Transition Machines (TMs)补充Reward Machines (RMs)，提出DBMM统一两者，并开发DB-RPNI算法高效推断自动机。

Result: 实验显示，DB-RPNI比现有方法快三个数量级，并能推断出最小正确自动机。

Conclusion: DBMM和DB-RPNI为处理POMDPs中的非马尔可夫性问题提供了高效且统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are fundamental to
many real-world applications. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
success in fully observable domains, learning policies from traces in partially
observable environments remains challenging due to non-Markovian observations.
Inferring an automaton to handle the non-Markovianity is a proven effective
approach, but faces two limitations: 1) existing automaton representations
focus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem
formulations; 2) inference algorithms face enormous computational costs. For
the first limitation, we introduce Transition Machines (TMs) to complement
existing Reward Machines (RMs). To develop a unified inference algorithm for
both automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that
subsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata
learning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly
reductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques
and identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata.
Experimentally, our inference method achieves speedups of up to three orders of
magnitude over SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: 揭示了组合与特征复杂性学习的差异，为理解二阶方法和梯度适应在少样本学习中的作用提供了方向。

Abstract: Rapidly learning abstract concepts from limited examples is a hallmark of
human intelligence. This work investigates whether gradient-based meta-learning
can equip neural networks with inductive biases for efficient few-shot
acquisition of discrete concepts. We compare meta-learning methods against a
supervised learning baseline on Boolean tasks generated by a probabilistic
context-free grammar (PCFG). By systematically varying concept dimensionality
(number of features) and compositionality (depth of grammar recursion), we
identify regimes in which meta-learning robustly improves few-shot concept
learning. We find improved performance and sample efficiency by training a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) across concept spaces increasing in dimensional and
compositional complexity. We are able to show that meta-learners are much
better able to handle compositional complexity than featural complexity and
establish an empirical analysis demonstrating how featural complexity shapes
'concept basins' of the loss landscape, allowing curvature-aware optimization
to be more effective than first order methods. We see that we can robustly
increase generalization on complex concepts by increasing the number of
adaptation steps in meta-SGD, encouraging exploration of rougher loss basins.
Overall, this work highlights the intricacies of learning compositional versus
featural complexity in high dimensional concept spaces and provides a road to
understanding the role of 2nd order methods and extended gradient adaptation in
few-shot concept learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统混合整数规划（MIP）方法在大型电网中计算复杂度高，难以实际应用，需要一种高效替代方案。

Method: 采用两阶段神经架构：LGNN近似直流潮流，HeteroGNN预测断路器状态，并通过物理一致性损失强制满足基尔霍夫定律。

Result: 在1000个断路器的合成网络中，OptiGridML将功率输出提升18%，推理时间从小时级降至毫秒级。

Conclusion: 结构化、感知潮流的GNN在物理网络系统的组合优化中具有加速潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces OptiGridML, a machine learning framework for discrete
topology optimization in power grids. The task involves selecting substation
breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem
typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and
computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated
MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network
(LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a
heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and
physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these
components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on
synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves
power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing
inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the
potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial
optimization in physical networked systems.

TL;DR: Kron-LoRA是一种参数高效且表达能力强的适配器，通过Kronecker乘积和低秩分解减少参数，性能接近或优于标准LoRA适配器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模预训练语言模型在多任务微调中参数效率和表达能力的需求。

Method: 采用两阶段适配器：先通过Kronecker乘积分解线性更新，再对其中一个矩阵进行低秩压缩。

Result: 在DistilBERT和Mistral-7B上，Kron-LoRA以更少参数匹配或优于LoRA性能，且量化友好。

Conclusion: Kron-LoRA结合Kronecker结构、低秩压缩和量化友好性，为多任务适配提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands
adapters that are both parameter-efficient and highly expressive. We introduce
\textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a two-stage adapter that first factorizes each frozen
linear update as a Kronecker product \[ \Delta W = A \otimes B \] and then
compresses \[ B \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{B2}\times d_{B1}} \] via an \(r\)-rank LoRA
decomposition \(B \approx B_{1}B_{2}\). By leveraging \[ \mathrm{rank}(A
\otimes B) \;=\; \mathrm{rank}(A)\,\mathrm{rank}(B), \] Kron-LoRA retains the
expressivity of the update while using up to $4\!\times\!$ fewer parameters
than a standard rank-8 LoRA adapter. Its compact adapter matrices also quantize
to 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further
memory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT
and Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy,
ARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an
840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a
5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a
3-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy,
Kron-LoRA retains 55.18\% accuracy versus 53.17\% for LoRA-8-despite using only
one-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task
transfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression,
quantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis,
Kron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution
for multi-task adaptation of large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过PRMs提高推理质量，但计算开销大，尤其是在并行生成大量解时。

Method: 提出PRMs可作为部分奖励模型，利用中间步骤的分数预测最终输出质量，实现早期拒绝。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，推理FLOPs减少了1.4-9倍，且不影响最终性能。

Conclusion: 早期拒绝是提高LLMs推理计算效率的有效机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex
reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question
answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling
inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used
to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods
introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large
numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs
can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection
of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We
introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that
the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of
final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on
intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both
theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases
exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong
correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On
math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$
reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results
suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the
compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合LLM和结构化数据，显著提升了临床预测性能，为医疗预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and
improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured
data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific
information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available
information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In
the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial,
task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based
retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus
like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both
unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to
generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical
tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and
in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework
achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$,
respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with
positive rates ranging from approximately $4\%$ to $13\%$. Moreover, it
outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including
established risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of
the first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an
LLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with
structured data for improved clinical outcome prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMTS建模中，传统CPA方法因零填充导致计算开销大，而图模型难以捕捉全局相关性，因此需要改进。

Method: KAFNet结合预卷积模块、时间核聚合模块和频率线性注意力块，优化序列处理与相关性建模。

Result: 在多个IMTS数据集上，KAFNet性能最优，参数减少7.2倍，训练推理加速8.4倍。

Conclusion: 保留CPA并优化处理方式，KAFNet在IMTS预测中优于现有图模型。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling
and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain
challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely
adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby
alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its
dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when
numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent
graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local
message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations.
Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series
properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art
graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a
compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1)
Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2)
Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of
intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the
low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain.
Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves
state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter
reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.

Result: 在三个真实数据集和五种流行推荐模型上的实验表明，DLDA在目标项目推广和逃避检测方面优于现有攻击方法。

Conclusion: 现代推荐系统比之前认为的更脆弱，亟需更强大的防御机制。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are now fundamental to various online platforms,
but their dependence on user-contributed data leaves them vulnerable to
shilling attacks that can manipulate item rankings by injecting fake users.
Although widely studied, most existing attack models fail to meet two critical
objectives simultaneously: achieving strong adversarial promotion of target
items while maintaining realistic behavior to evade detection. As a result, the
true severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives
remains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present
DLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet
indistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target
promotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding
space, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively
synthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade
detection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes
variability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments
on three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that,
compared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion
while remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are
more vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for
more robust defenses.

Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer
has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance
across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer (ST)-based models
require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs,
thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address
these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic
learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models.
Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce
redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured
$\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP
method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced
spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF)
neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic
learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods
significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining
competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and
high-performing ST-based models.

Abstract: Modern auto-bidding systems are required to balance overall performance with
diverse advertiser goals and real-world constraints, reflecting the dynamic and
evolving needs of the industry. Recent advances in conditional generative
models, such as transformers and diffusers, have enabled direct trajectory
generation tailored to advertiser preferences, offering a promising alternative
to traditional Markov Decision Process-based methods. However, these generative
methods face significant challenges, such as the distribution shift between
offline and online environments, limited exploration of the action space, and
the necessity to meet constraints like marginal Cost-per-Mille (CPM) and Return
on Investment (ROI). To tackle these challenges, we propose GRAD (Generative
Reward-driven Ad-bidding with Mixture-of-Experts), a scalable foundation model
for auto-bidding that combines an Action-Mixture-of-Experts module for diverse
bidding action exploration with the Value Estimator of Causal Transformer for
constraint-aware optimization. Extensive offline and online experiments
demonstrate that GRAD significantly enhances platform revenue, highlighting its
effectiveness in addressing the evolving and diverse requirements of modern

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体强化学习的双模态驾驶员模型（Dual-DM），用于生成高测试价值的安全关键场景，显著提升了生成效率和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶测试中，背景车辆（BVs）的驾驶行为模型对生成安全关键场景至关重要。通过合作对抗驾驶特性，可以高效生成高价值测试场景。

Method: 使用多智能体强化学习（MARL）训练双模态驾驶员模型（Dual-DM），结合非对抗和对抗驾驶模式，并通过演化场景生成方法生成复杂多样的安全关键场景。

Result: Dual-DM在保持场景保真度（>85%相似度）和复杂度（提升32.35%和12.5%）的同时，生成效率显著提升（+195%），且场景多样性得到验证。

Conclusion: Dual-DM通过演化场景生成方法，显著提升了安全关键场景的生成性能，适用于自动驾驶测试。

Abstract: In the autonomous driving testing methods based on evolving scenarios, the
construction method of the driver model, which determines the driving maneuvers
of background vehicles (BVs) in the scenario, plays a critical role in
generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative
adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient
generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper,
a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and
generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and
adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous
simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong
interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation
method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of
fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without
performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world
scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two
baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of
generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two
baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the
diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms
of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve
the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving
scenario generation method.

TL;DR: LLMs的自我置信度和模型多样性可预测编码一致性，显著减少人工审核工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人类专家意见常不一致的领域，评估LLMs输出的可靠性具有挑战性。

Method: 分析5,680个编码决策，结合模型自我置信度和多样性（Shannon熵）预测一致性。

Result: 双信号模型解释一致性达97.9%，减少人工审核65%，跨领域验证效果显著。

Conclusion: 提出了一种可推广的证据标准，用于校准定性研究中的AI判断。

Abstract: LLMs enable qualitative coding at large scale, but assessing the reliability
of their output remains challenging in domains where human experts seldom
agree. Analysing 5,680 coding decisions from eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
ten thematic categories, we confirm that a model's mean self-confidence already
tracks inter-model agreement closely (Pearson r=0.82). Adding model
diversity-quantified as the normalised Shannon entropy of the panel's
votes-turns this single cue into a dual signal that explains agreement almost
completely (R^2=0.979). The confidence-diversity duo enables a three-tier
workflow that auto-accepts 35% of segments with <5% audit-detected error and
routes the remainder for targeted human review, cutting manual effort by up to
65%. Cross-domain replication on six public datasets spanning finance,
medicine, law and multilingual tasks confirms these gains (kappa improvements
of 0.20-0.78). Our results establish a generalisable, evidence-based criterion
for calibrating AI judgement in qualitative research.

Abstract: Graph unlearning is tailored for GNNs to handle widespread and various graph
structure unlearning requests, which remain largely unexplored. The GIF (graph
influence function) achieves validity under partial edge unlearning, but faces
challenges in dealing with more disturbing node unlearning. To avoid the
overhead of retraining and realize the model utility of unlearning, we proposed
a novel node unlearning method to reverse the process of aggregation in GNN by
embedding reconstruction and to adopt Range-Null Space Decomposition for the
nodes' interaction learning. Experimental results on multiple representative
datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance of our proposed approach.

Result: 在真实数据集上，Epi$^2$-Net优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Epi$^2$-Net为未来流行病防控提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Advancing epidemic dynamics forecasting is vital for targeted interventions
and safeguarding public health. Current approaches mainly fall into two
categories: mechanism-based and data-driven models. Mechanism-based models are
constrained by predefined compartmental structures and oversimplified system
assumptions, limiting their ability to model complex real-world dynamics, while
data-driven models focus solely on intrinsic data dependencies without physical
or epidemiological constraints, risking biased or misleading representations.
Although recent studies have attempted to integrate epidemiological knowledge
into neural architectures, most of them fail to reconcile explicit physical
priors with neural representations. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce
Epi$^2$-Net, a Epidemic Forecasting Framework built upon Physics-Inspired
Neural Networks. Specifically, we propose reconceptualizing epidemic
transmission from the physical transport perspective, introducing the concept
of neural epidemic transport. Further, we present a physic-inspired deep
learning framework, and integrate physical constraints with neural modules to
model spatio-temporal patterns of epidemic dynamics. Experiments on real-world
datasets have demonstrated that Epi$^2$-Net outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in epidemic forecasting, providing a promising solution for future
epidemic containment. The code is available at:

Method: 两阶段框架：Mol-SFT（基于GPT-4o生成合成CoT样本）和Mol-RL（强化学习对齐化学结构与语言描述）。

Result: 显著提升模型的可解释性和分子理解能力，实验表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MolReasoner实现了从记忆到化学推理的转变，为分子推理领域提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain
insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on
general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics,
while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with
interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce
MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from
memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which
initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT)
samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently,
Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions
designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions,
thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably
enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and
enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from
memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.

Conclusion: 该研究为高效的时空建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of
biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities
of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate
time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly
integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for
multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time
features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph
structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation
(OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA)
hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers,
enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for
floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF)
Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a
spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking
self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence
datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art
SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal
models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient
spatial-temporal modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL) 是一种改进的低秩适应（LoRA）框架，通过引入多种正则化方法，有效减少大语言模型微调时的对齐漂移，提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA 在微调大语言模型时可能导致对齐漂移，削弱安全性和行为约束，因此需要一种方法在微调过程中保持对齐。

Method: AGL 结合了主任务损失、Fisher 信息矩阵正则化、任务特定正则化和碰撞感知正则化（包括黎曼重叠和测地分离），并通过 DriftCaps 基准量化对齐漂移。

Result: 实验表明，AGL 在安全关键基准上减少对齐漂移达 50%，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: AGL 是一种结构化的 LoRA 改进方法，能有效保持对齐，同时开源实现以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard tool for efficiently
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Yet, even minor LoRA updates can
induce alignment drift, weakening safety and behavioral constraints through
entangled parameter changes. To address this, we propose AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL),
a principled framework for preserving alignment during finetuning. AGL
introduces several key components: a primary task loss for supervision, Fisher
Information Matrix-based regularization to restrict updates in
alignment-sensitive subspaces, and task-specific regularization to stabilize
the integration of new knowledge. We further introduce collision-aware
regularization, blending Riemannian overlap -- which penalizes coordinate-wise
interference -- and geodesic separation -- which encourages disjoint update
geometry. We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and
unsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation.
Empirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on
safety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance.
Comprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to
preserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling
law for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning
loss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally
grounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal
trade-offs. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source
our implementation.

Conclusion: 几何框架为机器学习模型的解释和优化提供了新的理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for analyzing machine learning
  models through the geometry of their induced partitions. By representing
  partitions as Riemannian simplicial complexes, we capture not only adjacency
  relationships but also geometric properties including cell volumes, volumes
of
  faces where cells meet, and dihedral angles between adjacent cells. For
neural
  networks, we introduce a differential forms approach that tracks geometric
  structure through layers via pullback operations, making computations
  tractable by focusing on data-containing cells. The framework enables
  geometric regularization that directly penalizes problematic spatial
  configurations and provides new tools for model refinement through extended
  Laplacians and simplicial splines. We also explore how data distribution
  induces effective geometric curvature in model partitions, developing
discrete
  curvature measures for vertices that quantify local geometric complexity and
  statistical Ricci curvature for edges that captures pairwise relationships
  between cells. While focused on mathematical foundations, this geometric
  perspective offers new approaches to model interpretation, regularization,
and
  diagnostic tools for understanding learning dynamics.

Motivation: ANNS算法对AI应用（如RAG和基于代理的LLM）至关重要，但传统方法需要大量人工优化。CRINN旨在通过强化学习自动化这一过程。

Conclusion: CRINN的成功表明，结合强化学习的LLM可以自动化复杂算法优化，减少人工干预。

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become
increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this
paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS
optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves
as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of
progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy
constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness
across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against
state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance
on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and
GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean
and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond
ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning
can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic
optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual
refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

Method: 使用LSTM预测合并冲突风险，并与概率风险、50%和85%分位间隙基线方法对比。

Result: LSTM方法显著降低TET和TIT值，支持动态合并而非完全停车。

Conclusion: LSTM方法提升大型卡车工作区合并安全性，优于传统策略。

Abstract: Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily
due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large
trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures
caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of
large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated
with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging
based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into
a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is
critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a
minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free
merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in
response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is
compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based
merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based
merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower
conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and
Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can
perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete
stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly
observed with the baseline approaches.

Conclusion: 该研究为激活稀疏领域开辟了新方向，为下一代AI系统的算法与架构协同设计提供了基础。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), N:M sparsity has emerged as a
structured compression technique critical for accelerating inference. While
prior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from
significant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is
typically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address
these limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation
sparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the
acceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber
Pruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear
computations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality
and efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that
integrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach
preserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable
advantages in generative tasks. This work pioneers a new frontier in activation
sparsity, providing foundational insights that are poised to guide the
co-evolution of algorithms and architectures in the design of next-generation
AI systems.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather
events, presenting unprecedented challenges to the agricultural industry
worldwide. In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand.
We propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events,
specifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit
harvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant
impacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate
monitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an
unsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded
extreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals
considerable variability in how different types of extreme event affect
kiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes
and individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights
critical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in
accurately identifying events such as frost. These findings emphasise the need
for integrating supplementary features like farm management strategies with
climate adaptation practices. Our further investigation will employ ensemble
methods that consolidate nearby farms' yield data and regional climate station
features to reduce variance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of
extreme event detection and the formulation of response strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于线性代数的防御方法（FedLAD），用于抵御联邦学习中的Sybil攻击，特别是目标数据投毒攻击。该方法通过线性代数优化识别恶意节点，实验证明其优于现有防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sybil攻击（尤其是目标数据投毒）对联邦学习构成严重威胁，现有方法在恶意节点占多数时效果不佳，因此需要更有效的防御手段。

Method: FedLAD将联邦学习的聚合过程建模为线性问题，通过提取独立线性组合来过滤恶意节点。

Result: 实验表明，FedLAD在恶意节点比例为0.2至0.8时保持低攻击成功率，且在0.2至0.5时保持高模型准确性，优于五种基线方法。

Conclusion: FedLAD能有效提升联邦学习系统在数据投毒攻击下的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to federated learning, as malicious
nodes can collaborate and gain a majority, thereby overwhelming the system.
Therefore, it is essential to develop countermeasures that ensure the security
of federated learning environments. We present a novel defence method against
targeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called
Linear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as
clustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious
nodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a
linear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.
This method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear
combinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out
redundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established
defence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks
from both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments
confirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application
settings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated
learning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to
baseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for
malicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it
preserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and
0.5. These findings underscore FedLAD's potential to enhance both the
reliability and performance of federated learning systems in the face of data
poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: AuroBind为结构功能学习和高通量分子筛选提供了通用框架，填补了结构预测与药物发现之间的空白。

Abstract: Most human proteins remain undrugged, over 96% of human proteins remain
unexploited by approved therapeutics. While structure-based virtual screening
promises to expand the druggable proteome, existing methods lack atomic-level
precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting translational impact.
We present AuroBind, a scalable virtual screening framework that fine-tunes a
custom atomic-level structural model on million-scale chemogenomic data.
AuroBind integrates direct preference optimization, self-distillation from
high-confidence complexes, and a teacher-student acceleration strategy to
jointly predict ligand-bound structures and binding fitness. The proposed
models outperform state-of-the-art models on structural and functional
benchmarks while enabling 100,000-fold faster screening across ultra-large
compound libraries. In a prospective screen across ten disease-relevant
targets, AuroBind achieved experimental hit rates of 7-69%, with top compounds
reaching sub-nanomolar to picomolar potency. For the orphan GPCRs GPR151 and
GPR160, AuroBind identified both agonists and antagonists with success rates of
16-30%, and functional assays confirmed GPR160 modulation in liver and prostate
cancer models. AuroBind offers a generalizable framework for structure-function
learning and high-throughput molecular screening, bridging the gap between

Conclusion: 特权信息的理论和方法创新为安全强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Partial observability presents a significant challenge for safe reinforcement
learning, as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards.
Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate
the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes.
In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov
Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of
incorporating privileged information. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the
Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, a model-based safe reinforcement
learning approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's
safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an
asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of safety and
task-centric performance. Meanwhile, compared to alternative privileged
model-based reinforcement learning methods, our approach exhibits superior
performance and ease of training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MLP、MSCNN和CA的轨迹预测模型，通过融合全局和局部时间信息，显著降低了预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨迹预测对用户移动性预判和提前准备至关重要，但轨迹数据的全局和局部时间信息复杂，且用户行为时间尺度多样，增加了预测难度。

Method: 使用MLP提取全局时间信息，MSCNN提取局部时间信息，并通过CA融合两者。MSCNN采用多尺度卷积核以适应不同行为模式。

Result: 在12步预测中，模型比ModernTCN降低了MSE 5.04%和MAE 4.35%，同时保持相似的推理时间。

Conclusion: 该模型通过多尺度信息融合，有效提升了轨迹预测的准确性。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that
anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to
reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable
inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data
contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the
extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs
over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral
patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on
multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN),
and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the
global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to
extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features
within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are
used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions,
enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally,
CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information. Experimental
results show that our model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 5.04% and mean
absolute error (MAE) by 4.35% compared with ModernTCN in 12-step prediction,
while maintaining similar inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个人贷款平台需要优化信用额度、利率和贷款期限以管理风险和客户价值，但现有因果方法难以处理连续多维处理且缺乏领域知识约束。

Method: 提出Multi-Treatment-DML框架，结合双机器学习（DML）进行观测数据去偏、处理多维连续处理，并强制单调约束以满足金融领域需求。

Result: 在公共基准和实际工业数据集上验证了框架的有效性，并通过在线A/B测试证实其在真实贷款运营中的优越性。

Conclusion: Multi-Treatment-DML为连续多维处理的因果估计提供了有效解决方案，适用于金融领域的实际应用。

Abstract: Optimizing credit limits, interest rates, and loan terms is crucial for
managing borrower risk and lifetime value (LTV) in personal loan platform.
However, counterfactual estimation of these continuous, multi-dimensional
treatments faces significant challenges: randomized trials are often prohibited
by risk controls and long repayment cycles, forcing reliance on biased
observational data. Existing causal methods primarily handle binary/discrete
treatments and struggle with continuous, multi-dimensional settings.
Furthermore, financial domain knowledge mandates provably monotonic
treatment-outcome relationships (e.g., risk increases with credit limit).To
address these gaps, we propose Multi-Treatment-DML, a novel framework
leveraging Double Machine Learning (DML) to: (i) debias observational data for
causal effect estimation; (ii) handle arbitrary-dimensional continuous
treatments; and (iii) enforce monotonic constraints between treatments and
outcomes, guaranteeing adherence to domain requirements.Extensive experiments
on public benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B testing conducted on a
realworld personal loan platform, confirms the practical superiority of
Multi-Treatment-DML in real-world loan operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型生成文本的真实性问题，避免传统方法对大量数据和计算资源的需求。

Method: 利用少量标注数据构建参考空间，通过检索相似上下文并聚合其对数概率来调整模型输出。

Result: 在三个问答基准测试中表现优异，TruthfulQA提升2.8%，且具有跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练模型，高效且可扩展，为提升语言模型真实性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ensuring truthfulness in large language models remains a critical challenge
for reliable text generation. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning with human feedback have shown promise, they require substantial
amount of annotated data and computational resources, limiting scalability. In
contrast, decoding-time interventions offer lightweight alternatives without
model retraining. However, existing decoding strategies often face issues like
prompt sensitivity, limited generalization, or dependence on internal model
states. We propose a context-aware adaptive decoding method that leverages a
compact reference grounding space, built from as few as 10 annotated examples
and comprising pairs of context embeddings and next token logits from truthful
responses, to enable retrieval-based logit shaping during inference. At each
decoding step, our method retrieves top-N semantically similar contexts and
aggregates their associated next token logits to modify the LLM's logits.
Across three open-ended question-answering benchmarks, our approach achieves a
2.8 percent average improvement on TruthfulQA and further outperforms existing
baselines on both Biographies and WikiQA. Experimental results also demonstrate
cross-task generalization, with TruthfulQA-derived grounding enhancing
biography generation. Our model-agnostic, scalable, and efficient method
requires only a single generation pass, highlighting the potential of
context-aware decoding for factual reliability in LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在训练数据、计算资源和能耗方面的高需求限制了其实际部署，因此需要探索更高效的替代方案。

Method: 设计了一个由多个用户、中央任务处理器和主题专业LLM集群组成的网络化LLM系统，通过路由用户查询并聚合多个LLM的响应来优化结果。

Result: 模拟实验表明，聚合响应比单个LLM的响应具有更高的准确性，尤其是在参与LLM性能相近时效果更显著。

Conclusion: 网络化LLM系统通过聚合小型专业模型的输出，能够有效平衡准确性和及时性，为LLM的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many
fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text
mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for
training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant
challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to
leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to
improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM
system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of
topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false)
queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$
LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final
aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy
and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization
problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations
demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy
than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant
when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多策略方法依赖在线强化学习和进化框架，导致样本效率低和交互成本高。

Result: 在七个连续动作机器人控制任务中，MPFT表现出更高的超体积性能，显著减少了交互和硬件需求。

Conclusion: MPFT框架在效率和性能上优于现有方法，适用于在线和离线多目标强化学习。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) plays a pivotal role in
addressing multi-criteria decision-making problems in the real world. The
multi-policy (MP) based methods are widely used to obtain high-quality Pareto
front approximation for the MORL problems. However, traditional MP methods only
rely on the online reinforcement learning (RL) and adopt the evolutionary
framework with a large policy population. This may lead to sample inefficiency
and/or overwhelmed agent-environment interactions in practice. By forsaking the
evolutionary framework, we propose the novel Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking
(MPFT) framework without maintaining any policy population, where both online
and offline MORL algorithms can be applied. The proposed MPFT framework
includes four stages: Stage 1 approximates all the Pareto-vertex policies,
whose mapping to the objective space fall on the vertices of the Pareto front.
Stage 2 designs the new Pareto tracking mechanism to track the Pareto front,
starting from each of the Pareto-vertex policies. Stage 3 identifies the sparse
regions in the tracked Pareto front, and introduces a new objective weight
adjustment method to fill the sparse regions. Finally, by combining all the
policies tracked in Stages 2 and 3, Stage 4 approximates the Pareto front.
Experiments are conducted on seven different continuous-action robotic control
tasks with both online and offline MORL algorithms, and demonstrate the
superior hypervolume performance of our proposed MPFT approach over the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, with significantly reduced agent-environment
interactions and hardware requirements.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的通用最短路径搜索框架，通过构建骨架图和SGNN学习节点嵌入，结合LSearch和HLSearch算法，实现了高效且灵活的路径搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如Dijkstra和A*）在复杂图中效率低下，而基于索引的方法需要大量预处理和存储。学习型方法通常局限于特定领域，缺乏通用性。

Method: 构建骨架图捕获多级距离和跳数信息，使用SGNN学习节点嵌入并预测距离和跳数。结合LSearch（模型驱动剪枝）和HLSearch（分层训练）算法。

Result: 在五种真实世界图上验证，框架表现优异，适用于多种图类型。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于学习的最短路径搜索提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet
existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as
Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while
index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage.
Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on
context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general
applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest
path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At
the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures
multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph
Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and
predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support
LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the
search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a
hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with
individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of
our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on
five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong
performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for
learning-based shortest path search.

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of
artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as
responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously
building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the
complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the
need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we
introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework
that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly
into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given
only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge
outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training
virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:
Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature
retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop
optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated
generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts
with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to
collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.
We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,
using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and
cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently
outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge
demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing
perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling
challenge. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: In insurance fraud prediction, handling class imbalance remains a critical
challenge. This paper presents a novel multistage focal loss function designed
to enhance the performance of machine learning models in such imbalanced
settings by helping to escape local minima and converge to a good solution.
Building upon the foundation of the standard focal loss, our proposed approach
introduces a dynamic, multi-stage convex and nonconvex mechanism that
progressively adjusts the focus on hard-to-classify samples across training
epochs. This strategic refinement facilitates more stable learning and improved
discrimination between fraudulent and legitimate cases. Through extensive
experimentation on a real-world insurance dataset, our method achieved better
performance than the traditional focal loss, as measured by accuracy,
precision, F1-score, recall and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics on the auto
insurance dataset. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the multistage
focal loss in boosting model robustness and predictive accuracy in highly
skewed classification tasks, offering significant implications for fraud
detection systems in the insurance industry. An explainable model is included
to interpret the results.

Conclusion: FAIR-Pruner提供了一种高效、自动化的剪枝方法，适用于不同剪枝比例，无需微调即可实现高性能。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a critical compression technique that facilitates
the deployment of large-scale neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices, typically by identifying and eliminating redundant or insignificant
parameters to reduce computational and memory overhead. This paper proposes the
Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for
neural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates
the importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization
Score quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance
degradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,
which is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,
FAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model
performance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures
differences between unimportant units and those that cause performance
degradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to
automatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more
efficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate.
Another advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without
post-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and
reconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different
pruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark
datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG)
demonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while
maintaining high accuracy.

Result: 基于Transformer的生成器在预测性能上接近真实数据（94-97%），并保留了特征重要性模式。研究还发现，仅使用预定信息时，预测准确性存在固有局限。

Conclusion: 高质量合成数据可在保护商业机密的同时支持航空分析，但需对预战术预测准确性保持现实预期。

Abstract: Access to comprehensive flight operations data remains severely restricted in
aviation due to commercial sensitivity and competitive considerations,
hindering the development of predictive models for operational planning. This
paper investigates whether synthetic data can effectively replace real
operational data for training machine learning models in pre-tactical aviation
scenarios-predictions made hours to days before operations using only scheduled
flight information. We evaluate four state-of-the-art synthetic data generators
on three prediction tasks: aircraft turnaround time, departure delays, and
arrival delays. Using a Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) methodology on
over 1.7 million European flight records, we first validate synthetic data
quality through fidelity assessments, then assess both predictive performance
and the preservation of operational relationships. Our results show that
advanced neural network architectures, specifically transformer-based
generators, can retain 94-97% of real-data predictive performance while
maintaining feature importance patterns informative for operational
decision-making. Our analysis reveals that even with real data, prediction
accuracy is inherently limited when only scheduled information is
available-establishing realistic baselines for pre-tactical forecasting. These
findings suggest that high-quality synthetic data can enable broader access to
aviation analytics capabilities while preserving commercial confidentiality,
though stakeholders must maintain realistic expectations about pre-tactical
prediction accuracy given the stochastic nature of flight operations.

Result: 在多个数学基准和跨领域基准上，CAPO表现优于监督学习和基于RL的微调方法。

Conclusion: CAPO通过细粒度信用分配和投票机制，显著提升了强化学习的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary
feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods
typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to
every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,
making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or
failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.
Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often
yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other
hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments
for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision
labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning
(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method
Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response
rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,
general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to
generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable
token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned
identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment
in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of
CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated
critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen
models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms
supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six
challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.

Motivation: 边缘设备上的DNN训练面临数据集大导致的能耗高和泛化问题，现有方法存在DNN依赖和DDR访问能耗高的缺陷。

Method: 提出DE-SNE算法（DNN-free样本选择）并结合近内存计算技术，构建NMS系统，减少DDR访问和能耗。

Result: NMS在模型准确性上优于现有方法（DQ、DQAS、NeSSA），并显著降低DDR能耗。

Conclusion: NMS是首个DNN-free近内存采样技术，有效解决泛化问题和DDR能耗问题，适用于边缘设备。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing
attention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain
adaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large
datasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making
the training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have
been proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and
dataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating
representative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two
significant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate
the quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive
bias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training
images require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,
leading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by
the nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a
DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the
generalization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory
computing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images
need to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR
energy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system
with a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge
devices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free
near-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization
issues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The
experimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.

compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01',
`10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to
form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data
are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic
statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The
predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed
representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its
respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems,
symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the
proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning
algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer
Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8317 etc.). Rather than aiming for
state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the
classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression,
which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information
processing.

*Väinö Yrjänäinen,Isac Boström,Måns Magnusson,Johan Jonasson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可扩展的Gibbs采样器，用于量化词嵌入的不确定性，解决了现有方法计算不可行或假设限制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化词嵌入的不确定性对于文本数据的可靠推断至关重要，但现有方法如HMC和MFVI要么计算不可行，要么依赖限制性假设。

Method: 提出了一种基于Polya-Gamma增强和Laplace近似的可扩展Gibbs采样器，并与MFVI和HMC进行了比较。

Result: Gibbs采样器和HMC能正确估计不确定性，而MFVI不能，Laplace近似仅在大样本量下有效。后验均值在小样本量下优于MAP估计。

Conclusion: 后验采样在词嵌入中具有重要性，尤其是在小样本量下，Gibbs采样器在真实数据集上展示了可行性。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in word embeddings is crucial for reliable inference
from textual data. However, existing Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) and mean-field variational inference (MFVI) are either
computationally infeasible for large data or rely on restrictive assumptions.
  We propose a scalable Gibbs sampler using Polya-Gamma augmentation as well as
Laplace approximation and compare them with MFVI and HMC for word embeddings.
In addition, we address non-identifiability in word embeddings. Our Gibbs
sampler and HMC correctly estimate uncertainties, while MFVI does not, and
Laplace approximation only does so on large sample sizes, as expected. Applying
the Gibbs sampler to the US Congress and the Movielens datasets, we demonstrate
the feasibility on larger real data. Finally, as a result of having draws from
the full posterior, we show that the posterior mean of word embeddings improves
over maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in terms of hold-out likelihood,
especially for smaller sampling sizes, further strengthening the need for
posterior sampling of word embeddings.

TL;DR: MicroMix是一种混合精度量化算法和矩阵乘法内核，专为Blackwell架构设计，支持MXFP4、MXFP6和MXFP8通道，在多种任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INT4内核无法充分利用NVIDIA Blackwell架构的FP4 Tensor Cores性能，需设计匹配的量化算法和内核。

Method: 提出MicroMix算法和内核，支持混合精度通道，并引入量化阈值以平衡精度和效率。

Result: 在多种任务中表现优于TensorRT-FP8，执行速度提升至少20%，并改善预填充延迟和内存效率。

Conclusion: MicroMix在Blackwell架构上实现了高效的混合精度量化，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models
(LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision
counterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily
focused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although
the new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x
speedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this
capability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose
MicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix
multiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the
Blackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of
MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a
favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we
introduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where
lower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.
Our algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve
accuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or
superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and
few-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical
reasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX
5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than
TensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,
MicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a
range of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的切片技术用于Gromov-Wasserstein（GW）和融合扩展（FGW）距离，通过下界、分层最优传输和合适的积分规则，显著降低计算负担，同时保持等距不变性和几何比较能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GW和FGW距离在比较异构数据时具有强大能力，但计算复杂且受限于欧几里得几何，切片版本失去等距不变性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于下界、分层最优传输和1D最优传输问题的积分规则，提出新的切片技术。

Result: 新切片FGW显著减少计算量，保持等距不变性，适用于任意几何，并定义了一个伪度量。

Conclusion: 新切片距离在数值上更稳健可靠，适用于形状检索和图同构测试，优于原始GW和FGW距离。

Abstract: The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are
powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however,
challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal
transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been
proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version
is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries,
strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an
appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the
underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the
numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and
allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance
actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from
below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW.
Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is
numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance;
especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.

Method: 通过LLM生成高层交易策略来指导RL代理的行动，并评估LLM生成策略的合理性和LLM引导代理的性能指标（如夏普比率和最大回撤）。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM引导的代理在收益和风险指标上优于未引导的基准RL方法。

Conclusion: 结合LLM和RL的混合系统能够有效提升算法交易的策略质量和性能。

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term decisions aligned with long-term
financial goals. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for such
tactical decisions, its adoption remains limited by myopic behavior and opaque
policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently
demonstrated strategic reasoning and multi-modal financial signal
interpretation when guided by well-designed prompts.
  We propose a hybrid system where LLMs generate high-level trading strategies
to guide RL agents in their actions. We evaluate (i) the rationale of
LLM-generated strategies via expert review, and (ii) the Sharpe Ratio (SR) and
Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of LLM-guided agents versus unguided baselines. Results
show improved return and risk metrics over standard RL.

Conclusion: PPF高效解决了动态剪枝和手动设计依赖问题，显著提升了剪枝性能和速度。

Abstract: Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large
Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering
lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing
non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,
layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt
to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical
bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further
limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning
policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning
Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design
dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports
real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable
to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and
real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can
evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative
optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can
generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to
33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,
outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor
achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction
error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1
minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52
second), achieving over 64 times speedup. Our code will be available at

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验表明，GEFRFE能捕获更丰富的结构特征，显著提升分类性能，同时保持与GEFFE相当的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: GEFRFE通过引入分数域信息，有效提升了图表示学习的表现力和实用性。

Abstract: Spectral graph embedding plays a critical role in graph representation
learning by generating low-dimensional vector representations from graph
spectral information. However, the embedding space of traditional spectral
embedding methods often exhibit limited expressiveness, failing to exhaustively
capture latent structural features across alternative transform domains. To
address this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the
existing state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE)
into fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering
embedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph
fractional domain. The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a
nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized
graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel
strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based
adaptive learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly enhance
classification performance. Notably, the proposed method retains computational
complexity comparable to GEFFE approaches.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural
networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust
loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,
particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the
underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric
condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the
softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error
$\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for
the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the
loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve
noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss
function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly
reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one
symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and
effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is
available at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax.

Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端可能因技术问题、不利数据或恶意攻击发送异常更新，导致全局模型性能下降。现有防御机制通常需要不切实际的先验知识，难以实际应用。

Method: 提出ASMR方法，基于客户端的角度距离动态排除异常客户端，无需超参数或异常客户端数量的先验知识。

Result: 在病理图像分类任务中验证了ASMR的检测能力，并展示了动态调整决策边界的重要性。

Conclusion: ASMR是一种无需先验知识的实用方法，能有效提升联邦学习的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows the training of deep neural networks in a
distributed and privacy-preserving manner. However, this concept suffers from
malfunctioning updates sent by the attending clients that cause global model
performance degradation. Reasons for this malfunctioning might be technical
issues, disadvantageous training data, or malicious attacks. Most of the
current defense mechanisms are meant to require impractical prerequisites like
knowledge about the number of malfunctioning updates, which makes them
unsuitable for real-world applications. To counteract these problems, we
introduce a novel method called Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client
Resilience (ASMR), that dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients based on
their angular distance. Our novel method does not require any hyperparameters
or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients. Our experiments
showcase the detection capabilities of ASMR in an image classification task on
a histopathological dataset, while also presenting findings on the significance
of dynamically adapting decision boundaries.

Conclusion: ML分类器支持更透明、临床对齐的医学形状建模评估协议。

Abstract: While 3D medical shape generative models such as diffusion models have shown
promise in synthesizing diverse and anatomically plausible structures, the
absence of ground truth makes quality evaluation challenging. Existing
evaluation metrics commonly measure distributional distances between training
and generated sets, while the medical field requires assessing quality at the
individual level for each generated shape, which demands labor-intensive expert
review.
  In this paper, we investigate the use of classical machine learning (ML)
methods and PointNet as an alternative, interpretable approach for assessing
the quality of generated liver shapes. We sample point clouds from the surfaces
of the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and
train a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as
good or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to
assess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.
  Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only
interpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert
evaluation. This suggests that ML classifiers can serve as lightweight,
task-relevant quality metrics in 3D organ shape generation, supporting more
transparent and clinically aligned evaluation protocols in medical shape
modeling.

Abstract: The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like
Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training.
However, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the
right to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two
distinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and
their associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a
user's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully
address both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data
removal or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work
introduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution
to these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy
tailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning,
it uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process,
which is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any
remaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client
unlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to
purge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The
framework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across
both client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where
it materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness
of other established methods.

Conclusion: 通过考虑专家不确定性，可以有效减少标签噪声并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical
notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However,
these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the
clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to
make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or
``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these
nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for
handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the
problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important
issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better
incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image
analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of
clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert
uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which
significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization aims to learn to solve a class of
combinatorial problems through data-driven methods and notably through
employing neural networks by learning the underlying distribution of problem
instances. While, so far neural methods struggle to outperform highly
engineered problem specific meta-heuristics, this work explores a novel
approach to formulate the distribution of problem instances to learn from and,
more importantly, plant a structure in the sampled problem instances. In
application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that
represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training
instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the
routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large
problem instance. We evaluate representative NCO methods and specialized
Operation Research meta heuristics on this novel task and demonstrate that the
performance gap between neural routing solvers and highly specialized
meta-heuristics decreases when learning from sub-samples drawn from a fixed
base node distribution.

Abstract: Despite advances in analog design automation, analog front-end design still
heavily depends on expert intuition and iterative simulations, underscoring
critical gaps in fully automated optimization for performance-critical
applications. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has brought new promise to analog design automation. However, existing work
remains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical
end-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored. We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a
unified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities
and optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize
device sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized
schematic netlists. AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning
LLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal
diagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform
images. By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists,
AnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the
formulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for
simultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these orthogonal approaches significantly improve
the success rate of analog circuit design and enhance circuit performance.

Result: SplitMe在成本和收敛性上显著优于SFL、FedAvg和O-RANFed。

Conclusion: SplitMe为O-RAN中的联邦学习提供了高效且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: The hierarchical architecture of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has
enabled a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm that trains models using data
from non- and near-real-time (near-RT) Radio Intelligent Controllers (RICs).
However, the ever-increasing model size leads to longer training time,
jeopardizing the deadline requirements for both non-RT and near-RT RICs. To
address this issue, split federated learning (SFL) offers an approach by
offloading partial model layers from near-RT-RIC to high-performance
non-RT-RIC. Nonetheless, its deployment presents two challenges: (i) Frequent
data/gradient transfers between near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC in SFL incur
significant communication cost in O-RAN. (ii) Proper allocation of
computational and communication resources in O-RAN is vital to satisfying the
deadline and affects SFL convergence. Therefore, we propose SplitMe, an SFL
framework that exploits mutual learning to alternately and independently train
the near-RT-RIC's model and the non-RT-RIC's inverse model, eliminating
frequent transfers. The ''inverse'' of the inverse model is derived via a
zeroth-order technique to integrate the final model. Then, we solve a joint
optimization problem for SplitMe to minimize overall resource costs with
deadline-aware selection of near-RT-RICs and adaptive local updates. Our
numerical results demonstrate that SplitMe remarkably outperforms FL frameworks
like SFL, FedAvg and O-RANFed regarding costs and convergence.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective for solving PDEs by
incorporating physical laws into the learning process. However, they face
challenges with irregular boundaries, leading to instability and slow
convergence due to inconsistent normalization, inaccurate boundary enforcement,

space, but traditional methods rely on case-specific meshes and simple
geometries, limiting their compatibility with modern frameworks. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce JacobiNet, a neural network-based coordinate
transformation method that learns continuous, differentiable mappings from
supervised point pairs. Utilizing lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet allows for direct
Jacobian computation via autograd and integrates seamlessly with downstream
PINNs, enabling end-to-end differentiable PDE solving without the need for
meshing or explicit Jacobian computation. JacobiNet effectively addresses
normalization challenges, facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions,
and mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. It demonstrates
significant improvements, reducing the relative L2 error from 0.287-0.637 to
0.013-0.039, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.3*. In vessel-like
domains, it enables rapid mapping for unseen geometries, improving prediction
accuracy by 3.65* and achieving over 10* speedup, showcasing its
generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Transformer注意力图中的注意力汇（AS）现象，揭示了其作为高维空间中建立稳定参考框架的几何原理表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AS现象的本质及其在Transformer中的作用，理解其与参考框架的关系。

Method: 分析多种架构，识别三种参考框架类型（集中式、分布式、双向式），并研究其与AS现象的关联。

Result: 发现AS现象是训练早期为建立高维空间稳定坐标系统的最优解，且受位置编码实现方式影响。

Conclusion: 研究改变了人们对Transformer注意力机制的理解，为架构设计和AS关系提供了新视角。

Abstract: Attention sink (AS) is a consistent pattern in transformer attention maps
where certain tokens (often special tokens or positional anchors)
disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in
transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation
of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames
that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and
identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and
bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that
they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the
problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces.
We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position
encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This
perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms
and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with
AS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过大规模系统比较XAI方法，揭示了GradCAM和Layer-wise Relevance Propagation在神经影像数据中的系统性失败，而SmoothGrad表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证XAI方法在神经影像应用中的可靠性，避免因方法不严谨导致的误解。

Method: 使用45,000张结构脑MRI，通过构建已知信号源的预测任务，系统比较多种XAI方法。

Result: GradCAM无法准确定位特征，Layer-wise Relevance Propagation产生大量虚假解释，而SmoothGrad表现稳定。

Conclusion: XAI方法需针对神经影像数据进行领域适配和验证，现有研究结果需重新评估。

Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for
neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack
rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first
large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain
MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes
verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal
sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical
lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals
systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM
consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest
incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate
that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design
principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for
neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,
which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently
accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this
domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation
and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior
neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and
provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

*Javier Fumanal-Idocin,Raquel Fernandez-Peralta,Javier Andreu-Perez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于规则系统的动态特征选择（DFS）方法，提高了决策的可解释性，并提供了特征查询的不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态特征选择方法使用统一的特征集，缺乏透明性，尤其在需要决策透明性的场景（如临床决策）中不适用。

Method: 利用规则系统作为DFS的基础分类器，增强决策可解释性，并通过约束特征搜索空间降低计算复杂度。

Result: 该方法在性能上与现有贪婪和强化学习方法竞争，同时提供了更高的透明性和不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 基于规则的DFS方法在透明性和性能上优于传统不透明模型，适用于需要高解释性的场景。

Abstract: Dynamic feature selection (DFS) offers a compelling alternative to
traditional, static feature selection by adapting the selected features to each
individual sample. Unlike classical methods that apply a uniform feature set,
DFS customizes feature selection per sample, providing insight into the
decision-making process for each case. DFS is especially significant in
settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions; however,
existing methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in
real-life scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging a
rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances
decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. We also show how this
method provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty for each feature query
and can make the feature selection process computationally lighter by
constraining the feature search space. We also discuss when greedy selection of
conditional mutual information is equivalent to selecting features that
minimize the difference with respect to the global model predictions. Finally,
we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach
against established and state-of-the-art greedy and RL methods, which are
mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rule-based system.

Method: 分析了PEFT应用于MoE语言模型时的核心组件动态，并研究了不同路由策略对适配效果的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为PEFT和MoE的应用提供了实用见解，促进了更好的适配策略设计。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) benefits from a dynamic routing mechanism among
their specialized experts, which existing Parameter- Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategies fail to leverage. This motivates us to investigate whether
adaptation modules themselves should incorporate routing mechanisms to align
with MoE's multi-expert architecture. We analyze dynamics of core components
when applying PEFT to MoE language models and examine how different routing
strategies affect adaptation effectiveness. Extensive experiments adapting
OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on various commonsense and math reasoning tasks
validate the performance and efficiency of our routed approach. We identify the
optimal configurations for different scenarios and provide empirical analyses
with practical insights to facilitate better PEFT and MoE applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图数据常表现出复杂的几何异质性，现有固定曲率或离散乘积空间的几何GNN难以捕捉这种多样性。

Method: 提出ARGNN框架，学习连续且各向异性的黎曼度量张量场，结合Ricci流正则化确保几何稳定性和训练稳定性。

Result: 在多种基准数据集上表现优异，能够自适应捕捉多样结构，并提供可解释的几何洞察。

Conclusion: ARGNN不仅统一了现有固定或混合曲率GNN，还通过理论分析和实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures
with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense
communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which
embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces,
struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph
Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and
anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node
to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to
the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient
parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable
diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining
computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training,
we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned
manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution
convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that
unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method
demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark
datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover,
the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying
graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.

TL;DR: StructSynth是一个结合LLMs生成能力和结构控制的新框架，用于解决表格数据生成中的低保真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业领域中，表格数据的稀缺性限制了机器学习的应用。传统生成方法在低数据量下表现不佳，而LLMs常忽略数据依赖结构，导致生成质量低。

Method: StructSynth采用两阶段架构：先通过显式结构发现学习DAG，再用该结构引导LLM生成过程，确保数据依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明，StructSynth生成的合成数据在结构完整性和下游任务表现上优于现有方法，尤其在低数据量场景下效果显著。

Conclusion: StructSynth成功平衡了隐私保护与统计保真度，为表格数据生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The application of machine learning on tabular data in specialized domains is
severely limited by data scarcity. While generative models offer a solution,
traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language
Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data,
leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce
StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs
with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture.
First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a
high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to
adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated
data respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher
structural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It
proves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully
navigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry
recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage},
TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were
constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph
models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to
users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models
to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data
and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we
constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad
interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we
introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads
ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly
incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were
observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the
Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE
finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a
significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR)
prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's
Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC
reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged
by other large-scale industrial models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在时间序列预测中的可解释性差和对噪声敏感的问题。

Method: 采用模块化的编码器-传播器-解码器结构，通过谱约束的线性Koopman算子在潜在空间学习时间动态，并引入结构保证（如谱半径有界、Lyapunov能量正则化）。

Result: 在合成动态系统、真实气候数据、金融时间序列和电力数据集上，DeepKoopFormer在准确性、抗噪性和长期稳定性上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: DeepKoopFormer为高维和动态环境中的预测提供了一个灵活、可解释且稳健的框架。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role across scientific, industrial, and
environmental domains, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and
nonlinear systems. While Transformer-based models have recently achieved
state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from
interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical
uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting
framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the
theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular
encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a
spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose
structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy
regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and
interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic
dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface
pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation
dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all
experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline
Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term
forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible,
interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and
dynamical settings.

Abstract: Medical datasets are typically affected by issues such as missing values,
class imbalance, a heterogeneous feature types, and a high number of features
versus a relatively small number of samples, preventing machine learning models
from obtaining proper results in classification and regression tasks. This
paper introduces AutoML-Med, an Automated Machine Learning tool specifically
designed to address these challenges, minimizing user intervention and
identifying the optimal combination of preprocessing techniques and predictive
models. AutoML-Med's architecture incorporates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
for exploring preprocessing methods, trains models using selected metrics, and
utilizes Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for fine-tuned
optimization of the most influential preprocessing steps. Experimental results
demonstrate AutoML-Med's effectiveness in two different clinical settings,
achieving higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity, which are crucial for
identifying at-risk patients, compared to other state-of-the-art tools.
AutoML-Med's ability to improve prediction results, especially in medical
datasets with sparse data and class imbalance, highlights its potential to
streamline Machine Learning applications in healthcare.

Motivation: 探索如何利用少量数据和对抗训练发现独特的音频变换，为效果设计提供新方法。

Method: 使用Conditioning Aware Kernels（CAK）和AuGAN技术，通过对抗训练验证控制应用，而非生成或检测伪造。

Result: 学习到的卷积核具有对角结构，能产生频率依赖的时间偏移，实现音乐效果。

Conclusion: 对抗训练可从少量数据中发现音频变换，为效果设计开辟新途径。

Abstract: We demonstrate that a single 3x3 convolutional kernel can produce emergent
audio effects when trained on 200 samples from a personalized corpus. We
achieve this through two key techniques: (1) Conditioning Aware Kernels (CAK),
where output = input + (learned_pattern x control), with a soft-gate mechanism
supporting identity preservation at zero control; and (2) AuGAN (Audit GAN),
which reframes adversarial training from "is this real?" to "did you apply the
requested value?" Rather than learning to generate or detect forgeries, our
networks cooperate to verify control application, discovering unique
transformations. The learned kernel exhibits a diagonal structure creating
frequency-dependent temporal shifts that are capable of producing musical
effects based on input characteristics. Our results show the potential of
adversarial training to discover audio transformations from minimal data,
enabling new approaches to effect design.

Conclusion: LOST是一种高效且性能优越的LLM预训练方法，适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive
computational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies
have investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing
model size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a
complementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank
compression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However,
existing approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a
simplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance
degradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{LO}w-rank and \textbf{S}parse pre-\textbf{T}raining (\textbf{LOST}) for
LLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures
to enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency
constraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices,
preserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining
singular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the
expressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining
ranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves
competitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while
significantly reducing both memory and compute overhead. Moreover, Code is

Conclusion: 研究为分类和患病率估计提供了统一的误差界限方法，但多类问题的解决方案仍需进一步探索。

Abstract: Motivated by canonical problems in medical diagnostics, we propose and study
properties of an objective function that uniformly bounds uncertainties in
quantities of interest extracted from classifiers and related data analysis
tools. We begin by adopting a set-theoretic perspective to show how two main
tasks in diagnostics -- classification and prevalence estimation -- can be
recast in terms of a variation on the confusion (or error) matrix ${\boldsymbol
{\rm P}}$ typically considered in supervised learning. We then combine
arguments from conditional probability with the Gershgorin circle theorem to
demonstrate that the largest Gershgorin radius $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ of the
matrix $\mathbb I-\boldsymbol {\rm P}$ (where $\mathbb I$ is the identity)
yields uniform error bounds for both classification and prevalence estimation.
In a two-class setting, $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ is minimized via a
measure-theoretic ``water-leveling'' argument that optimizes an appropriately
defined partition $U$ generating the matrix ${\boldsymbol {\rm P}}$. We also
consider an example that illustrates the difficulty of generalizing the binary
solution to a multi-class setting and deduce relevant properties of the
confusion matrix.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了DNN预测不确定性的量化问题，还为稀疏学习理论在DNN中的应用提供了平台。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized modern data science. However, how to
accurately quantify the uncertainty of predictions from large-scale deep neural
networks (DNNs) remains an unresolved issue. To address this issue, we
introduce a novel post-processing approach. This approach feeds the output from
the last hidden layer of a pre-trained large-scale DNN model into a stochastic
neural network (StoNet), then trains the StoNet with a sparse penalty on a
validation dataset and constructs prediction intervals for future observations.
We establish a theoretical guarantee for the validity of this approach; in
particular, the parameter estimation consistency for the sparse StoNet is
essential for the success of this approach. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed approach can construct honest confidence
intervals with shorter interval lengths compared to conformal methods and
achieves better calibration compared to other post-hoc calibration techniques.
Additionally, we show that the StoNet formulation provides us with a platform
to adapt sparse learning theory and methods from linear models to DNNs.

Conclusion: Flow IV方法在非可分离模型中实现了反事实推理，为因果推理提供了新的工具。

Abstract: To reach human level intelligence, learning algorithms need to incorporate
causal reasoning. But identifying causality, and particularly counterfactual
reasoning, remains an elusive task. In this paper, we make progress on this
task by utilizing instrumental variables (IVs). IVs are a classic tool for
mitigating bias from unobserved confounders when estimating causal effects.
While IV methods have been extended to non-separable structural models at the
population level, existing approaches to counterfactual prediction typically
assume additive noise in the outcome. In this paper, we show that under
standard IV assumptions, along with the assumptions that latent noises in
treatment and outcome are strictly monotonic and jointly Gaussian, the
treatment-outcome relationship becomes uniquely identifiable from observed
data. This enables counterfactual inference even in nonseparable models. We
implement our approach by training a normalizing flow to maximize the
likelihood of the observed data, demonstrating accurate recovery of the
underlying outcome function. We call our method Flow IV.

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on Earth observation data, such as satellite
imagery, have demonstrated significant promise in predicting household-level
wealth indices, enabling the creation of high-resolution wealth maps that can
be leveraged across multiple causal trials. However, because standard training
objectives prioritize overall predictive accuracy, these predictions inherently
suffer from shrinkage toward the mean, leading to attenuated estimates of
causal treatment effects and limiting their utility in policy. Existing
debiasing methods, such as Prediction-Powered Inference, can handle this
attenuation bias but require additional fresh ground-truth data at the
downstream stage of causal inference, which restricts their applicability in
data-scarce environments. Here, we introduce and evaluate two correction
methods -- linear calibration correction and Tweedie's correction -- that
substantially reduce prediction bias without relying on newly collected labeled
data. Linear calibration corrects bias through a straightforward linear
transformation derived from held-out calibration data, whereas Tweedie's
correction leverages empirical Bayes principles to directly address
shrinkage-induced biases by exploiting score functions derived from the model's
learning patterns. Through analytical exercises and experiments using
Demographic and Health Survey data, we demonstrate that the proposed methods
meet or outperform existing approaches that either require (a) adjustments to
training pipelines or (b) additional labeled data. These approaches may
represent a promising avenue for improving the reliability of causal inference
when direct outcome measures are limited or unavailable, enabling a "one map,
many trials" paradigm where a single upstream data creation team produces
predictions usable by many downstream teams across diverse ML pipelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代应用中（如核物理探测器优化），每次实验运行耗时巨大，传统黑盒优化方法在高维空间中表现不佳，需要更高效的解决方案。

Result: BOMM在高维空间中表现优于传统方法，优化速率减缓了维度灾难，并在核物理探测器优化中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: BOMM是一种高效的黑盒优化方法，特别适用于高维复杂系统的优化问题。

Abstract: With advances in scientific computing, computer experiments are increasingly
used for optimizing complex systems. However, for modern applications, e.g.,
the optimization of nuclear physics detectors, each experiment run can require
hundreds of CPU hours, making the optimization of its black-box simulator over
a high-dimensional space a challenging task. Given limited runs at inputs
$\mathbf{x}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_n$, the best solution from these evaluated
inputs can be far from optimal, particularly as dimensionality increases.
Existing black-box methods, however, largely employ this ''pick-the-winner''
(PW) solution, which leads to mediocre optimization performance. To address
this, we propose a new Black-box Optimization via Marginal Means (BOMM)
approach. The key idea is a new estimator of a global optimizer $\mathbf{x}^*$
that leverages the so-called marginal mean functions, which can be efficiently
inferred with limited runs in high dimensions. Unlike PW, this estimator can
select solutions beyond evaluated inputs for improved optimization performance.
Assuming the objective function follows a generalized additive model with
unknown link function and under mild conditions, we prove that the BOMM
estimator not only is consistent for optimization, but also has an optimization
rate that tempers the ''curse-of-dimensionality'' faced by existing methods,
thus enabling better performance as dimensionality increases. We present a
practical framework for implementing BOMM using the transformed additive
Gaussian process surrogate model. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
BOMM in numerical experiments and an application on neutrino detector
optimization in nuclear physics.

Conclusion: 该算法为低维大规模数据的高斯过程推断提供了一种有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: To speed up Gaussian process inference, a number of fast kernel matrix-vector
multiplication (MVM) approximation algorithms have been proposed over the
years. In this paper, we establish an exact fast kernel MVM algorithm based on
exact kernel decomposition into weighted empirical cumulative distribution
functions, compatible with a class of kernels which includes multivariate
Mat\'ern kernels with half-integer smoothness parameter. This algorithm uses a
divide-and-conquer approach, during which sorting outputs are stored in a data
structure. We also propose a new algorithm to take into account some linear
fixed effects predictor function. Our numerical experiments confirm that our
algorithm is very effective for low-dimensional Gaussian process inference
problems with hundreds of thousands of data points. An implementation of our
algorithm is available at
https://gitlab.com/warin/fastgaussiankernelregression.git.

Abstract: Recent developments in causal inference have greatly shifted the interest
from estimating the average treatment effect to the individual treatment
effect. In this article, we improve the predictive accuracy of representation
learning and adversarial networks in estimating individual treatment effects by
introducing a structure keeper which maintains the correlation between the
baseline covariates and their corresponding representations in the high
dimensional space. We train a discriminator at the end of representation layers
to trade off representation balance and information loss. We show that the
proposed discriminator minimizes an upper bound of the treatment estimation
error. We can address the tradeoff between distribution balance and information
loss by considering the correlations between the learned representation space
and the original covariate feature space. We conduct extensive experiments with
simulated and real-world observational data to show that our proposed Structure
Maintained Representation Learning (SMRL) algorithm outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the algorithms on real electronic
health record data from the MIMIC-III database.

Abstract: The rise of generative models for scientific research calls for the
development of new methods to evaluate their fidelity. A natural framework for
addressing this problem is two-sample hypothesis testing, namely the task of
determining whether two data sets are drawn from the same distribution. In
large-scale and high-dimensional regimes, machine learning offers a set of
tools to push beyond the limitations of standard statistical techniques. In
this work, we put this claim to the test by comparing a recent proposal from
the high-energy physics literature, the New Physics Learning Machine, to
perform a classification-based two-sample test against a number of alternative
approaches, following the framework presented in Grossi et al. (2025). We
highlight the efficiency tradeoffs of the method and the computational costs
that come from adopting learning-based approaches. Finally, we discuss the
advantages of the different methods for different use cases.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) excels at producing complex data
structures (text, images, videos) by learning patterns from training examples.
Across scientific disciplines, researchers are now applying generative models
to ``inverse problems'' to infer hidden parameters from observed data. While
these methods can handle intractable models and large-scale studies, they can
also produce biased or overconfident conclusions. We present a solution with
Frequentist-Bayes (FreB), a mathematically rigorous protocol that reshapes
AI-generated probability distributions into confidence regions that
consistently include true parameters with the expected probability, while
achieving minimum size when training and target data align. We demonstrate
FreB's effectiveness by tackling diverse case studies in the physical sciences:
identifying unknown sources under dataset shift, reconciling competing
theoretical models, and mitigating selection bias and systematics in
observational studies. By providing validity guarantees with interpretable
diagnostics, FreB enables trustworthy scientific inference across fields where
direct likelihood evaluation remains impossible or prohibitively expensive.
