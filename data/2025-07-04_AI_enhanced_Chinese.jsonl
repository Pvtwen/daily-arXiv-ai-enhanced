However, existing studies ignore the physical\nconstraints of antenna placement and assume fixed antenna radiation power. To\nfill this research gap, this paper investigates the design of PASS taking into\naccount the motion power consumption of pinching-antennas (PAs) and the impact\nof adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average\npower consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly\noptimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit\nbeamforming. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to\nconsider radiation power optimization in PASS, which provides an additional\ndegree of freedom (DoF) for system design. The cases with both continuous and\ndiscrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the\nfact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the\nchannel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging. To\ntackle the resulting unique obstacles, an alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM)-based framework is proposed to solve the problem for\ncontinuous antenna movement, while its discrete counterpart is formulated as a\nmixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved by the block\ncoordinate descent (BCD) method. Simulation results validate the performance\nenhancement achieved by incorporating PA movement power assumption and\nadjustable radiation power into PASS design, while also demonstrating the\nefficiency of the proposed optimization framework.

Hence, we\npropose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,\ndesigned for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal\ncoarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable\nfinite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent\napproximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error\ncorrection on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few\ntrajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a\nhigh accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow\nsystems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable\nmargins.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u6709\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u6c42\u89e3\u5668LDSolver\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7c97\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u6d41\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7f51\u683c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "LDSolver\u7531\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u7ec4\u6210\uff1a(1)\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6709\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c(2)\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7c97\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b49\u6548\u901a\u91cf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\uff0cLDSolver\u4e5f\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6d41\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LDSolver\u5728\u7c97\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, intelligent\nmachines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge\nvolume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques\nand rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive\ndata. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object\npairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the\ndiscriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature\nselection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved\nsamples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory\nability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.\nFirst, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the\ndiscriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set\nwithin an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of\nthe probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature\nsubset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be\nestimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes\nwere used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate\nreducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory\nability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.\nExperiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate\nreduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a\npersonal computer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7c97\u7cd9\u96c6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u627e\u5230\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u673a\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8861\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6b63\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u7559\u6837\u672c\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u627e\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ea6\u7b80\uff0c\u4e14\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0b\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a\ncritical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and\npredictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in\nsemiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high\ndata dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,\nnoisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production\nsystems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the\ndelayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly\ndetection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic\napproach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one\nserving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the\nother as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the\nembeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at\na given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying\nanomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising\nsolution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.\nMoreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and\nsemi-supervised settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684VGG-16\u548cSiamese\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e14\u566a\u58f0\u591a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b2. \u5fae\u8c03VGG-16\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b3. \u6784\u5efaSiamese\u7f51\u7edc\u6bd4\u8f83\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

(Accepted)", "summary": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific\napplications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to\nlarge-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph\nstructures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As\nthe size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an\nout-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained\nsystems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of\nout-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory\nlayout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer\nfrom both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.\n  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where\nsparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance\nbottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to\naccelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the\nalgorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the\nblock level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to\nfacilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a\nthree-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy\nutilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage\n(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.\nEvaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing\nbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AIRES\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5-\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901fGCNs\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8I/O\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8I/O\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "AIRES\u901a\u8fc7\u5757\u7ea7\u7a00\u758f\u683c\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5206\u5757\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u53cc\u8def\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GPU\u5185\u5b58\u3001GDS\u548c\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAIRES\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe1.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AIRES\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, efficiently fine-tuning them for\ndownstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this\nwork, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables\nflexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks\nwithout modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a\nstructured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling\noperators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model\nlayers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an\nequivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight\nadapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while\nmitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that\nthe proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric\ninductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during\nadaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse\ngeometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph\ncontrol, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,\nmolecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation.

By\nharnessing permutation properties broadly exist in resource allocation\npolicies, each mapping measurable environmental parameters (e.g., channel\nmatrix) to optimized variables (e.g., precoding matrix), graph neural networks\n(GNNs) are promising for learning these policies efficiently in terms of\nscalability and generalizability. To reap the benefits of both architectures,\nthere is a recent trend of incorporating attention mechanism with GNNs for\nlearning wireless policies. Nevertheless, is the attention mechanism really\nneeded for resource allocation? In this paper, we strive to answer this\nquestion by analyzing the structures of functions defined on sets and numerical\nalgorithms, given that the permutation properties of wireless policies are\ninduced by the involved sets (say user set). In particular, we prove that the\npermutation equivariant functions on a single set can be recursively expressed\nby two types of functions: one involves attention, and the other does not. We\nproceed to re-express the numerical algorithms for optimizing several\nrepresentative resource allocation problems in recursive forms. We find that\nwhen interference (say multi-user or inter-data stream interference) is not\nreflected in the measurable parameters of a policy, attention needs to be used\nto model the interference.

Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers\n(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy\nvalue to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions\nthrough gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across\nboth discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale\nfaster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an\nup to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,\nFLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2\nThinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs\noutperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward\npasses. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models\non most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,\nsuggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches.

To realize the full\npotential of this scheme, this paper focuses on the comprehensive transceiver\ndesign, addressing key challenges in signal detection at the receiver and\nperformance optimization at thetransmitter. First, a comprehensive channel\nmodel is formulated for this architecture, which sophisticatedly integrates the\ndeterministic in-waveguide propagation effects with the stochastic nature of\nwireless channels, including both largescale path loss and small-scale fading.\nNext, to overcome the prohibitive complexity of optimal maximum likelihood (ML)\ndetection, a low-complexity box-optimized sphere decoding (BOSD) algorithm is\ndesigned, which adaptively prunes the search space whilst preserving optimal ML\nperformance. Furthermore, an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate (BER)\nis derived and validated by the simulations. Moreover, a new transmit precoding\nmethod is designed using manifold optimization, which minimizes the BER by\njointly optimizing the complex-valued precoding coefficients across the\nwaveguides for the sake of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of all\nreceived signal points.

AMR selectively removes outdated samples of\ndrifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number\nof up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new\ndistribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while\nreducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.\n  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants\nof standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and\nTiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted\nrepresentations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several\nrehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,\nmaintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as\na scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary\ncontinual learning environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAMR\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAMR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u79fb\u9664\u8fc7\u65f6\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u8865\u5145\u65b0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u3002", "result": "AMR\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08FR\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "AMR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u975e\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \\b{eta}-VAE, wherein\nthe hyperparameter, \\b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the\nlimitations of \\b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the\nloss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and\nreconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and\nthe parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An\nadditional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias\ntowards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses.

Results show that rule-based agents achieve\nnear-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability\n(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics.

MADDPG provides a more balanced\napproach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while\nmaintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing.

We demonstrate\nthat the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than\nstandard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models\noutperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,\ncoding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that\n$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge\nand reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e862-\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347token\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u518d\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684token\u5229\u7528\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa2-\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62Transformer\uff0c\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u70b9\u79ef\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Triton\u5185\u6838\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u7f16\u7a0b\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u540ctoken\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c2-\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62Transformer\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u3002", "conclusion": "2-\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176token\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, existing studies ignore the physical\nconstraints of antenna placement and assume fixed antenna radiation power. To\nfill this research gap, this paper investigates the design of PASS taking into\naccount the motion power consumption of pinching-antennas (PAs) and the impact\nof adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average\npower consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly\noptimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit\nbeamforming. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to\nconsider radiation power optimization in PASS, which provides an additional\ndegree of freedom (DoF) for system design. The cases with both continuous and\ndiscrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the\nfact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the\nchannel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging. To\ntackle the resulting unique obstacles, an alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM)-based framework is proposed to solve the problem for\ncontinuous antenna movement, while its discrete counterpart is formulated as a\nmixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved by the block\ncoordinate descent (BCD) method. Simulation results validate the performance\nenhancement achieved by incorporating PA movement power assumption and\nadjustable radiation power into PASS design, while also demonstrating the\nefficiency of the proposed optimization framework.

Two case studies for RIS and movable\nantenna-enabled single-input single-output (SISO) systems are provided to show\nthe superiority of ZO-based methods as compared to state-of-the-art techniques.\nFinally, we outline promising future research directions and offer concluding\ninsights on derivative-free optimization for reconfigurable antenna\ntechnologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u5bfc\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff08\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u6570\u4ee5\u5851\u9020\u65e0\u7ebf\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u64ad\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u57286G\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u5929\u7ebf\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982RIS\u3001MA\u3001FA\u7b49\uff09\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u7cfb\u6570\u4ee5\u5851\u9020\u6709\u5229\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u5bfc\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff08\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7RIS\u548c\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u7684SISO\u7cfb\u7edf\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u5bfc\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u5929\u7ebf\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u91cd\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, intelligent\nmachines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge\nvolume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques\nand rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive\ndata. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object\npairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the\ndiscriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature\nselection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved\nsamples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory\nability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.\nFirst, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the\ndiscriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set\nwithin an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of\nthe probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature\nsubset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be\nestimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes\nwere used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate\nreducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory\nability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.\nExperiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate\nreduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a\npersonal computer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7c97\u7cd9\u96c6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u6784\u9020\u6b63\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u7559\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u627e\u5230\u9ad8\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u673a\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8861\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u9020\u6b63\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u7559\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u627e\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ea6\u7b80\uff0c\u4e14\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0b\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u627e\u5230\u9ad8\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one\nserving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the\nother as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the\nembeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at\na given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying\nanomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising\nsolution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.\nMoreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and\nsemi-supervised settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u548cSiamese\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u591a\u4e14\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VGG-16\u67b6\u6784\u6784\u5efaSiamese\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9eFAB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

(Accepted)", "summary": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific\napplications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to\nlarge-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph\nstructures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As\nthe size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an\nout-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained\nsystems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of\nout-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory\nlayout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer\nfrom both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.\n  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where\nsparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance\nbottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to\naccelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the\nalgorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the\nblock level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to\nfacilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a\nthree-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy\nutilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage\n(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.\nEvaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing\nbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faAIRES\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5-\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GCNs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u901a\u7528\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff08SpGEMM\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6269\u5927\uff0cSpGEMM\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ee5\u6838\u5916\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8I/O\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "AIRES\u4ece\u7b97\u6cd5\u89d2\u5ea6\u63d0\u51fa\u5757\u7ea7\u7a00\u758f\u683c\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5206\u5757\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u53cc\u8def\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "AIRES\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe1.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AIRES\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6838\u5916SpGEMM\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this\nwork, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables\nflexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks\nwithout modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a\nstructured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling\noperators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model\nlayers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an\nequivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight\nadapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while\nmitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that\nthe proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric\ninductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during\nadaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse\ngeometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph\ncontrol, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,\nmolecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation.

Submitted to NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline\ncandidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and\nalgorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from\nOpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our\nproprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate\nmatching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,\nPrecision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis\nacross declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on\na dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that\nMatch Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs\n0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic\ngroups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957\n(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the\nintersectionals, respectively).

To realize the full\npotential of this scheme, this paper focuses on the comprehensive transceiver\ndesign, addressing key challenges in signal detection at the receiver and\nperformance optimization at thetransmitter. First, a comprehensive channel\nmodel is formulated for this architecture, which sophisticatedly integrates the\ndeterministic in-waveguide propagation effects with the stochastic nature of\nwireless channels, including both largescale path loss and small-scale fading.\nNext, to overcome the prohibitive complexity of optimal maximum likelihood (ML)\ndetection, a low-complexity box-optimized sphere decoding (BOSD) algorithm is\ndesigned, which adaptively prunes the search space whilst preserving optimal ML\nperformance. Furthermore, an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate (BER)\nis derived and validated by the simulations. Moreover, a new transmit precoding\nmethod is designed using manifold optimization, which minimizes the BER by\njointly optimizing the complex-valued precoding coefficients across the\nwaveguides for the sake of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of all\nreceived signal points.

The\nsimulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC\nnetwork exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing\nSC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\uff08KGZS-SC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff08KG-SKB\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u91c7\u7528\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ZSL\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u7c7b\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728APY\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cKGZS-SC\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "KGZS-SC\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment\n(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a\ndrift-aware adaptation mechanism.

The\nreliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR\ndata. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including\nmisrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they\nare primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality\nassessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess\ndata fitness for research.\n  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit\ntesting and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data\nquality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking\nTool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test\ngenerator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a\ntest suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework\nthat executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.\n  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and\nSyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions.

Crucially, this enables\nthe framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby\nfreeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely\non human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and\nseeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner\niteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,\nregularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and\nconstraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy\ncorresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at\nlower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By\ninterpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \\emph{functors} that generate\nand condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional\nstructure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively\ngeneralised tasks.

However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,\na tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which\nlimits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability.

With only 500\npost-training steps ($\\sim 0.1\\%$ of the pre-training budget), these\ninterventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of\nmagnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\\longrightarrow 128k$) and\nshow improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and\nefficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent\nmodels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u72b6\u6001\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u65f6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u5176\u4ed6\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u7528500\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\uff08\u59822k\u5230128k\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u6cdb\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The implementation of MvHo-IB is\navailable at https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB.", "AI": {"tldr": "MvHo-IB\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08HOIs\uff09\u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63d0\u5347fMRI\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08HOIs\uff09\u5728fMRI\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5229\u7528HOIs\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMvHo-IB\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684O-information\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u71b5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u91cf\u5316HOIs\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1Brain3DCNN\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6fMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMvHo-IB\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8d85\u56fe\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "MvHo-IB\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5229\u7528HOIs\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
