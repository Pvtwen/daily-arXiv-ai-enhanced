We advocate for pluralistic\nalignment, where an AI understands and is steerable towards diverse, and often\nconflicting, human values. Our work provides three core contributions to\nachieve this in T2I models. First, we introduce a novel dataset for Diverse\nIntersectional Visual Evaluation (DIVE) -- the first multimodal dataset for\npluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives\nthrough a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who\nprovided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication,\ncapturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm\ndemographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain,\nrevealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that\ndiverge from conventional evaluations. Finally, we discuss implications for\nbuilding aligned T2I models, including efficient data collection strategies,\nLLM judgment capabilities, and model steerability towards diverse perspectives.\nThis research offers foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I\nsystems.

However, location and motion\nparameters become inherently coupled in this regime, making their joint\nestimation computationally demanding. To overcome this, we propose a novel\napproach that projects the received two-dimensional space-time signal onto the\nangle-Doppler domain using a two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform\n(2D-DFT). Our analysis reveals that the resulting angular spread is centered at\nthe target's true angle, with its width determined by the target's range.\nSimilarly, transverse motion induces a Doppler spread centered at the true\nradial velocity, with the width of Doppler spread proportional to the\ntransverse velocity. Exploiting these spectral characteristics, we develop a\nlow-complexity algorithm that provides coarse estimates of angle, range, and\nvelocity, which are subsequently refined using one-dimensional multiple signal\nclassification (MUSIC) applied independently to each parameter. The proposed\nmethod enables accurate and efficient estimation of NF target motion\nparameters. Simulation results demonstrate a normalized mean squared error\n(NMSE) of -40 dB for location and velocity estimates compared to maximum\nlikelihood estimation, while significantly reducing computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72D-DFT\u548cMUSIC\u65b9\u6cd5\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fd1\u573a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd1\u573a\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u63a5\u6536\u5230\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8fc72D-DFT\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u89d2\u5ea6-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u57df\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7c97\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u4e00\u7ef4MUSIC\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a-40 dB\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u573a\u76ee\u6807\u8fd0\u52a8\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

The set of quality data can be expanded\nthrough trading or sharing with external data agents.

Previous works primarily rely on\ndistributional assumptions about data from different agents, relegating quality\nchecks to post-hoc steps involving costly data valuation procedures. We propose\na distribution-free, contamination-aware data-sharing framework that identifies\nexternal data agents whose data is most valuable for model personalization.

In identifying the best hyperparameters for benchmark datasets,\noverfitting is frequent, indicating that many estimators may not generalise\nwell beyond the datasets on which they have been tested.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u66f2\u7387\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8bb8\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u4eff\u5c04\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5207\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ef4\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u6216\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bb8\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\u666e\u904d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

We further\nanalyze the evolution of AI methodologies, from supervised learning and\nmulti-task learning to self-supervised learning, emphasizing the distinct\nadvantages of the latter in facilitating the development of CFMs. Additionally,\nwe provide a comprehensive review of existing studies on self-supervised\nlearning in this domain, categorizing them into generative, discriminative and\nthe combined paradigms. Given that the research on CFMs is still at an early\nstage, we identify several promising future research directions, focusing on\nmodel architecture innovation and the construction of high-quality, diverse\nchannel datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u901a\u9053\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08CFMs\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002CFMs\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCFMs\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5148\u8fdbAI\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "result": "CFMs\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u901a\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "CFMs\u4e3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684AI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, in many real-world applications, data are\nhigh-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of\nirregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is\ncritical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.\nIn this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the\ntransformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set\nof latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that\nintegrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor\ndecomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks\nusing the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and\nextracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design\nto enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm\nconverges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in\ntheoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor\ndecomposition.

Cross-validation across five\nfolds confirmed the robustness of the model, showing that both sensitivity and\nspecificity exceeded 0.8 when evaluated on independent data.

While learning-based methods\nwith Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at solving complex physical\nsystems, they encounter scalability issues when modeling deformable body\ninteractions. To model interactions between objects, pairwise global edges have\nto be created dynamically, which is computationally intensive and impractical\nfor large-scale meshes.

However, its impact on generalization under\nsubstantial data distribution shifts in audio classification remains largely\nunexplored. To address this gap, this work investigates how different\nadversarial training strategies improve generalization performance and\nadversarial robustness in audio classification. The study focuses on two model\narchitectures: a conventional convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt) and an\ninherently interpretable prototype-based model (AudioProtoPNet). The approach\nis evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This\nbenchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training\nand test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a\ncommon real-world challenge. The investigation explores two adversarial\ntraining strategies: one based on output-space attacks that maximize the\nclassification loss function, and another based on embedding-space attacks\ndesigned to maximize embedding dissimilarity.

Fine-tuning foundation\nmodels that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular\ndatabases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data\nnecessary to reach a desired level of accuracy.

However, there has been a revival\nof interest in formally grounding the representations learned by neural\nnetworks in causal concepts. Yet, most attempts at neural models of causality\nassume static causal graphs and ignore the dynamic nature of causal\ninteractions. In this work, we introduce Causal Process framework as a novel\ntheory for representing dynamic hypotheses about causal structure. Furthermore,\nwe present Causal Process Model as an implementation of this framework. This\nallows us to reformulate the attention mechanism popularized by Transformer\nnetworks within an RL setting with the goal to infer interpretable causal\nprocesses from visual observations.

Large-scale multi-site studies have exist, but they have\nacquisition-related biases due to scanner heterogeneity, compromising imaging\nconsistency and downstream analyses. While existing SC harmonization methods -\nsuch as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate\nthese biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or\noverlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a\nsite-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across\ndiverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a\nsimulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this\nframework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected\nautoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a\ntop-performing LR baseline.

However, it often relies on\npre-defined reward functions, which can be hard to design for balancing\nconflicting goals and may lead to oversimplification. Preferences can serve as\nmore flexible and intuitive decision-making guidance, eliminating the need for\ncomplicated reward design. This paper introduces preference-based MORL\n(Pb-MORL), which formalizes the integration of preferences into the MORL\nframework. We theoretically prove that preferences can derive policies across\nthe entire Pareto frontier. To guide policy optimization using preferences, our\nmethod constructs a multi-objective reward model that aligns with the given\npreferences. We further provide theoretical proof to show that optimizing this\nreward model is equivalent to training the Pareto optimal policy. Extensive\nexperiments in benchmark multi-objective tasks, a multi-energy management task,\nand an autonomous driving task on a multi-line highway show that our method\nperforms competitively, surpassing the oracle method, which uses the ground\ntruth reward function. This highlights its potential for practical applications\nin complex real-world systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Pb-MORL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u597d\u6307\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MORL\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u51b2\u7a81\u76ee\u6807\u4e14\u6613\u7b80\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u504f\u597d\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u76f4\u89c2\uff0c\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPb-MORL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u504f\u597d\u878d\u5165MORL\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u591a\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cPb-MORL\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Pb-MORL\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u597d\u6307\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We observe\nthat KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively\nthan Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However,\nconventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical\nstructure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade\nKANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs.
