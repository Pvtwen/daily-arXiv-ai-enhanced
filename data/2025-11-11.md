### [1] [AIRMap - AI-Generated Radio Maps for Wireless Digital Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05522)
*Ali Saeizadeh,Miead Tehrani-Moayyed,Davide Villa,J. Gordon Beattie Jr.,Pedram Johari,Stefano Basagni,Tommaso Melodia*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: AIRMap是一个基于深度学习的超快速无线电地图估计框架，仅使用2D地形和建筑高度图作为输入，在4毫秒内完成路径增益预测，比GPU加速的射线追踪快7000倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统射线追踪方法计算量大，无法满足动态条件下的实时无线网络仿真和数字孪生应用需求。

Method: 使用单输入U-Net自编码器处理2D高程图，训练了60,000个波士顿地区样本，覆盖500米到3公里范围，并通过轻量级迁移学习校准。

Result: 预测路径增益的RMSE低于5dB，使用20%现场测量校准后中位误差降至约10%，显著优于传统模拟器（误差超过50%）。在Colosseum仿真器和Sionna SYS平台中验证了接近零误差的频谱效率和块错误率。

Conclusion: AIRMap证明了在无线数字孪生中实现可扩展、准确和实时无线电地图估计的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate, low-latency channel modeling is essential for real-time wireless
network simulation and digital-twin applications. Traditional modeling methods
like ray tracing are however computationally demanding and unsuited to model
dynamic conditions. In this paper, we propose AIRMap, a deep-learning framework
for ultra-fast radio-map estimation, along with an automated pipeline for
creating the largest radio-map dataset to date. AIRMap uses a single-input
U-Net autoencoder that processes only a 2D elevation map of terrain and
building heights. Trained and evaluated on 60,000 Boston-area samples, spanning
coverage areas from 500 m to 3 km per side, AIRMap predicts path gain with
under 5 dB RMSE in 4 ms per inference on an NVIDIA L40S -over 7000x faster than
GPU-accelerated ray tracing based radio maps. A lightweight transfer learning
calibration using just 20% of field measurements reduces the median error to
approximately 10%, significantly outperforming traditional simulators, which
exceed 50% error. Integration into the Colosseum emulator and the Sionna SYS
platform demonstrate near-zero error in spectral efficiency and block-error
rate compared to measurement-based channels. These findings validate AIRMap's
potential for scalable, accurate, and real-time radio map estimation in
wireless digital twins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电磁模拟器需要专家配置且缺乏交互灵活性，难以实现直观的无线传播建模。

Method: 将射线追踪模型封装为可调用工具，由LLM解释自然语言目标、管理模拟流程，并进行视觉分析。

Result: 在城市无人机通信场景中，该代理能自主选择传播机制、执行确定性模拟，并提供路径损耗行为的语义和视觉总结。

Conclusion: RadioSim Agent提供了多模态可解释性和直观的用户交互，为新一代无线系统设计中的智能电磁模拟助手铺平了道路。

Abstract: Deterministic electromagnetic (EM) simulators provide accurate radio propagation modeling but often require expert configuration and lack interactive flexibility. We present RadioSim Agent, an agentic framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with physics-based EM solvers and vision-enabled reasoning to enable interactive and explainable radio map generation. The framework encapsulates ray-tracing models as callable simulation tools, orchestrated by an LLM capable of interpreting natural language objectives, managing simulation workflows, and visually analyzing resulting radio maps. Demonstrations in urban UAV communication scenarios show that the agent autonomously selects appropriate propagation mechanisms, executes deterministic simulations, and provides semantic and visual summaries of pathloss behavior. The results indicate that RadioSim Agent provides multimodal interpretability and intuitive user interaction, paving the way for intelligent EM simulation assistants in next-generation wireless system design.

### [3] [Invariants in Eddy Current Testing via Dimensional Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06035)
*Vincenzo Mottola,Alessandro Sardellitti,Filippo Milano,Luigi Ferrigno,Marco Laracca,Antonello Tamburrino*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于量纲分析的系统方法，用于推导涡流检测数据的不变变换，以隔离不确定参数的影响，提高无损检测的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无损检测应用中，通常只需要估计影响测量的变量子集，而忽略其他不确定参数。例如在涡流检测中，可能需要估计板材厚度和电导率，而不考虑探头提离距离的变化。不变变换的概念对于隔离有用信号与不确定参数至关重要。

Method: 通过量纲分析推导频率域涡流检测数据的不变变换。该方法基于白金汉π定理，利用无量纲群减少影响测量量的参数数量，使测量信号独立于一个或多个不确定参数。

Result: 通过不同厚度、电导率和提离距离的板材配置进行实验验证，证明该方法在广泛参数范围内实现了优异的估计精度。

Conclusion: 提出的系统方法能够有效推导不变变换，兼容实时和在线操作，显著提高了无损检测结果的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: The Buckingham's $π$, theorem has been recently introduced in the context of Non destructive Testing \& Evaluation (NdT\&E) , giving a theoretical basis for developing simple but effective methods for multi-parameter estimation via dimensional analysis. Dimensional groups, or $π-$groups, allow for the reduction of the number of parameters affecting the dimensionless measured quantities.
  In many real-world applications, the main interest is in estimating only a subset of the variables affecting the measurements. An example is estimating the thickness and electrical conductivity of a plate from Eddy Current Testing data, regardless of the lift-off of the probe, which may be either uncertain and/or variable. Alternatively, one may seek to estimate thickness and lift-off while neglecting the influence of the electrical conductivity, or to estimate the electrical conductivity and the lift-off, neglecting the thickness.
  This is where the concept of invariants becomes crucial. An invariant transformation is a mathematical mapping that makes the measured signal independent of one or more of these uncertain parameters. Invariant transformations provide a way to isolate useful signals from uncertain ones, improving the accuracy and reliability of the NdT results.
  The main contribution of this paper is a systematic method to derive \emph{invariant} transformations for frequency domain Eddy Current Testing data, via dimensional analysis. The proposed method is compatible with real-time and in-line operations.
  After its theoretical foundation is introduced, the method is validated by means of experimental data, with reference to configurations consisting of plates with different thicknesses, electrical conductivity, and lift-off. The experimental validation proves the effectiveness of the method in achieving excellent accuracy on a wide range of parameters of interest.

Conclusion: 通过在路径规划中综合考虑无线覆盖质量，可以在不显著增加行驶距离的情况下，显著改善自动驾驶车辆的无线连接性能。

Abstract: Fleets of autonomous vehicles (AV) often are at the core of intelligent transportation scenarios for smart cities, and may require a wireless Internet connection to offload computer vision tasks to data centers located either in the edge or the cloud section of the network. Cooperation among AVs is successful when the environment is unknown, or changes dynamically, so as to improve coverage and trip time, and minimize the traveled distance. The AVs, while mapping the environment with range-based sensors, move across the wireless coverage areas, with consequences on the achieved access bit rate, latency, and handover rate. In this paper, we propose to modify the cost of path planning algorithms such as Dijkstra and A*, so that not only the traveled distance is considered in the best path solution, but also the radio coverage experience. To this aim, several radio-related cost-weighting functions are introduced and tested, to assess the performance of the proposed techniques with extensive simulations. The proposed mapping algorithm can achieve a mapping error probability below 2%, while the proposed path-planning algorithms extend the experienced radio coverage of the AVs, with limited distance increase with respect to shortest-path existing methods, such as conventional Dijkstra and A* algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前帕金森病研究存在两个独立领域：多模态传感监测和机器人干预康复，两者缺乏有效整合。随着AI技术的发展，现在有机会将这两个互补领域统一起来。

Method: 提出闭环传感器-AI-机器人框架，利用多模态传感持续指导患者、护理人员和机器人之间的交互，通过AI代理（包括机器人基础模型、LLM推理、强化学习和持续学习）实现个性化干预。

Conclusion: 通过整合传感监测和机器人干预，利用先进AI技术构建闭环系统，有望实现更有效的帕金森病个性化管理和康复。

Abstract: The current body of research on Parkinson's disease (PD) screening, monitoring, and management has evolved along two largely independent trajectories. The first research community focuses on multimodal sensing of PD-related biomarkers using noninvasive technologies such as inertial measurement units (IMUs), force/pressure insoles, electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), speech and acoustic analysis, and RGB/RGB-D motion capture systems. These studies emphasize data acquisition, feature extraction, and machine learning-based classification for PD screening, diagnosis, and disease progression modeling. In parallel, a second research community has concentrated on robotic intervention and rehabilitation, employing socially assistive robots (SARs), robot-assisted rehabilitation (RAR) systems, and virtual reality (VR)-integrated robotic platforms for improving motor and cognitive function, enhancing social engagement, and supporting caregivers. Despite the complementary goals of these two domains, their methodological and technological integration remains limited, with minimal data-level or decision-level coupling between the two. With the advent of advanced artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), agentic AI systems, a unique opportunity now exists to unify these research streams. We envision a closed-loop sensor-AI-robot framework in which multimodal sensing continuously guides the interaction between the patient, caregiver, humanoid robot (and physician) through AI agents that are powered by a multitude of AI models such as robotic and wearables foundation models, LLM-based reasoning, reinforcement learning, and continual learning. Such closed-loop system enables personalized, explainable, and context-aware intervention, forming the basis for digital twin of the PD patient that can adapt over time to deliver intelligent, patient-centered PD care.

Main category: eess.SP

Conclusion: 提出的在线学习框架为DNN接收器在动态无线环境中的实际部署提供了有效的解决方案，平衡了性能与计算复杂度。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based receivers offer a powerful alternative to classical model-based designs for wireless communication, especially in complex and nonlinear propagation environments. However, their adoption is challenged by the rapid variability of wireless channels, which makes pre-trained static DNN-based receivers ineffective, and by the latency and computational burden of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based learning. In this work, we propose an online learning framework that enables rapid low-complexity adaptation of DNN-based receivers. Our approach is based on two main tenets. First, we cast online learning as Bayesian tracking in parameter space, enabling a single-step adaptation, which deviates from multi-epoch SGD . Second, we focus on modular DNN architectures that enable parallel, online, and localized variational Bayesian updates. Simulations with practical communication channels demonstrate that our proposed online learning framework can maintain a low error rate with markedly reduced update latency and increased robustness to channel dynamics as compared to traditional gradient descent based method.

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段定位方法能够有效减轻轨道误差对LEO卫星定位的影响，实现米级精度的定位性能。

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites offer a promising alternative to global navigation satellite systems for precise positioning; however, their relatively low altitudes make them more susceptible to orbital perturbations, which in turn degrade positioning accuracy. In this work, we study LEO-based positioning under orbital errors within a signal-of-opportunity framework. First, we introduce a LEO orbit model that accounts for Earth's non-sphericity and derive a wideband communication model that captures fast- and slow-time Doppler effects and multipath propagation. Subsequently, we perform a misspecified Cramér-Rao bound (MCRB) analysis to evaluate the impact of orbital errors on positioning performance. Then, we propose a two-stage positioning method starting with a (i) MCRB-based weighted orbit calibration, followed by (ii) least-squares user positioning using the corrected orbit. The MCRB analysis indicates that orbital errors can induce kilometer-level position biases. Extensive simulations show that the proposed estimator can considerably enhance the positioning accuracy relative to the orbit-mismatched baseline, yielding errors on the order of a few meters.

### [8] [Hierarchically Block-Sparse Recovery With Prior Support Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06173)
*Liyang Lu,Haochen Wu,Wenbo Xu,Zhaocheng Wang,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于先验支撑信息（PSI）的分层压缩感知（HCS）恢复边界，设计了HiBOMP-P算法，并推导了基于互不相干性（MIP）的精确恢复条件，证明HCS在PSI与真实支撑集不重叠时仍能提升恢复性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于先验支撑信息的方法严重依赖先验信息与真实支撑集的重叠，当这种重叠不存在时性能会下降。本文旨在开发一种更鲁棒的分层压缩感知方法，即使先验信息不准确也能提升恢复性能。

Method: 设计了分层块正交匹配追踪与PSI（HiBOMP-P）算法，采用递归形式可靠恢复分层块稀疏信号；提出了分层MIP概念，并推导了精确恢复条件和可重构稀疏度水平。

Result: 证明了HCS在PSI与真实支撑集不重叠时仍能提供改进的恢复性能，而现有方法在这种情况下性能会受损；提出了噪声场景下的可靠恢复条件和稀疏度非零时的最优分层结构。

Conclusion: 分层压缩感知方法相比现有方法具有更好的鲁棒性，不依赖先验信息与真实支撑集的精确匹配，为压缩感知应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We provide new recovery bounds for hierarchical compressed sensing (HCS) based on prior support information (PSI). A detailed PSI-enabled reconstruction model is formulated using various forms of PSI. The hierarchical block orthogonal matching pursuit with PSI (HiBOMP-P) algorithm is designed in a recursive form to reliably recover hierarchically block-sparse signals. We derive exact recovery conditions (ERCs) measured by the mutual incoherence property (MIP), wherein hierarchical MIP concepts are proposed, and further develop reconstructible sparsity levels to reveal sufficient conditions for ERCs. Leveraging these MIP analyses, we present several extended insights, including reliable recovery conditions in noisy scenarios and the optimal hierarchical structure for cases where sparsity is not equal to zero. Our results further confirm that HCS offers improved recovery performance even when the prior information does not overlap with the true support set, whereas existing methods heavily rely on this overlap, thereby compromising performance if it is absent.

### [9] [Meta-Learning-Driven GFlowNets for 3D Directional Modulation in Mobile Wireless Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06188)
*Zhihao Tao,Athina P. Petropulu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种Meta-GFlowNet框架，通过元学习实现GFlowNets在动态无线环境中的快速适应，解决了传统GFlowNets在移动网络中适用性受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GFlowNets假设静态环境，限制了其在移动无线网络中的应用，需要开发能够快速适应动态条件的框架。

Method: 使用模型无关元学习，通过内部轨迹平衡更新和外部元更新学习跨用户方向的通用先验，采用伪监督一致性目标结合GFlowNet学习奖励和实际系统奖励。

Conclusion: 该框架为动态无线环境提供了高效的生成式AI解决方案，可扩展到其他移动无线系统如联合感知通信网络。

Abstract: In our prior work we have proposed the use of GFlowNets, a generative AI (GenAI) framework, for designing a secure communication system comprising a time-modulated intelligent reflecting surface (TM-IRS). However, GFlowNet-based approaches assume static environments, limiting their applicability in mobile wireless networks. In this paper, we proposes a novel Meta-GFlowNet framework that achieves rapid adaptation to dynamic conditions using model-agnostic meta-learning. As the communication user is moving, the framework learns a direction-general prior across user directions via inner trajectory-balance updates and outer meta-updates, enabling quick convergence to new user directions. The approach requires no labeled data, employing a pseudo-supervised consistency objective derived from the learned reward by GFlowNet and the actual sum-rate reward of the TM-IRS system. Simulation results show that the proposed method attains faster adaptation and higher secrecy performance than retrained GFlowNets, offering an efficient GenAI framework for dynamic wireless environments. Although the scenario considered here focuses on directional modulation-based physical-layer security, the proposed framework can also be applied to other mobile wireless systems, such as joint sensing-communication networks, that utilize GFlowNets.

*Yimeng Lin,Nan Wang,Daniel Abraham,Daniel Polak,Xiaozhi Cao,Stephen Cauley,Kawin Setsompop*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Mobile-GRAPPA是一种k空间"清理"方法，使用局部GRAPPA算子去除运动和dB0相关伪影，使数据能够用标准SENSE重建，显著降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动导航技术能够快速跟踪运动和dB0诱导相位，但将这些高时间分辨率信息准确整合到SENSE重建中计算成本过高。

Method: 通过轻量级多层感知器(MLP)高效训练k空间位置特定的Mobile-GRAPPA核，并在整个k空间应用这些核来生成干净数据。

Result: 在高度运动污染的1mm全脑GRE和EPTI数据上，Mobile-GRAPPA实现了准确重建且时间开销可忽略，而完整Aligned-SENSE重建时间过长（GRE>10小时，EPTI>10天）。

Conclusion: Mobile-GRAPPA能够以最小计算开销将详细运动和dB0跟踪整合到SENSE中，实现对挑战性数据的快速高质量重建。

Abstract: Advanced motion navigations now enable rapid tracking of subject motion and dB0-induced phase, but accurately incorporating this high-temporal-resolution information into SENSE (Aligned-SENSE) is often computationally prohibitive. We propose "Mobile-GRAPPA", a k-space "cleaning" approach that uses local GRAPPA operators to remove motion and dB0 related corruption so that the resulting data can be reconstructed with standard SENSE. We efficiently train a family of k-space-position-specific Mobile-GRAPPA kernels via a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) and apply them across k-space to generate clean data. In experiments on highly motion-corrupted 1-mm whole-brain GRE (Tacq = 10 min; 1,620 motion/dB0 trackings) and EPTI (Tacq = 2 min; 544 trackings), Mobile-GRAPPA enabled accurate reconstruction with negligible time penalty, whereas full Aligned-SENSE was impractical (reconstruction times > 10 h for GRE and > 10 days for EPTI). These results show that Mobile-GRAPPA incorporates detailed motion and dB0 tracking into SENSE with minimal computational overhead, enabling fast, high-quality reconstructions of challenging data.

Abstract: This paper proposes a blocker-aware multicarrier integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-non orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, leveraging hybrid beamforming and dynamic power allocation to enhance spectrum efficiency in 6G networks. Recognizing the performance degradation caused by environmental blockers, the system introduces a joint waveform design that ensures robust operation under varying channel conditions. A channel switching mechanism is deployed to reroute communication through alternative non-line-of-sight paths when the primary line-of-sight links are obstructed. Moreover, a dynamic power allocation strategy enforces a minimum rate constraint for the weak NOMA user, ensuring consistent quality of service. Extensive simulations over multiple blockage scenarios and signal to noise (SNR) conditions validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Notably, under severe blockage, the system achieves up to a 400% sensing rate enhancement at 15 dB SNR, with only a 20% reduction in communication rate. These results corroborate the system's ability to adapt and optimize joint sensing-communication performance in practical deployment environments.

Abstract: Balancing throughput and fairness promises to be a key enabler for achieving large-scale digital inclusion in future vertical heterogeneous networks (VHetNets). In an attempt to address the global digital divide problem, this paper explores a multi-high-altitude platform system (HAPS)-ground integrated network, in which multiple HAPSs collaborate with ground base stations (BSs) to enhance the users' quality of service on the ground to achieve the highly sought-after digital equity. To this end, this paper considers maximizing both the network-wide weighted sum rate function and the worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) function subject to the same system level constraints. More specifically, the paper tackles the two different optimization problems so as to balance throughput and fairness, by accounting for the individual HAPS payload connectivity constraints, HAPS and BS distinct power limitations, and per-user rate requirements. This paper solves the considered problems using techniques from optimization theory by adopting a generalized assignment problem (GAP)-based methodology to determine the user association variables, jointly with successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithms for optimizing the corresponding beamforming vectors. One of the main advantages of the proposed algorithms is their amenability for distributed implementation across the multiple HAPSs and BSs. The simulation results particularly validate the performance of the presented algorithms, demonstrating the capability of multi-HAPS networks to boost-up the overall network digital inclusion toward democratizing future digital services.

Abstract: The increasing saturation of terrestrial resources has driven economic activities into low-altitude airspace. These activities, such as air taxis, rely on low-altitude wireless networks, and one key enabling technology is integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, in low-altitude airspace, ISAC is vulnerable to channel-access attacks, thereby degrading performance and threatening safety. To address this, we propose a defense framework based on a Stackelberg game. Specifically, we first model the system under attack, deriving metrics for the communication and the sensing to quantify performance. Then, we formulate the interaction as a three-player game where a malicious attacker acts as the leader, while the legitimate drone and ground base station act as followers. Using a backward induction algorithm, we obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium, allowing the defenders to dynamically adjust their strategies to mitigate the attack. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm converges to a stable solution and outperforms existing baselines, ensuring reliable ISAC performance for critical low-altitude applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多组多播波束成形需要高计算复杂度和CSI反馈开销，同时干扰管理和波束成形优化会导致显著的速率损失。

Method: 采用CSIT-free预编码和基于最大最小公平的闭式功率分配，让用户能够完全消除组间干扰检测多播流。

Result: 仿真结果显示，在可实现速率和组内用户增加方面，所提CF-MGM方案优于现有基于CSIT的方法，具有优越性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: CF-MGM方案有效解决了毫米波系统中多组多播传输的CSIT获取复杂性问题，实现了低复杂度的干扰消除和性能提升。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the downlink multi-group multicast (MGM) transmission problem in overloaded mmWave systems. In particular, the conventional MGM beamforming requires substantial computational complexity and feedback (or pilot) overhead for acquisition of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), while simultaneous interference management and multicast beamforming optimization across multi-group inevitably incurs a significant rate loss. To address this, we propose a CSIT-free MGM (CF-MGM) transmission that eliminates the need for a complex CSIT acquisition. A deterministic CSIT-free precoding and proposed closed-form power allocation based on max-min fairness (MMF) allow each user to detect the common multicast stream completely canceling the inter-group interference with a significantly low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority and scalability of the proposed CF-MGM for the achievable rate and increase of users in a group outperforming the existing CSIT-based methods.

Result: 增加模块间距可以扩大有效孔径并降低横向速度的CRB，而径向速度CRB对间距不敏感；横向速度误差比径向速度误差导致更严重的性能下降；预测波束成形与MLA在目标跟踪中保持高定位精度。

Abstract: Velocity estimation is a cornerstone of recently introduced near-field predictive beamforming. This paper derives the closed-form Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint velocity estimation using a modular linear array (MLA) within a predictive-beamforming framework. The analysis shows that increasing inter-module separation enlarges the effective aperture and reduces the transverse-velocity CRB, whereas the radial-velocity CRB is largely insensitive to separation. We further obtain a simple closed-form relation linking the achievable antenna savings to the inter-module separation while preserving the same transverse accuracy of a uniform linear array (ULA). We further investigate how velocity mismatch affects array gain and show that transverse-velocity errors cause more severe performance degradation than radial-velocity errors. Simulations show that predictive beamforming with MLAs maintains high localization accuracy for target tracking.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to assist covert communication between a low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite and a ground user under the surveillance of a passive warden. The UAV simultaneously serves its own ground network and acts as a friendly jammer to enhance the covertness of satellite transmissions. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the warden's average minimum detection error probability which is then used to define the covert constraint. Building on this, we formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the UAV's 3D placement, its power allocation, and the satellite's transmit power to maximize the system's covert rate. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, we propose an algorithm based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, and further develop a Dinkelbach's algorithm for a special case. Numerical results validate the tightness of the derived bound and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in configuring optimal system parameters.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the 3D positioning capabilities of users in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Unlike previous studies that mainly rely on idealized isotropic antenna models, we adopt a polarimetric model that takes advantage of effective aperture distribution functions to characterize realistic antenna patterns, placements, and polarization effects. Based on this model, we analyze the fundamental limits of UE positioning using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the position error bound (PEB). The FIM is shown to be expressed as a weighted sum of the information contributions from individual access point (AP)-UE pairs, with each contribution interpreted geometrically across distance, azimuth, and elevation dimensions. The impact of the UE tilt and the spatial distribution of APs on the PEBs is further analyzed. As a further advancement, we propose a complete positioning framework from a UE tracking perspective. By integrating a global probability hypothesis density filter and a PEB-aware AP management strategy, the framework enables accurate tracking while optimizing AP scheduling. Finally, we present a distributed MIMO channel measurement campaign to validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrate a centimeter-level tracking accuracy. In addition, the PEB-aware AP management strategy is shown to maintain robust tracking performance while significantly reducing the number of concurrently active APs, thus lowering the overall system overhead.

Conclusion: 结合频谱信息的SaPINNs框架为自然激励下的系统辨识提供了有效解决方案，通过频谱先验引入归纳偏置，显著提升估计性能。

Abstract: System identification under unknown external excitation is an inherently ill-posed problem, typically requiring additional knowledge or simplifying assumptions to enable reliable state and parameter estimation. The difficulty of the problem is further amplified in structural systems subjected to natural hazards such as earthquakes or windstorms, where responses are often highly transient, nonlinear, and spatially distributed. To address this challenge, we introduce Spectrum and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SaPINNs) for efficient input--state--parameter estimation in systems under complex excitations characteristic of natural hazards. The proposed model enhances the neural network with governing physics of the system dynamics and incorporates spectral information of natural hazards by using empirically derived spectra as priors on the unknown excitations. This integration improves inference of unmeasured inputs, system states, and parameters without imposing restrictive assumptions on their dynamics. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated through comparative studies on both linear and nonlinear systems under various types of excitation, including the El Centro earthquake, where the seismic spectrum is assumed to be not precisely known. To account for predictive uncertainty, the proposed architecture is embedded within a Deep Ensemble (DEns) networks architecture, providing distributions over possible solutions. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional PINNs, as the incorporation of spectral information introduces an inductive bias that guides the network more effectively through the solution space and enhances its ability to recover physically consistent state and parameter estimates with realistic uncertainty levels.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel structure-aware matrix completion framework assisted by radial basis function (RBF) interpolation for near-field radio map construction in extremely large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. Unlike the far-field scenario, near-field wavefronts exhibit strong dependencies on both angle and distance due to spherical wave propagation, leading to complicated variations in received signal strength (RSS). To effectively capture the intricate spatial variations structure inherent in near-field environments, a regularized RBF interpolation method is developed to enhance radio map reconstruction accuracy. Leveraging theoretical insights from interpolation error analysis of RBF, an inverse μ-law-inspired nonuniform sampling strategy is introduced to allocate measurements adaptively, emphasizing regions with rapid RSS variations near the transmitter. To further exploit the global low-rank structure in the near-field radio map, we integrate RBF interpolation with nuclear norm minimization (NNM)-based matrix completion. A robust Huberized leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) scheme is then proposed for adaptive selection of the tolerance parameter, facilitating optimal fusion between RBF interpolation and matrix completion. The integration of local variation structure modeling via RBF interpolation and global low-rank structure exploitation via matrix completion yields a structure-aware framework that substantially improves the accuracy of near-field radio map reconstruction. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves over 10% improvement in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to standard interpolation and matrix completion methods under varying sampling densities and shadowing conditions.

Abstract: Edge AI, which brings artificial intelligence to the edge of the network for real-time processing and decision-making, has emerged as a transformative technology across various applications. However, the deployment of Edge AI systems faces significant challenges due to high energy consumption and extended operation time.
  In this paper, we consider an Edge AI system which integrates the data acquisition, computation and communication processes, and focus on improving learning performance of this system. We model the time and energy consumption of different processes and perform a rigorous convergence analysis to quantify the impact of key system parameters, such as the amount of collected data and the number of training rounds, on the learning performance. Based on this analysis, we formulate a system-wide optimization problem that seeks to maximize learning performance under given time and energy constraints.

Abstract: Future Internet-of-Things networks are envisioned to use small and cheap sensor nodes with extremely low power consumption to avoid the extensive use of batteries. To provide connectivity to a massive number of these nodes, backscatter communication (BC) is emerging as an energy- and cost-efficient technology exploiting the reflection of radio frequency signals. However, challenges such as round-trip path loss and direct link interference (DLI) between the carrier emitter and the reader limit its performance. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a joint access point role selection and a novel beamforming technique for bistatic BC in a distributed multiple-input multiple- output setup. The proposed approach boosts the received backscattered energy while effectively mitigating DLI, thereby reducing the error probability. We also propose a channel estimation method tailored to operate under DLI conditions and propose a mismatch detector using estimated channel coefficients. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability of error for the detectors and model the quantization noise caused by DLI. Finally, comprehensive simulation results show that the proposed method with 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) effectively mitigates DLI, reduces the quantization noise, and enhances backscattered signal energy, achieving performance comparable to the benchmark scenario with 8-bit ADCs.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems demand precise and efficient target localization, a task challenged by rich multipath propagation in complex wireless environments. This paper introduces MARBLE-Net (Multipath-Aware Rainbow Beam Learning Network), a deep learning framework that jointly optimizes the analog beamforming parameters of a frequency-dependent rainbow beam and a neural localization network for high-accuracy position estimation. By treating the phase-shifter (PS) and true-time-delay (TTD) parameters as learnable weights, the system adaptively refines its sensing beam to exploit environment-specific multipath characteristics. A structured multi-stage training strategy is proposed to ensure stable convergence and effective end-to-end optimization. Simulation results show that MARBLE-Net outperforms both a fixed-beam deep learning baseline (RaiNet) and a traditional k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method, reducing localization error by more than 50\% in a multipath-rich scene. Moreover, the results reveal a nuanced interaction with multipath propagation: while confined uni-directional multipath degrades accuracy, structured and directional multipath can be effectively exploited to achieve performance surpassing even line-of-sight (LoS) conditions.

Abstract: The proliferation of wireless devices necessitates more robust and reliable emitter detection and identification for critical tasks such as spectrum management and network security. Existing studies exploring methods for unknown emitters identification, however, are typically hindered by their dependence on labeled or proprietary datasets, unrealistic assumptions (e.g. all samples with identical transmitted messages), or deficiency of systematic evaluations across different architectures and design dimensions. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of unknown emitter detection systems across key aspects of the design space, focusing on data modality, learning approaches, and feature learn- ing modules. We demonstrate that prior self-supervised, zero-shot emitter detection approaches commonly use datasets with identical transmitted messages. To address this limitation, we propose a 2D- Constellation data modality for scenarios with varying messages, achieving up to a 40\% performance improvement in ROC-AUC, NMI, and F1 metrics compared to conventional raw I/Q data. Furthermore, we introduce interpretable Kolmogorov--Arnold Net- works (KANs) to enhance model transparency, and a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based initialization procedure for feature learning modules operating on sparse 2D-Constellation data, which improves the performance of Deep Clustering approaches by up to 40\% across the same metrics comparing to the modules without SVD initialization. We evaluate all data modalities and learning modules across three learning approaches: Deep Clustering, Auto Encoder and Contrastive Learning.

Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) is rapidly emerging as a key driver of innovation, encompassing economic activities taking place in airspace below 500 meters. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide valuable tools for logistics collection within LAE systems, offering the ability to navigate through complex environments, avoid obstacles, and improve operational efficiency. However, logistics collection tasks involve UAVs flying through complex three-dimensional (3D) environments while avoiding obstacles, where traditional UAV trajectory design methods,typically developed under free-space conditions without explicitly accounting for obstacles, are not applicable. This paper presents, we propose a novel algorithm that combines the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) methods to minimize the total collection time. Specifically, the LKH algorithm determines the optimal order of item collection, while the DDPG algorithm designs the flight trajectory between collection points. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed LKH-DDPG algorithm significantly reduces collection time by approximately 49 percent compared to baseline approaches, thereby highlighting its effectiveness in optimizing UAV trajectories and enhancing operational efficiency for logistics collection tasks in the LAE paradigm.

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient delivery of common content to multiple user equipments (UEs) has motivated significant research in physical-layer multicasting. By exploiting the beamforming capabilities of massive MIMO, multicasting provides a spectrum-efficient solution that avoids unnecessary intra-group interference. A key challenge, however, is solving the max-min fair (MMF) and quality-of-service (QoS) multicast beamforming optimization problems, which are NP-hard due to the non-convex structure and the requirement for rank-1 solutions. Traditional approaches based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) followed by randomization exhibit poor scalability with system size, while state-of-the-art successive convex approximation (SCA) methods only guarantee convergence to stationary points. In this paper, we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based framework for MMF and QoS multicast beamforming in cell-free massive MIMO networks. The algorithm leverages SDR but incorporates a novel iterative elimination strategy within the ADMM updates to efficiently obtain near-global optimal rank-1 beamforming solutions with reduced computational complexity compared to standard SDP solvers and randomization methods. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ADMM-based procedure not only achieves superior spectral efficiency but also scales favorably with the number of antennas and UEs compared to state-of-the-art SCA-based algorithms, making it a practical tool for next-generation multicast systems.

Conclusion: 通过将ORBGRAND-AI集成到GCD中作为模式生成器，并利用信道相关性，可以在减少计算复杂度的同时显著提高解码性能。

Abstract: There have been significant advances in recent years in the development of forward error correction decoders that can decode codes of any structure, including practical realizations in synthesized circuits and taped out chips. While essentially all soft-decision decoders assume that bits have been impacted independently on the channel, for one of these new approaches it has been established that channel dependencies can be exploited to achieve superior decoding accuracy, resulting in Ordered Reliability Bits Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding Approximate Independence (ORBGRAND-AI). Building on that capability, here we consider the integration of ORBGRAND-AI as a pattern generator for Guessing Codeword Decoding (GCD). We first establish that a direct approach delivers mildly degraded block error rate (BLER) but with reduced number of queried patterns when compared to ORBGRAND-AI. We then show that with a more nuanced approach it is possible to leverage total correlation to deliver an additional BLER improvement of around 0.75 dB while retaining reduced query numbers.

Abstract: Depression is a major cause of global mental illness and significantly influences suicide rates. Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive and accessible method for examining cerebral activity and identifying disease-associated patterns. We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework, named Edge-gated, axis-mixed Pooling Attention Network (ExPANet), for differentiating major depressive disorder (MDD) patients from healthy controls (HC). EEG recordings undergo preprocessing to eliminate artifacts and are segmented into short periods of activity. We extract 14 features from each segment, which include time, frequency, fractal, and complexity domains. Electrodes are represented as nodes, whereas edges are determined by the phase-locking value (PLV) to represent functional connectivity. The generated brain graphs are examined utilizing an adapted graph attention network. This architecture acquires both localized electrode characteristics and comprehensive functional connectivity patterns. The proposed framework attains superior performance relative to current EEG-based approaches across two different datasets. A fundamental advantage of our methodology is its explainability. We evaluated the significance of features, channels, and edges, in addition to intrinsic attention weights. These studies highlight features, cerebral areas, and connectivity associations that are especially relevant to MDD, many of which correspond with clinical data. Our findings demonstrate a reliable and transparent method for EEG-based screening of MDD, using deep learning with clinically relevant results.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (Graph-based RAG) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured knowledge. However, existing methods face three critical challenges: Inaccurate Graph Construction, caused by LLM hallucination; Poor Reasoning Ability, caused by failing to generate explicit reasons telling LLM why certain chunks were selected; and Inadequate Answering, which only partially answers the query due to the inadequate LLM reasoning, making their performance lag behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks. To address these issues, we propose AGRAG, an advanced graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework. When constructing the graph, AGRAG substitutes the widely used LLM entity extraction method with a statistics-based method, avoiding hallucination and error propagation. When retrieval, AGRAG formulates the graph reasoning procedure as the Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem, where we try to include more nodes with high influence score, but with less involving edge cost, to make the generated reasoning paths more comprehensive. We prove this problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. The MCMI subgraph generated can serve as explicit reasoning paths to tell LLM why certain chunks were retrieved, thereby making the LLM better focus on the query-related part contents of the chunks, reducing the impact of noise, and improving AGRAG's reasoning ability. Furthermore, compared with the simple tree-structured reasoning paths, our MCMI subgraph can allow more complex graph structures, such as cycles, and improve the comprehensiveness of the generated reasoning paths.

Conclusion: 通过整合时间序列相似性度量和机器学习预测，本研究提供了将低频宏观经济指标转换为高频可操作信号的新框架，为政策制定者提供实时监测工具。

Abstract: The policy environment of countries changes rapidly, influencing macro-level indicators such as the Energy Security Index. However, this index is only reported annually, limiting its responsiveness to short-term fluctuations. To address this gap, the present study introduces a daily proxy for the Energy Security Index and applies it to forecast energy security at a daily frequency.The study employs a two stage approach first, a suitable daily proxy for the annual Energy Security Index is identified by applying six time series similarity measures to key energy related variables. Second, the selected proxy is modeled using the XGBoost algorithm to generate 15 day ahead forecasts, enabling high frequency monitoring of energy security dynamics.As the result of proxy choosing, Volume Brent consistently emerged as the most suitable proxy across the majority of methods. The model demonstrated strong performance, with an R squared of 0.981 on the training set and 0.945 on the test set, and acceptable error metrics . The 15 day forecast of Brent volume indicates short term fluctuations, with a peak around day 4, a decline until day 8, a rise near day 10, and a downward trend toward day 15, accompanied by prediction intervals.By integrating time series similarity measures with machine learning based forecasting, this study provides a novel framework for converting low frequency macroeconomic indicators into high frequency, actionable signals. The approach enables real time monitoring of the Energy Security Index, offering policymakers and analysts a scalable and practical tool to respond more rapidly to fast changing policy and market conditions, especially in data scarce environments.

Motivation: 解决Volterra级数识别高维非线性动力系统时面临的维度诅咒问题，特别是现有Tensor Network方法如MVMALS仍存在计算和内存瓶颈。

Conclusion: THA为识别以前难以处理的高维系统提供了一种可扩展且理论上有依据的方法。

Abstract: The identification of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems via the Volterra series has significant potential, but has been severely hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Tensor Network (TN) methods such as the Modified Alternating Linear Scheme (MVMALS) have been a breakthrough for the field, offering a tractable approach by exploiting the low-rank structure in Volterra kernels. However, these techniques still encounter prohibitive computational and memory bottlenecks due to high-order polynomial scaling with respect to input dimension. To overcome this barrier, we introduce the Tensor Head Averaging (THA) algorithm, which significantly reduces complexity by constructing an ensemble of localized MVMALS models trained on small subsets of the input space. In this paper, we present a theoretical foundation for the THA algorithm. We establish observable, finite-sample bounds on the error between the THA ensemble and a full MVMALS model, and we derive an exact decomposition of the squared error. This decomposition is used to analyze the manner in which subset models implicitly compensate for omitted dynamics. We quantify this effect, and prove that correlation between the included and omitted dynamics creates an optimization incentive which drives THA's performance toward accuracy superior to a simple truncation of a full MVMALS model. THA thus offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for identifying previously intractable high-dimensional systems.

TL;DR: 提出了多样化流匹配（DFM），一种基于ODE的框架，用于解决多样化分布匹配（DDM）问题，首次实现基于ODE的翻译可识别性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DDM方法只能使用GAN实现的问题，GAN训练不稳定且无法提供传输轨迹信息，而轨迹信息在单细胞进化分析和机器人路径规划等应用中很重要。

Method: 提出基于双层优化的训练损失、非线性插值和结构重构，将流匹配（FM）适应到DDM框架中，学习翻译函数的速率而非翻译函数本身。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DFM是首个基于ODE且保证翻译可识别性的方法，为DDM提供了更稳定且能提供轨迹信息的实现方案。

Abstract: Diversified distribution matching (DDM) finds a unified translation function mapping a diverse collection of conditional source distributions to their target counterparts. DDM was proposed to resolve content misalignment issues in unpaired domain translation, achieving translation identifiability. However, DDM has only been implemented using GANs due to its constraints on the translation function. GANs are often unstable to train and do not provide the transport trajectory information -- yet such trajectories are useful in applications such as single-cell evolution analysis and robot route planning. This work introduces diversified flow matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework for DDM. Adapting flow matching (FM) to enforce a unified translation function as in DDM is challenging, as FM learns the translation function's velocity rather than the translation function itself. A custom bilevel optimization-based training loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and a structural reformulation are proposed to address these challenges, offering a tangible implementation. To our knowledge, DFM is the first ODE-based approach guaranteeing translation identifiability. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the proposed method.

Conclusion: IterRef证明了在离散扩散模型中通过奖励引导的测试时缩放的有效性，能够渐进地将中间状态导向最优分布。

Abstract: Test-time scaling through reward-guided generation remains largely unexplored for discrete diffusion models despite its potential as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce Iterative Reward-Guided Refinement (IterRef), a novel test-time scaling method tailored to discrete diffusion that leverages reward-guided noising-denoising transitions to progressively refine misaligned intermediate states. We formalize this process within a Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) framework, proving convergence to the reward-aligned distribution. Unlike prior methods that assume the current state is already aligned with the reward distribution and only guide the subsequent transition, our approach explicitly refines each state in situ, progressively steering it toward the optimal intermediate distribution. Across both text and image domains, we evaluate IterRef on diverse discrete diffusion models and observe consistent improvements in reward-guided generation quality. In particular, IterRef achieves striking gains under low compute budgets, far surpassing prior state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM)方法，通过路径生成器和验证器的耦合，优化掩码扩散模型的解码顺序选择，提高生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于置信度的启发式采样方法存在短视问题，无法利用额外计算资源，且早期解码错误会级联传播，需要更智能的采样策略

Method: 将采样重新表述为对所有可能解掩顺序的路径选择，包含路径生成器（从解掩集合池中采样提出路径）和验证器（计算路径不确定性并进行重要性采样）

Result: 在数学、规划和编程等六个基准测试中均取得一致性能提升，仅需2-3条路径即可达到峰值性能，显著提升了LLaDA和LLaDA 1.5模型表现

Conclusion: 基于不确定性的验证为强化学习提供了正交收益，展示了该框架的通用性，LookUM能够有效避免错误倾向的解码轨迹

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) as language models generate by iteratively unmasking tokens, yet their performance crucially depends on the inference time order of unmasking. Prevailing heuristics, such as confidence based sampling, are myopic: they optimize locally, fail to leverage extra test-time compute, and let early decoding mistakes cascade. We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements. LookUM requires only two to three paths to achieve peak performance, demonstrating remarkably efficient path selection. The consistent improvements on both LLaDA and post-trained LLaDA 1.5 are particularly striking: base LLaDA with LookUM rivals the performance of RL-tuned LLaDA 1.5, while LookUM further enhances LLaDA 1.5 itself showing that uncertainty based verification provides orthogonal benefits to reinforcement learning and underscoring the versatility of our framework. Code will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经验风险最小化在分布偏移和少数子群体上可靠性差，传统DRO方法依赖单一全局鲁棒性预算，导致模型过于保守或鲁棒性分配不当。

Method: 基于方差驱动的自适应样本级DRO框架，使用KL散度式约束限制对抗权重与经验权重的比例，形成线性内最大化问题，采用注水算法高效求解，引入预热阶段和线性调度稳定训练。

Conclusion: Var-DRO是无监督、易于实现、理论可靠且计算高效的框架，能有效提升模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Distribution shifts and minority subpopulations frequently undermine the reliability of deep neural networks trained using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this by optimizing for the worst-case risk within a neighborhood of the training distribution. However, conventional methods depend on a single, global robustness budget, which can lead to overly conservative models or a misallocation of robustness. We propose a variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level DRO (Var-DRO) framework that automatically identifies high-risk training samples and assigns a personalized robustness budget to each based on its online loss variance. Our formulation employs two-sided, KL-divergence-style bounds to constrain the ratio between adversarial and empirical weights for every sample. This results in a linear inner maximization problem over a convex polytope, which admits an efficient water-filling solution. To stabilize training, we introduce a warmup phase and a linear ramp schedule for the global cap on per-sample budgets, complemented by label smoothing for numerical robustness. Evaluated on CIFAR-10-C (corruptions), our method achieves the highest overall mean accuracy compared to ERM and KL-DRO. On Waterbirds, Var-DRO improves overall performance while matching or surpassing KL-DRO. On the original CIFAR-10 dataset, Var-DRO remains competitive, exhibiting the modest trade-off anticipated when prioritizing robustness. The proposed framework is unsupervised (requiring no group labels), straightforward to implement, theoretically sound, and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of jet fuel demand is crucial for optimizing supply chain operations in the aviation market. Fuel distributors specifically require precise estimates to avoid inventory shortages or excesses. However, there is a lack of studies that analyze the jet fuel demand forecasting problem using machine learning models. Instead, many industry practitioners rely on deterministic or expertise-based models. In this research, we evaluate the performance of data-driven approaches using a substantial amount of data obtained from a major aviation fuel distributor in the Danish market. Our analysis compares the predictive capabilities of traditional time series models, Prophet, LSTM sequence-to-sequence neural networks, and hybrid models. A key challenge in developing these models is the required forecasting horizon, as fuel demand needs to be predicted for the next 30 days to optimize sourcing strategies. To ensure the reliability of the data-driven approaches and provide valuable insights to practitioners, we analyze three different datasets. The primary objective of this study is to present a comprehensive case study on jet fuel demand forecasting, demonstrating the advantages of employing data-driven models and highlighting the impact of incorporating additional variables in the predictive models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in tasks like visual question answering and multimodal text generation, but their effectiveness in scientific domains such as materials science remains limited. While some machine learning methods have addressed specific challenges in this field, there is still a lack of foundation models designed for broad tasks like polymer property prediction using multimodal data. In this work, we present a multimodal polymer dataset to fine-tune VLMs through instruction-tuning pairs and assess the impact of multimodality on prediction performance. Our fine-tuned models, using LoRA, outperform unimodal and baseline approaches, demonstrating the benefits of multimodal learning. Additionally, this approach reduces the need to train separate models for different properties, lowering deployment and maintenance costs.

Abstract: Real-Time Auction (RTA) Interception aims to filter out invalid or irrelevant traffic to enhance the integrity and reliability of downstream data. However, two key challenges remain: (i) the need for accurate estimation of traffic quality together with sufficiently high confidence in the model's predictions, typically addressed through uncertainty modeling, and (ii) the efficiency bottlenecks that such uncertainty modeling introduces in real-time applications due to repeated inference. To address these challenges, we propose DAUM, a joint modeling framework that integrates multi-objective learning with uncertainty modeling, yielding both traffic quality predictions and reliable confidence estimates. Building on DAUM, we further apply knowledge distillation to reduce the computational overhead of uncertainty modeling, while largely preserving predictive accuracy and retaining the benefits of uncertainty estimation. Experiments on the JD advertisement dataset demonstrate that DAUM consistently improves predictive performance, with the distilled model delivering a tenfold increase in inference speed.

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, its theoretical understanding of representation learning remains limited. Deep neural kernels provide a principled framework to interpret over-parameterized neural networks by mapping hierarchical feature transformations into kernel spaces, thereby combining the expressive power of deep architectures with the analytical tractability of kernel methods. Recent advances, particularly neural tangent kernels (NTKs) derived by gradient inner products, have established connections between infinitely wide neural networks and nonparametric Bayesian inference. However, the existing NTK paradigm has been predominantly confined to the infinite-width regime, while overlooking the representational role of network depth. To address this gap, we propose a depth-induced NTK kernel based on a shortcut-related architecture, which converges to a Gaussian process as the network depth approaches infinity. We theoretically analyze the training invariance and spectrum properties of the proposed kernel, which stabilizes the kernel dynamics and mitigates degeneration. Experimental results further underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our findings significantly extend the existing landscape of the neural kernel theory and provide an in-depth understanding of deep learning and the scaling law.

Abstract: We study the problem of worst case regret in piecewise stationary multi armed bandits. While the minimax theory for stationary bandits is well established, understanding analogous limits in time-varying settings is challenging. Existing lower bounds rely on what we refer to as infrequent sampling arguments, where long intervals without exploration allow adversarial reward changes that induce large regret.
  In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different approach based on a belief inertia argument. Our analysis captures how an algorithm's empirical beliefs, encoded through historical reward averages, create momentum that resists new evidence after a change. We show how this inertia can be exploited to construct adversarial instances that mislead classical algorithms such as Explore Then Commit, epsilon greedy, and UCB, causing them to suffer regret that grows linearly with T and with a substantial constant factor, regardless of how their parameters are tuned, even with a single change point.
  We extend the analysis to algorithms that periodically restart to handle non stationarity and prove that, even then, the worst case regret remains linear in T. Our results indicate that utilizing belief inertia can be a powerful method for deriving sharp lower bounds in non stationary bandits.

Conclusion: RED是一种快速计算、易于扩展的通用方法，能够有效提升各种方程发现系统的性能。

Abstract: Neural-guided equation discovery systems use a data set as prompt and predict an equation that describes the data set without extensive search. However, if the equation does not meet the user's expectations, there are few options for getting other equation suggestions without intensive work with the system. To fill this gap, we propose Residuals for Equation Discovery (RED), a post-processing method that improves a given equation in a targeted manner, based on its residuals. By parsing the initial equation to a syntax tree, we can use node-based calculation rules to compute the residual for each subequation of the initial equation. It is then possible to use this residual as new target variable in the original data set and generate a new prompt. If, with the new prompt, the equation discovery system suggests a subequation better than the old subequation on a validation set, we replace the latter by the former. RED is usable with any equation discovery system, is fast to calculate, and is easy to extend for new mathematical operations. In experiments on 53 equations from the Feynman benchmark, we show that it not only helps to improve all tested neural-guided systems, but also all tested classical genetic programming systems.

Conclusion: Blind-IGT框架成功解决了逆博弈理论中的参数识别问题，在马尔可夫博弈中表现出强大的经验性能。

Abstract: Inverse Game Theory (IGT) methods based on the entropy-regularized Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) offer a tractable approach for competitive settings, but critically assume the agents' rationality parameter (temperature $τ$) is known a priori. When $τ$ is unknown, a fundamental scale ambiguity emerges that couples $τ$ with the reward parameters ($θ$), making them statistically unidentifiable. We introduce Blind-IGT, the first statistical framework to jointly recover both $θ$ and $τ$ from observed behavior. We analyze this bilinear inverse problem and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for unique identification by introducing a normalization constraint that resolves the scale ambiguity. We propose an efficient Normalized Least Squares (NLS) estimator and prove it achieves the optimal $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ convergence rate for joint parameter recovery. When strong identifiability conditions fail, we provide partial identification guarantees through confidence set construction. We extend our framework to Markov games and demonstrate optimal convergence rates with strong empirical performance even when transition dynamics are unknown.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has become a trending paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Most existing RL systems for LLMs operate in a fully synchronous manner, where training must wait for the rollout of an entire batch to complete. This design leads to severe inefficiencies, as extremely long trajectories can stall the entire rollout process and leave many GPUs idle. To address this issue, we propose Concurrency- Controlled Partial Rollout with Importance Sampling (CoPRIS), which mitigates long-tail inefficiencies by maintaining a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, early-terminating once sufficient samples are collected, and reusing unfinished trajectories in subsequent rollouts. To mitigate the impact of off-policy trajectories, we introduce Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction, which concatenates buffered log probabilities from the previous policy with those recomputed under the current policy for importance sampling correction. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CoPRIS achieves up to 1.94x faster training while maintaining comparable or superior performance to synchronous RL systems. The code of CoPRIS is available at https://github.com/777pomingzi/CoPRIS.

*Valentin Noël*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种无需额外训练的诊断方法，通过分析注意力诱导的token图，在早期层计算高频能量比和谱熵两个谱统计量，用于在智能体执行过程中检测上下文不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能体语言模型的多步推理链可能因上下文不一致、检索错误或对抗性输入而损坏，事后评估为时已晚，因为错误在检测前已传播。

Method: 使用前向传播分析注意力诱导的token图，在早期层计算高频能量比和谱熵两个谱统计量，基于双机制混合假设和单调似然比性质，采用单一阈值进行贝叶斯最优检测。

Result: 高频能量比在多个模型族中展现出稳健的双峰性，检测开销低于1毫秒，能够集成到检索增强智能体管道中作为内联安全监控器。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在模型仍在处理文本时检测污染，在错误提交到推理链之前进行干预，实现实时上下文验证。

Abstract: Agentic language models compose multi step reasoning chains, yet intermediate steps can be corrupted by inconsistent context, retrieval errors, or adversarial inputs, which makes post hoc evaluation too late because errors propagate before detection. We introduce a diagnostic that requires no additional training and uses only the forward pass to emit a binary accept or reject signal during agent execution. The method analyzes token graphs induced by attention and computes two spectral statistics in early layers, namely the high frequency energy ratio and spectral entropy. We formalize these signals, establish invariances, and provide finite sample estimators with uncertainty quantification. Under a two regime mixture assumption with a monotone likelihood ratio property, we show that a single threshold on the high frequency energy ratio is optimal in the Bayes sense for detecting context inconsistency. Empirically, the high frequency energy ratio exhibits robust bimodality during context verification across multiple model families, which enables gating decisions with overhead below one millisecond on our hardware and configurations. We demonstrate integration into retrieval augmented agent pipelines and discuss deployment as an inline safety monitor. The approach detects contamination while the model is still processing the text, before errors commit to the reasoning chain.

Conclusion: FedSparQ为带宽受限的联邦学习部署提供了实用、易部署的解决方案，并为自适应精度和隐私保护协议的未来扩展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy by keeping raw data local. However, FL suffers from significant communication overhead due to the frequent exchange of high-dimensional model updates over constrained networks. In this paper, we present FedSparQ, a lightweight compression framework that dynamically sparsifies the gradient of each client through an adaptive threshold, applies half-precision quantization to retained entries and integrates residuals from error feedback to prevent loss of information. FedSparQ requires no manual tuning of sparsity rates or quantization schedules, adapts seamlessly to both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions, and is agnostic to model architecture. Through extensive empirical evaluation on vision benchmarks under independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data, we show that FedSparQ substantially reduces communication overhead (reducing by 90% of bytes sent compared to FedAvg) while preserving or improving model accuracy (improving by 6% compared to FedAvg non-compressed solution or to state-of-the-art compression models) and enhancing convergence robustness (by 50%, compared to the other baselines). Our approach provides a practical, easy-to-deploy solution for bandwidth-constrained federated deployments and lays the groundwork for future extensions in adaptive precision and privacy-preserving protocols.

Motivation: 分类数据聚类中合适的距离度量至关重要，但现有方法未考虑不同簇中属性值距离因分布不同而变化的特性，导致距离测量不合理。

Method: 提出簇定制化距离度量，基于每个簇中属性的不同分布来竞争性地更新距离，并将该方法扩展到包含数值和分类属性的混合数据。

Conclusion: 所提出的簇定制化距离度量方法在分类数据聚类中表现优异，能够有效处理不同簇中属性分布差异的问题。

Abstract: An appropriate distance metric is crucial for categorical data clustering, as the distance between categorical data cannot be directly calculated. However, the distances between attribute values usually vary in different clusters induced by their different distributions, which has not been taken into account, thus leading to unreasonable distance measurement. Therefore, we propose a cluster-customized distance metric for categorical data clustering, which can competitively update distances based on different distributions of attributes in each cluster. In addition, we extend the proposed distance metric to the mixed data that contains both numerical and categorical attributes. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, i.e., achieving an average ranking of around first in fourteen datasets.

Conclusion: GRAVER框架通过生成式图词汇实现了跨领域和任务的可靠知识迁移，解决了图基础模型微调中的不稳定性问题

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of foundation models in language and vision, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) hold significant promise for broad applicability across diverse graph tasks and domains. However, existing GFMs struggle with unstable few-shot fine-tuning, where both performance and adaptation efficiency exhibit significant fluctuations caused by the randomness in the support sample selection and structural discrepancies between the pre-trained and target graphs. How to fine-tune GFMs robustly and efficiently to enable trustworthy knowledge transfer across domains and tasks is the major challenge. In this paper, we propose GRAVER, a novel Generative gRAph VocabulariEs for Robust GFM fine-tuning framework that tackles the aforementioned instability via generative augmentations. Specifically, to identify transferable units, we analyze and extract key class-specific subgraph patterns by ego-graph disentanglement and validate their transferability both theoretically and empirically. To enable effective pre-training across diverse domains, we leverage a universal task template based on ego-graph similarity and construct graph vocabularies via graphon-based generative experts. To facilitate robust and efficient prompt fine-tuning, we grave the support samples with in-context vocabularies, where the lightweight MoE-CoE network attentively routes knowledge from source domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GRAVER over effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency on downstream few-shot node and graph classification tasks compared with 15 state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple clients while optionally preserving data privacy. However, communication efficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for large-scale models. In this work, we introduce two complementary algorithms: ProjFL, designed for unbiased compressors, and ProjFL+EF, tailored for biased compressors through an Error Feedback mechanism. Both methods rely on projecting local gradients onto a shared client-server subspace spanned by historical descent directions, enabling efficient information exchange with minimal communication overhead. We establish convergence guarantees for both algorithms under strongly convex, convex, and non-convex settings. Empirical evaluations on standard FL classification benchmarks with deep neural networks show that ProjFL and ProjFL+EF achieve accuracy comparable to existing baselines while substantially reducing communication costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个针对稀疏线性回归问题的通用正结果，能够在任意设计矩阵下，通过多项式时间和样本复杂度实现稀疏信号恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏线性回归在信息理论上只需要O(k log d/ε)个样本，但计算上需要d^Ω(k)的运行时间，存在指数级差距。现有方法要么需要随机设计矩阵，要么需要低条件数矩阵，无法处理任意设计矩阵。

Method: 提出一种新算法，当稀疏信号的支撑集是随机选择时，能够在任意设计矩阵（条件数最多为2^poly(d)）下，使用poly(k, log d, 1/ε)个样本和poly(d,N)的运行时间实现预测误差ε。

Result: 首次证明了对于任意设计矩阵，只要稀疏信号的支撑集是随机选择的，就能在多项式时间和样本复杂度下实现稀疏线性回归。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了稀疏线性回归在计算复杂度和样本复杂度之间的理论空白，为处理任意设计矩阵的稀疏回归问题提供了首个通用正结果。

Abstract: Sparse linear regression is one of the most basic questions in machine learning and statistics. Here, we are given as input a design matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$ and measurements or labels ${y} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ where ${y} = {X} {w}^* + ξ$, and $ξ$ is the noise in the measurements. Importantly, we have the additional constraint that the unknown signal vector ${w}^*$ is sparse: it has $k$ non-zero entries where $k$ is much smaller than the ambient dimension. Our goal is to output a prediction vector $\widehat{w}$ that has small prediction error: $\frac{1}{N}\cdot \|{X} {w}^* - {X} \widehat{w}\|^2_2$.
  Information-theoretically, we know what is best possible in terms of measurements: under most natural noise distributions, we can get prediction error at most $ε$ with roughly $N = O(k \log d/ε)$ samples. Computationally, this currently needs $d^{Ω(k)}$ run-time. Alternately, with $N = O(d)$, we can get polynomial-time. Thus, there is an exponential gap (in the dependence on $d$) between the two and we do not know if it is possible to get $d^{o(k)}$ run-time and $o(d)$ samples.
  We give the first generic positive result for worst-case design matrices ${X}$: For any ${X}$, we show that if the support of ${w}^*$ is chosen at random, we can get prediction error $ε$ with $N = \text{poly}(k, \log d, 1/ε)$ samples and run-time $\text{poly}(d,N)$. This run-time holds for any design matrix ${X}$ with condition number up to $2^{\text{poly}(d)}$.
  Previously, such results were known for worst-case ${w}^*$, but only for random design matrices from well-behaved families, matrices that have a very low condition number ($\text{poly}(\log d)$; e.g., as studied in compressed sensing), or those with special structural properties.

Abstract: In the era of smart manufacturing, predictive maintenance (PdM) plays a pivotal role in improving equipment reliability and reducing operating costs. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework that integrates advanced soft computing techniques - Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), Denoising Autoencoder (DAE), Graph Neural Network (GNN), and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) - to address the multidimensional challenges of predictive maintenance in complex manufacturing systems. Specifically, the proposed framework innovatively combines the powerful frequency-domain representation capability of FNOs to capture high-dimensional temporal patterns; DAEs to achieve robust, noise-resistant latent state embedding from complex non-Gaussian sensor data; and GNNs to accurately represent inter-device dependencies for coordinated system-wide maintenance decisions. Furthermore, by exploiting PPO, the framework ensures stable and efficient optimisation of long-term maintenance strategies to effectively handle uncertainty and non-stationary dynamics. Experimental validation demonstrates that the approach significantly outperforms multiple deep learning baseline models with up to 13% cost reduction, as well as strong convergence and inter-module synergy. The framework has considerable industrial potential to effectively reduce downtime and operating expenses through data-driven strategies.

Abstract: Since 2010, Kaggle has been a platform where data scientists from around the world come together to compete, collaborate, and push the boundaries of Data Science. Over these 15 years, it has grown from a purely competition-focused site into a broader ecosystem with forums, notebooks, models, datasets, and more. With the release of the Kaggle Meta Code and Kaggle Meta Datasets, we now have a unique opportunity to explore these competitions, technologies, and real-world applications of Machine Learning and AI. And so in this study, we take a closer look at 15 years of data science on Kaggle - through metadata, shared code, community discussions, and the competitions themselves. We explore Kaggle's growth, its impact on the data science community, uncover hidden technological trends, analyze competition winners, how Kagglers approach problems in general, and more. We do this by analyzing millions of kernels and discussion threads to perform both longitudinal trend analysis and standard exploratory data analysis. Our findings show that Kaggle is a steadily growing platform with increasingly diverse use cases, and that Kagglers are quick to adapt to new trends and apply them to real-world challenges, while producing - on average - models with solid generalization capabilities. We also offer a snapshot of the platform as a whole, highlighting its history and technological evolution.

Conclusion: 建立了一个通过时空流交互建模复杂系统的原则性方法，FlowNet在性能和物理可解释性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Accurately modeling complex dynamic spatio-temporal systems requires capturing flow-mediated interdependencies and context-sensitive interaction dynamics. Existing methods, predominantly graph-based or attention-driven, rely on similarity-driven connectivity assumptions, neglecting asymmetric flow exchanges that govern system evolution. We propose Spatio-Temporal Flow, a physics-inspired paradigm that explicitly models dynamic node couplings through quantifiable flow transfers governed by conservation principles. Building on this, we design FlowNet, a novel architecture leveraging flow tokens as information carriers to simulate source-to-destination transfers via Flow Allocation Modules, ensuring state redistribution aligns with conservation laws. FlowNet dynamically adjusts the interaction radius through an Adaptive Spatial Masking module, suppressing irrelevant noise while enabling context-aware propagation. A cascaded architecture enhances scalability and nonlinear representation capacity. Experiments demonstrate that FlowNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on seven metrics in the modeling of three real-world systems, validating its efficiency and physical interpretability. We establish a principled methodology for modeling complex systems through spatio-temporal flow interactions.

Conclusion: 通过理论分析揭示了大规模稀疏类别特征导致过拟合的根本原因，并提出有效的自适应正则化解决方案，成功解决了多epoch训练的性能退化问题。

Abstract: The one-epoch overfitting problem has drawn widespread attention, especially in CTR and CVR estimation models in search, advertising, and recommendation domains. These models which rely heavily on large-scale sparse categorical features, often suffer a significant decline in performance when trained for multiple epochs. Although recent studies have proposed heuristic solutions, they have not clearly identified the fundamental cause of this phenomenon. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis that explains why overfitting occurs in models that use large-scale sparse categorical features. Based on this analysis, we propose an adaptive regularization method to address it. Our approach not only prevents the severe performance degradation observed during multi-epoch training, but also improves model performance within a single epoch. This method has already been deployed in online production systems.

Abstract: This study presents a new high-fidelity multi-modal dataset containing 16000+ geometric variants of automotive hoods useful for machine learning (ML) applications such as engineering component design and process optimization, and multiphysics system surrogates. The dataset is centered on a practical multiphysics problem-hood deformation from fluid entrapment and inertial loading during rotary-dip painting. Each hood is numerically modeled with a coupled Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)-Finite Element Analysis (FEA), using 1.2M cells in total to ensure spatial and temporal accuracy. The dataset provides time-resolved physical fields, along with STL meshes and structured natural language prompts for text-to-geometry synthesis. Existing datasets are either confined to 2D cases, exhibit limited geometric variations, or lack the multi-modal annotations and data structures - shortcomings we address with AutoHood3D. We validate our numerical methodology, establish quantitative baselines across five neural architectures, and demonstrate systematic surrogate errors in displacement and force predictions. These findings motivate the design of novel approaches and multiphysics loss functions that enforce fluid-solid coupling during model training. By providing fully reproducible workflows, AutoHood3D enables physics-aware ML development, accelerates generative-design iteration, and facilitates the creation of new FSI benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明该方法比现有采样方法更好地刻画鲁棒性，比形式化方法具有更好的可扩展性，适用于大规模神经网络

Conclusion: 该方法为对抗鲁棒性验证提供了有效的概率性保证框架，突破了传统方法的可扩展性限制

Abstract: We propose and investigate probabilistic guarantees for the adversarial robustness of classification algorithms. While traditional formal verification approaches for robustness are intractable and sampling-based approaches do not provide formal guarantees, our approach is able to efficiently certify a probabilistic relaxation of robustness. The key idea is to sample an $ε$-net and invoke a local robustness oracle on the sample. Remarkably, the size of the sample needed to achieve probably approximately global robustness guarantees is independent of the input dimensionality, the number of classes, and the learning algorithm itself. Our approach can, therefore, be applied even to large neural networks that are beyond the scope of traditional formal verification. Experiments empirically confirm that it characterizes robustness better than state-of-the-art sampling-based approaches and scales better than formal methods.

Motivation: 受隐私法规和"被遗忘权"驱动，需要在边缘设备上实现机器遗忘，但传统的服务器中心化或重训练方法在计算和能耗受限的边缘环境中不实用。

Method: 结合上下文自适应遗忘（从后端层开始编辑，达到目标遗忘后停止）和平衡阻尼（按深度缩放阻尼强度以保持保留准确率），并在RISC-V边缘AI处理器中实现轻量级IP用于Fisher估计和阻尼。

Conclusion: FiCABU证明了后端优先、深度感知的遗忘学习可以在资源受限的边缘AI设备上实现实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning, driven by privacy regulations and the "right to be forgotten", is increasingly needed at the edge, yet server-centric or retraining-heavy methods are impractical under tight computation and energy budgets. We present FiCABU (Fisher-based Context-Adaptive Balanced Unlearning), a software-hardware co-design that brings unlearning to edge AI processors. FiCABU combines (i) Context-Adaptive Unlearning, which begins edits from back-end layers and halts once the target forgetting is reached, with (ii) Balanced Dampening, which scales dampening strength by depth to preserve retain accuracy. These methods are realized in a full RTL design of a RISC-V edge AI processor that integrates two lightweight IPs for Fisher estimation and dampening into a GEMM-centric streaming pipeline, validated on an FPGA prototype and synthesized in 45 nm for power analysis. Across CIFAR-20 and PinsFaceRecognition with ResNet-18 and ViT, FiCABU achieves random-guess forget accuracy while matching the retraining-free Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD) baseline on retain accuracy, reducing computation by up to 87.52 percent (ResNet-18) and 71.03 percent (ViT). On the INT8 hardware prototype, FiCABU further improves retain preservation and reduces energy to 6.48 percent (CIFAR-20) and 0.13 percent (PinsFaceRecognition) of the SSD baseline. In sum, FiCABU demonstrates that back-end-first, depth-aware unlearning can be made both practical and efficient for resource-constrained edge AI devices.

*João Mattos,Debolina Halder Lina,Arlei Silva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了图机器学习中链接预测任务的公平性问题，指出现有基于二元公平性定义的方法存在缺陷，提出了新的评估框架和轻量级后处理方法来解决偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 链接预测中的公平性至关重要，因为偏见预测会加剧社会不平等。现有工作采用二元公平性定义，但这种框架可能掩盖子群体间的潜在差异，且人口均等性不适用于基于排名的链接预测任务。

Method: 首先形式化现有公平性评估的局限性，提出一个更具表达力的评估框架。然后提出结合解耦链接预测器的轻量级后处理方法，有效减轻偏见。

Result: 该方法在公平性与效用之间达到了最先进的权衡效果。

Conclusion: 现有二元公平性框架存在局限性，需要更细粒度的评估方法。提出的后处理方法能有效缓解偏见，同时保持良好的预测性能。

Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental task in graph machine learning with applications, ranging from social recommendation to knowledge graph completion. Fairness in this setting is critical, as biased predictions can exacerbate societal inequalities. Prior work adopts a dyadic definition of fairness, enforcing fairness through demographic parity between intra-group and inter-group link predictions. However, we show that this dyadic framing can obscure underlying disparities across subgroups, allowing systemic biases to go undetected. Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction. We formalize the limitations of existing fairness evaluations and propose a framework that enables a more expressive assessment. Additionally, we propose a lightweight post-processing method combined with decoupled link predictors that effectively mitigates bias and achieves state-of-the-art fairness-utility trade-offs.

TL;DR: 提出结合LSTM预测和保形预测的自适应框架，用于水分配网络数字孪生中的状态估计，通过节点级不确定性分析优化传感器部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水分配网络数字孪生需要有限传感器下的准确状态估计，均匀采样在不同不确定性节点间浪费资源。

Method: 使用LSTM进行预测，结合边际保形预测估计节点级不确定性，将感知资源集中在最不确定的节点上。

Result: 在Hanoi、Net3和CTOWN数据集上，40%覆盖率时需求误差比均匀采样降低33-34%，仅增加5-10%计算量即可保持89.4-90.2%的经验覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该自适应框架能有效优化水分配网络数字孪生的传感器部署，在降低误差的同时保持高覆盖率和低计算成本。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) for Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) require accurate state estimation with limited sensors. Uniform sampling often wastes resources across nodes with different uncertainty. We propose an adaptive framework combining LSTM forecasting and Conformal Prediction (CP) to estimate node-wise uncertainty and focus sensing on the most uncertain points. Marginal CP is used for its low computational cost, suitable for real-time DTs. Experiments on Hanoi, Net3, and CTOWN show 33-34% lower demand error than uniform sampling at 40% coverage and maintain 89.4-90.2% empirical coverage with only 5-10% extra computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Neyman-Pearson分类中的迁移学习问题，提出了一种自适应方法，能够在源数据信息丰富时改善Type-I和Type-II错误，在源数据无信息时避免负迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类中的迁移学习已被广泛研究，但在不平衡分类（如Neyman-Pearson分类）中的迁移学习关注较少。现有工作只处理μ₁分布的偏移，而实际场景中μ₀和μ₁都可能发生偏移，这给同时控制两类错误带来了独特挑战。

Method: 开发了一种自适应程序，能够保证在源数据信息丰富时改善Type-I和Type-II错误，并在源数据无信息时自动适应以避免负迁移。该方法具有统计保证和计算效率保证。

Result: 提出的自适应程序在源数据信息丰富时能够改善两类错误性能，在源数据无信息时能够避免负迁移，同时具有计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为Neyman-Pearson分类中的迁移学习提供了一种有效的自适应方法，能够处理μ₀和μ₁同时发生分布偏移的实际情况，并保证统计性能和计算效率。

Abstract: We consider the problem of transfer learning in Neyman-Pearson classification, where the objective is to minimize the error w.r.t. a distribution $μ_1$, subject to the constraint that the error w.r.t. a distribution $μ_0$ remains below a prescribed threshold. While transfer learning has been extensively studied in traditional classification, transfer learning in imbalanced classification such as Neyman-Pearson classification has received much less attention. This setting poses unique challenges, as both types of errors must be simultaneously controlled. Existing works address only the case of distribution shift in $μ_1$, whereas in many practical scenarios shifts may occur in both $μ_0$ and $μ_1$. We derive an adaptive procedure that not only guarantees improved Type-I and Type-II errors when the source is informative, but also automatically adapt to situations where the source is uninformative, thereby avoiding negative transfer. In addition to such statistical guarantees, the procedures is efficient, as shown via complementary computational guarantees.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning research spans diverse domains and data modalities, yet existing benchmark efforts remain siloed and lack standardization. This makes novel and transformative applications of machine learning to critical scientific use-cases more fragmented and less clear in pathways to impact. This paper introduces an ontology for scientific benchmarking developed through a unified, community-driven effort that extends the MLCommons ecosystem to cover physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, climate science, and more. Building on prior initiatives such as XAI-BENCH, FastML Science Benchmarks, PDEBench, and the SciMLBench framework, our effort consolidates a large set of disparate benchmarks and frameworks into a single taxonomy of scientific, application, and system-level benchmarks. New benchmarks can be added through an open submission workflow coordinated by the MLCommons Science Working Group and evaluated against a six-category rating rubric that promotes and identifies high-quality benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to select benchmarks that meet their specific needs. The architecture is extensible, supporting future scientific and AI/ML motifs, and we discuss methods for identifying emerging computing patterns for unique scientific workloads. The MLCommons Science Benchmarks Ontology provides a standardized, scalable foundation for reproducible, cross-domain benchmarking in scientific machine learning. A companion webpage for this work has also been developed as the effort evolves: https://mlcommons-science.github.io/benchmark/

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理不完美的先验知识，通过协调知识和数据实现鲁棒的因果发现。

Abstract: Robust causal discovery from observational data under imperfect prior knowledge remains a significant and largely unresolved challenge. Existing methods typically presuppose perfect priors or can only handle specific, pre-identified error types. And their performance degrades substantially when confronted with flawed constraints of unknown location and type. This decline arises because most of them rely on inflexible and biased thresholding strategies that may conflict with the data distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose to harmonizes knowledge and data through prior alignment and conflict resolution. First, we assess the credibility of imperfect structural constraints through a surrogate model, which then guides a sparse penalization term measuring the loss between the learned and constrained adjacency matrices. We theoretically prove that, under ideal assumption, the knowledge-driven objective aligns with the data-driven objective. Furthermore, to resolve conflicts when this assumption is violated, we introduce a multi-task learning framework optimized via multi-gradient descent, jointly minimizing both objectives. Our proposed method is robust to both linear and nonlinear settings. Extensive experiments, conducted under diverse noise conditions and structural equation model types, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method under imperfect structural constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在硬件中的实现，硬件综合过程成为设计快速迭代的限制因素，需要开发基于ML的替代模型来估计ML加速器架构的资源使用。

Method: 创建了包含68万多个全连接和卷积神经网络的基准数据集，使用hls4ml工具针对Xilinx FPGA进行综合，并开发了基于GNN和transformer的替代模型来预测延迟和资源使用。

Conclusion: wa-hls4ml基准测试和相应的替代模型为解决ML加速器设计中的硬件综合瓶颈提供了有效工具，能够准确预测资源使用和延迟。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) is increasingly implemented in hardware to address real-time challenges in scientific applications, the development of advanced toolchains has significantly reduced the time required to iterate on various designs. These advancements have solved major obstacles, but also exposed new challenges. For example, processes that were not previously considered bottlenecks, such as hardware synthesis, are becoming limiting factors in the rapid iteration of designs. To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators. We present the architecture and performance of the models and find that the models generally predict latency and resources for the 75% percentile within several percent of the synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.

TL;DR: 提出Data Value-Weighted Unlearning (DVWU)框架，通过考虑数据价值异质性来改进机器遗忘算法，提升更新模型的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘算法忽视了不同数据点对模型性能的贡献差异（数据价值异质性），平等处理所有数据点会导致更新模型性能下降。

Method: 设计了基于数据价值的加权策略，并将其整合到遗忘过程中，实现不同效用数据点的差异化遗忘。以一步牛顿更新为例，开发了输出扰动和目标扰动算法实现认证遗忘。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，相比传统遗忘方法，DVWU方法获得了更优的预测性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DVWU框架能够广泛适应现有机器遗忘方法，并展示了在梯度上升方法中的可扩展性，为基于梯度的深度遗忘方法提供了适应性。

Abstract: As the right to be forgotten becomes legislated worldwide, machine unlearning mechanisms have emerged to efficiently update models for data deletion and enhance user privacy protection. However, existing machine unlearning algorithms frequently neglect the fact that different data points may contribute unequally to model performance (i.e., heterogeneous data values). Treat them equally in machine unlearning procedure can potentially degrading the performance of updated models. To address this limitation, we propose Data Value-Weighted Unlearning (DVWU), a general unlearning framework that accounts for data value heterogeneity into the unlearning process. Specifically, we design a weighting strategy based on data values, which are then integrated into the unlearning procedure to enable differentiated unlearning for data points with varying utility to the model. The DVWU framework can be broadly adapted to various existing machine unlearning methods. We use the one-step Newton update as an example for implementation, developing both output and objective perturbation algorithms to achieve certified unlearning. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods achieve superior predictive performance and robustness compared to conventional unlearning approaches. We further show the extensibility of our framework on gradient ascent method by incorporating the proposed weighting strategy into the gradient terms, highlighting the adaptability of DVWU for broader gradient-based deep unlearning methods.

Method: 通过工业规模移动游戏玩家参与度预测任务进行实证分析，并设计受控合成实验对比已见和未见频率带的信号。

Result: 在工业任务中，时间序列基础模型表现不如领域自适应基线；合成实验显示频谱不匹配会导致系统性能下降。

Conclusion: 频率感知对于稳健的时间序列基础模型部署至关重要，需要开发考虑频谱多样性的新预训练和评估协议。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong results on public benchmarks, prompting comparisons to a "BERT moment" for time series. Their effectiveness in industrial settings, however, remains uncertain. We examine why TSFMs often struggle to generalize and highlight spectral shift (a mismatch between the dominant frequency components in downstream tasks and those represented during pretraining) as a key factor. We present evidence from an industrial-scale player engagement prediction task in mobile gaming, where TSFMs underperform domain-adapted baselines. To isolate the mechanism, we design controlled synthetic experiments contrasting signals with seen versus unseen frequency bands, observing systematic degradation under spectral mismatch. These findings position frequency awareness as critical for robust TSFM deployment and motivate new pretraining and evaluation protocols that explicitly account for spectral diversity.

Result: 在分类、插值和预测任务上的大量实验表明，iTimER在不规则采样时间序列设置下始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: iTimER通过利用重建误差作为学习信号，有效提升了不规则采样时间序列的表示学习性能。

Abstract: Irregularly sampled time series (ISTS), characterized by non-uniform time intervals with natural missingness, are prevalent in real-world applications. Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last available observations. This transforms unobserved timestamps into noise-aware training targets, enabling meaningful reconstruction signals. A Wasserstein metric aligns reconstruction error distributions between observed and pseudo-observed regions, while a contrastive learning objective enhances the discriminability of learned representations. Extensive experiments on classification, interpolation, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that iTimER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the ISTS setting.

Method: 使用Actor-Critic框架，通过改变模型容量进行系统研究，并采用信息论指标策略熵来测量训练过程中的策略不确定性。

Result: 初步结果显示存在明显的逐epoch双下降曲线，策略进入第二下降区域与策略熵的持续显著减少相关。

Conclusion: 过参数化作为隐式正则化器，引导策略走向损失景观中更稳健、更平坦的最小值，为设计更通用、可迁移和鲁棒的智能体提供了信息基础机制。

Abstract: The double descent (DD) paradox, where over-parameterized models see generalization improve past the interpolation point, remains largely unexplored in the non-stationary domain of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We present preliminary evidence that DD exists in model-free DRL, investigating it systematically across varying model capacity using the Actor-Critic framework. We rely on an information-theoretic metric, Policy Entropy, to measure policy uncertainty throughout training. Preliminary results show a clear epoch-wise DD curve; the policy's entrance into the second descent region correlates with a sustained, significant reduction in Policy Entropy. This entropic decay suggests that over-parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, guiding the policy towards robust, flatter minima in the loss landscape. These findings establish DD as a factor in DRL and provide an information-based mechanism for designing agents that are more general, transferable, and robust.

Conclusion: 通过跟踪样本有效权重的轨迹，为解释类特定决策边界的形成和网络中语义表示的出现提供了新的视角

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly those employing Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), are often perceived as complex, high-dimensional, non-linear systems. This complexity poses a significant challenge to understanding their internal learning mechanisms. In this work, we propose a novel analytical framework that recasts a multi-layer ReLU network into an equivalent single-layer linear model with input-dependent "effective weights". For any given input sample, the activation pattern of ReLU units creates a unique computational path, effectively zeroing out a subset of weights in the network. By composing the active weights across all layers, we can derive an effective weight matrix, $W_{\text{eff}}(x)$, that maps the input directly to the output for that specific sample. We posit that the evolution of these effective weights reveals fundamental principles of representation learning. Our work demonstrates that as training progresses, the effective weights corresponding to samples from the same class converge, while those from different classes diverge. By tracking the trajectories of these sample-wise effective weights, we provide a new lens through which to interpret the formation of class-specific decision boundaries and the emergence of semantic representations within the network.

Abstract: Fairness concerns are increasingly critical as machine learning models are deployed in high-stakes applications. While existing fairness-aware methods typically intervene at the model level, they often suffer from high computational costs, limited scalability, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian data selection framework that ensures fairness by aligning group-specific posterior distributions of model parameters and sample weights with a shared central distribution. Our framework supports flexible alignment via various distributional discrepancy measures, including Wasserstein distance, maximum mean discrepancy, and $f$-divergence, allowing geometry-aware control without imposing explicit fairness constraints. This data-centric approach mitigates group-specific biases in training data and improves fairness in downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms existing data selection and model-based fairness methods in both fairness and accuracy.

Abstract: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is crucial for understanding upper-ocean thermal dynamics and ocean-atmosphere interactions, which have profound economic and social impacts. While data-driven models show promise in SST prediction, their black-box nature often limits interpretability and overlooks key physical processes. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been gaining momentum but struggle with complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics due to 1) inadequate characterization of seawater movement (e.g., coastal upwelling) and 2) insufficient integration of external SST drivers (e.g., turbulent heat fluxes). To address these challenges, we propose SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) framework for SST prediction. First, we derive ODEs from fluid transport principles, incorporating both advection and diffusion to model ocean spatiotemporal dynamics. Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performances in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, SSTODE visually reveals the impact of advection dynamics, thermal diffusion patterns, and diurnal heating-cooling cycles on SST evolution. These findings demonstrate the model's interpretability and physical consistency.

Conclusion: 揭示了深度ReLU网络的极限核行为特性，并描述了将结果推广到其他核的基本性质

Abstract: Overparameterized fully-connected neural networks have been shown to behave like kernel models when trained with gradient descent, under mild conditions on the width, the learning rate, and the parameter initialization. In the limit of infinitely large widths and small learning rate, the kernel that is obtained allows to represent the output of the learned model with a closed-form solution. This closed-form solution hinges on the invertibility of the limiting kernel, a property that often holds on real-world datasets. In this work, we analyze the sensitivity of large ReLU networks to increasing depths by characterizing the corresponding limiting kernel. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the normalized limiting kernel approaches the matrix of ones. In contrast, they show the corresponding closed-form solution approaches a fixed limit on the sphere. We empirically evaluate the order of magnitude in network depth required to observe this convergent behavior, and we describe the essential properties that enable the generalization of our results to other kernels.

Conclusion: 结合机器学习的混合方法能够有效改进湍流模型不确定性量化，在保持物理合理性的同时提供更准确的不确定性边界。

Abstract: Predicting the evolution of turbulent flows is central across science and engineering. Most studies rely on simulations with turbulence models, whose empirical simplifications introduce epistemic uncertainty. The Eigenspace Perturbation Method (EPM) is a widely used physics-based approach to quantify model-form uncertainty, but being purely physics-based it can overpredict uncertainty bounds. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based modulation of EPM perturbation magnitudes to improve calibration while preserving physical consistency. Across canonical cases, the hybrid ML-EPM framework yields substantially tighter, better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than baseline EPM alone.

Motivation: 线性回归广泛应用于各领域，但涉及敏感数据时需要保护隐私。现有差分私有方法通常估计带噪声的参数向量，作者希望开发能直接发布私有草图的方法。

Method: 开发差分私有草图方法，为最小二乘回归和最小绝对偏差回归问题创建私有数据集摘要，使常用求解器能在不泄露隐私的情况下应用。

Result: 成功设计了两种回归问题的私有草图方法，提供了隐私保护的替代方案。

Conclusion: 私有草图方法为线性回归提供了新的隐私保护途径，便于使用现有求解器而不损害数据隐私。

Abstract: Linear regression is frequently applied in a variety of domains. In order to improve the efficiency of these methods, various methods have been developed that compute summaries or \emph{sketches} of the datasets. Certain domains, however, contain sensitive data which necessitates that the application of these statistical methods does not reveal private information. Differentially private (DP) linear regression methods have been developed for mitigating this problem. These techniques typically involve estimating a noisy version of the parameter vector. Instead, we propose releasing private sketches of the datasets. We present differentially private sketches for the problems of least squares regression, as well as least absolute deviations regression. The availability of these private sketches facilitates the application of commonly available solvers for regression, without the risk of privacy leakage.

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验验证都表明，transformer通过注意力集中机制能够实现长度泛化，递归自训练可以逐步扩展可解决问题的长度范围。

Abstract: The ability to reason lies at the core of artificial intelligence (AI), and challenging problems usually call for deeper and longer reasoning to tackle. A crucial question about AI reasoning is whether models can extrapolate learned reasoning patterns to solve harder tasks with longer chain-of-thought (CoT). In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of transformers learning on synthetic state-tracking tasks with gradient descent. We mathematically prove how the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs the degree of extrapolation of the learned CoT. Specifically, our theory characterizes the length generalization of transformers through the mechanism of attention concentration, linking the retrieval robustness of the attention layer to the state-tracking task structure of long-context reasoning. Moreover, for transformers with limited reasoning length, we prove that a recursive self-training scheme can progressively extend the range of solvable problem lengths. To our knowledge, we provide the first optimization guarantee that constant-depth transformers provably learn $\mathsf{NC}^1$-complete problems with CoT, significantly going beyond prior art confined in $\mathsf{TC}^0$, unless the widely held conjecture $\mathsf{TC}^0 \neq \mathsf{NC}^1$ fails. Finally, we present a broad set of experiments supporting our theoretical results, confirming the length generalization behaviors and the mechanism of attention concentration.

Conclusion: QiVC框架展示了在真实世界生物医学信号分析中推进不确定性感知建模的潜力，其实现已在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: This work introduces the quantum-inspired variational convolution (QiVC) framework, a novel learning paradigm that integrates principles of probabilistic inference, variational optimization, and quantum-inspired transformations within convolutional architectures. The central innovation of QiVC lies in its quantum-inspired rotated ensemble (QiRE) mechanism. QiRE performs differentiable low-dimensional subspace rotations of convolutional weights, analogously to quantum state evolution. This approach enables structured uncertainty modeling while preserving the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space, resulting in more expressive, stable, and uncertainty-aware representations. To demonstrate its practical potential, the concept is instantiated in a QiVC-based convolutional network (QiVC-Net) and evaluated in the context of biosignal classification, focusing on phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings, a challenging domain characterized by high noise, inter-subject variability, and often imbalanced data. The proposed QiVC-Net integrates an architecture in which the QiVC layer does not introduce additional parameters, instead performing an ensemble rotation of the convolutional weights through a structured mechanism ensuring robustness without added highly computational burden. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, PhysioNet CinC 2016 and PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope 2022, show that QiVC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching accuracies of 97.84% and 97.89%, respectively. These findings highlight the versatility of the QiVC framework and its promise for advancing uncertainty-aware modeling in real-world biomedical signal analysis. The implementation of the QiVConv layer is openly available in GitHub.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have demonstrated competitive results on various tasks including language generation. However, due to its iterative refinement process, the inference is often bottlenecked by slow and static sampling speed. To overcome this problem, we introduce `KL-Adaptive Stability Sampling' (KLASS), a fast yet effective sampling method that exploits token-level KL divergence to identify stable, high-confidence predictions. By unmasking multiple tokens in each iteration without any additional model training, our approach speeds up generation significantly while maintaining sample quality. On reasoning benchmarks, KLASS achieves up to $2.78\times$ wall-clock speedups while improving performance over standard greedy decoding, attaining state-of-the-art results among diffusion-based samplers. We further validate KLASS across diverse domains, including text, image, and molecular generation, showing its effectiveness as a broadly applicable sampler across different models.

TL;DR: 提出了DR-SPCRL方法，将鲁棒性预算ε作为连续课程进行自适应调度，解决了传统DRRL中固定ε导致的性能与鲁棒性权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习策略在受控环境中训练后，在真实世界部署时经常因分布偏移而失效。传统DRRL方法固定鲁棒性预算ε会导致性能与鲁棒性的权衡问题：小ε值性能高但鲁棒性弱，大ε值则不稳定且策略过于保守。

Conclusion: 自适应调度鲁棒性预算的方法能够有效解决DRRL中的性能-鲁棒性权衡问题，实现更稳定和高效的训练。

Abstract: A central challenge in reinforcement learning is that policies trained in controlled environments often fail under distribution shifts at deployment into real-world environments. Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning (DRRL) addresses this by optimizing for worst-case performance within an uncertainty set defined by a robustness budget $ε$. However, fixing $ε$ results in a tradeoff between performance and robustness: small values yield high nominal performance but weak robustness, while large values can result in instability and overly conservative policies. We propose Distributionally Robust Self-Paced Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (DR-SPCRL), a method that overcomes this limitation by treating $ε$ as a continuous curriculum. DR-SPCRL adaptively schedules the robustness budget according to the agent's progress, enabling a balance between nominal and robust performance. Empirical results across multiple environments demonstrate that DR-SPCRL not only stabilizes training but also achieves a superior robustness-performance trade-off, yielding an average 11.8\% increase in episodic return under varying perturbations compared to fixed or heuristic scheduling strategies, and achieving approximately 1.9$\times$ the performance of the corresponding nominal RL algorithms.

Conclusion: 基于KAE的框架为处理时变图数据提供了一种有效方法，能够学习图结构演化的潜在动力学，支持预测和重建应用。

Abstract: A wide variety of real-world data, such as sea measurements, e.g., temperatures collected by distributed sensors and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) trajectories, can be naturally represented as graphs, often exhibiting non-Euclidean structures. These graph representations may evolve over time, forming time-varying graphs. Effectively modeling and analyzing such dynamic graph data is critical for tasks like predicting graph evolution and reconstructing missing graph data. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the Koopman autoencoder (KAE) to handle time-varying graph data. Specifically, we assume the existence of a hidden non-linear dynamical system, where the state vector corresponds to the graph embedding of the time-varying graph signals. To capture the evolving graph structures, the graph data is first converted into a vector time series through graph embedding, representing the structural information in a finite-dimensional latent space. In this latent space, the KAE is applied to learn the underlying non-linear dynamics governing the temporal evolution of graph features, enabling both prediction and reconstruction tasks.

Method: 提出TabDistill框架，将预训练Transformer模型的知识蒸馏到更简单的神经网络中。

Result: 蒸馏后的神经网络在相同训练数据下超越了传统基线方法（神经网络、XGBoost、逻辑回归），有时甚至超过了原始Transformer模型。

Conclusion: TabDistill框架实现了参数效率和少样本性能的最佳平衡，为表格数据分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown promising performance on tabular data compared to their classical counterparts such as neural networks and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) in scenarios with limited training data. They utilize their pre-trained knowledge to adapt to new domains, achieving commendable performance with only a few training examples, also called the few-shot regime. However, the performance gain in the few-shot regime comes at the expense of significantly increased complexity and number of parameters. To circumvent this trade-off, we introduce TabDistill, a new strategy to distill the pre-trained knowledge in complex transformer-based models into simpler neural networks for effectively classifying tabular data. Our framework yields the best of both worlds: being parameter-efficient while performing well with limited training data. The distilled neural networks surpass classical baselines such as regular neural networks, XGBoost and logistic regression under equal training data, and in some cases, even the original transformer-based models that they were distilled from.

Abstract: We consider the problem of distributionally robust multimodal machine learning. Existing approaches often rely on merging modalities on the feature level (early fusion) or heuristic uncertainty modeling, which downplays modality-aware effects and provide limited insights. We propose a novel distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework that aims to study both the theoretical and practical insights of multimodal machine learning. We first justify this setup and show the significance of this problem through complexity analysis. We then establish both generalization upper bounds and minimax lower bounds which provide performance guarantees. These results are further extended in settings where we consider encoder-specific error propogations. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach improves robustness in both simulation settings and real-world datasets. Together, these findings provide a principled foundation for employing multimodal machine learning models in high-stakes applications where uncertainty is unavoidable.

Motivation: 传统计算模型仅依赖结构信息，无法捕捉影响疾病机制和治疗反应的遗传决定因素，因此需要开发能够整合结构和遗传特征的新方法。

Method: 使用图同构网络(GIN)建模蛋白质-配体复合物的分子图表示，通过预训练Transformer(ProtBERT/ESM)将基因序列编码为生物学有意义的嵌入，并通过多层感知机融合这两种互补模态以实现跨模态交互学习。

Conclusion: 同时整合结构和遗传特征能够更准确地预测结合亲和力，为加速胃肠道疾病靶向治疗和疫苗设计提供了可靠的计算工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity plays a pivotal role in accelerating the discovery of novel drugs and vaccines, particularly for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases such as gastric ulcers, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Traditional computational models often rely on structural information alone and thus fail to capture the genetic determinants that influence disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. To address this gap, we propose GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that integrates protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug and vaccine development. In our approach, protein-ligand complexes are represented as molecular graphs and modeled using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), while gene sequences are encoded into biologically meaningful embeddings via a pre-trained Transformer (ProtBERT/ESM). These complementary modalities are fused through a multi-layer perceptron to enable robust cross-modal interaction learning. We evaluate the model on benchmark datasets of GI disease-related targets, demonstrating that GastroDL-Fusion significantly improves predictive performance over conventional methods. Specifically, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.12 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.75, outperforming CNN, BiLSTM, GIN, and Transformer-only baselines. These results confirm that incorporating both structural and genetic features yields more accurate predictions of binding affinities, providing a reliable computational tool for accelerating the design of targeted therapies and vaccines in the context of gastrointestinal diseases.

Abstract: We introduce the first formal large-scale assessment of the utility of traditional chemical functional groups as used in chemical explanations. Our assessment employs a fundamental principle from computational learning theory: a good explanation of data should also compress the data. We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm based on the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle that searches for substructures that compress around three million biologically relevant molecules. We demonstrate that the discovered substructures contain most human-curated functional groups as well as novel larger patterns with more specific functions. We also run our algorithm on 24 specific bioactivity prediction datasets to discover dataset-specific functional groups. Fingerprints constructed from dataset-specific functional groups are shown to significantly outperform other fingerprint representations, including the MACCS and Morgan fingerprint, when training ridge regression models on bioactivity regression tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently estimating the mean of a $k$-class random variable, $Y$, using a limited number of labels, $N$, in settings where the analyst has access to auxiliary information (i.e.: covariates) $X$ that may be informative about $Y$. We propose an active learning algorithm ("PartiBandits") to estimate $\mathbb{E}[Y]$. The algorithm yields an estimate, $\widehatμ_{\text{PB}}$, such that $\left( \widehatμ_{\text{PB}} - \mathbb{E}[Y]\right)^2$ is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{ν+ \exp(c \cdot (-N/\log(N))) }{N} \right)$, where $c > 0$ is a constant and $ν$ is the risk of the Bayes-optimal classifier. PartiBandits is essentially a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, it learns a partition of the unlabeled data that shrinks the average conditional variance of $Y$. In the second stage it uses a UCB-style subroutine ("WarmStart-UCB") to request labels from each stratum round-by-round. Both the main algorithm's and the subroutine's convergence rates are minimax optimal in classical settings. PartiBandits bridges the UCB and disagreement-based approaches to active learning despite these two approaches being designed to tackle very different tasks. We illustrate our methods through simulation using nationwide electronic health records. Our methods can be implemented using the PartiBandits package in R.

Motivation: 稀疏自编码器(SAE)在解释大语言模型方面很有效，但高维度导致训练和推理成本过高。现有的MoE方法虽然降低了计算量，但专家网络经常学习重叠特征，缺乏专业化。

Method: 提出两种关键技术：(1)多重专家激活 - 同时激活语义加权的专家子集以促进专业化；(2)特征缩放 - 通过自适应高频缩放增强特征多样性。

Result: 实验显示重构误差降低24%，特征冗余减少99%，相比现有MoE-SAE方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作弥合了LLM分析中的可解释性与效率差距，实现了透明模型检查而不损害计算可行性。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting large language models (LLMs) by decomposing token activations into combinations of human-understandable features. While SAEs provide crucial insights into LLM explanations, their practical adoption faces a fundamental challenge: better interpretability demands that SAEs' hidden layers have high dimensionality to satisfy sparsity constraints, resulting in prohibitive training and inference costs. Recent Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches attempt to address this by partitioning SAEs into narrower expert networks with gated activation, thereby reducing computation. In a well-designed MoE, each expert should focus on learning a distinct set of features. However, we identify a \textit{critical limitation} in MoE-SAE: Experts often fail to specialize, which means they frequently learn overlapping or identical features. To deal with it, we propose two key innovations: (1) Multiple Expert Activation that simultaneously engages semantically weighted expert subsets to encourage specialization, and (2) Feature Scaling that enhances diversity through adaptive high-frequency scaling. Experiments demonstrate a 24\% lower reconstruction error and a 99\% reduction in feature redundancy compared to existing MoE-SAE methods. This work bridges the interpretability-efficiency gap in LLM analysis, allowing transparent model inspection without compromising computational feasibility.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of finding robust and safe policies in Robust Constrained Average-Cost Markov Decision Processes (RCMDPs). A key challenge in this setting is the lack of strong duality, which prevents the direct use of standard primal-dual methods for constrained RL. Additional difficulties arise from the average-cost setting, where the Robust Bellman operator is not a contraction under any norm. To address these challenges, we propose an actor-critic algorithm for Average-Cost RCMDPs. We show that our method achieves both \(ε\)-feasibility and \(ε\)-optimality, and we establish a sample complexities of \(\tilde{O}\left(ε^{-4}\right)\) and \(\tilde{O}\left(ε^{-6}\right)\) with and without slackness assumption, which is comparable to the discounted setting.

Conclusion: 该框架在受限带宽场景下表现出强大的可扩展性，为实际联邦学习部署提供了有效的通信优化解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without exposing clients' private data, but its deployment is often constrained by the communication cost of transmitting gradients between clients and the central server, especially under system heterogeneity where low-bandwidth clients bottleneck overall performance. Lossy compression of gradient data can mitigate this overhead, and error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) is particularly appealing for its fine-grained utility-compression tradeoff. However, existing EBLC methods (e.g., SZ), originally designed for smooth scientific data with strong spatial locality, rely on generic predictors such as Lorenzo and interpolation for entropy reduction to improve compression ratio. Gradient tensors, in contrast, exhibit low smoothness and weak spatial correlation, rendering these predictors ineffective and leading to poor compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose an EBLC framework tailored for FL gradient data to achieve high compression ratios while preserving model accuracy. The core of it is an innovative prediction mechanism that exploits temporal correlations across FL training rounds and structural regularities within convolutional kernels to reduce residual entropy. The predictor is compatible with standard quantizers and entropy coders and comprises (1) a cross-round magnitude predictor based on a normalized exponential moving average, and (2) a sign predictor that leverages gradient oscillation and kernel-level sign consistency. Experiments show that this new EBLC yields up to 1.53x higher compression ratios than SZ3 with lower accuracy loss.

Abstract: Ambient sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) in smart homes remains challenging due to the need for real-time inference, spatially grounded reasoning, and context-aware temporal modeling. Existing approaches often rely on pre-segmented, within-activity data and overlook the physical layout of the environment, limiting their robustness in continuous, real-world deployments. In this paper, we propose MARAuder's Map, a novel framework for real-time activity recognition from raw, unsegmented sensor streams. Our method projects sensor activations onto the physical floorplan to generate trajectory-aware, image-like sequences that capture the spatial flow of human movement. These representations are processed by a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. To enhance temporal awareness, we introduce a learnable time embedding module that encodes contextual cues such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. Additionally, an attention-based encoder selectively focuses on informative segments within each observation window, enabling accurate recognition even under cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world smart home datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines, offering a practical solution for real-time HAR in ambient sensor environments.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control (TSC) policies. Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce interpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent performance.

Conclusion: 在词典序偏好下，结合跨目标信息共享的算法能够超越单目标算法的性能界限，为多目标决策提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In multi-objective decision-making with hierarchical preferences, lexicographic bandits provide a natural framework for optimizing multiple objectives in a prioritized order. In this setting, a learner repeatedly selects arms and observes reward vectors, aiming to maximize the reward for the highest-priority objective, then the next, and so on. While previous studies have primarily focused on regret minimization, this work bridges the gap between \textit{regret minimization} and \textit{best arm identification} under lexicographic preferences. We propose two elimination-based algorithms to address this joint objective. The first algorithm eliminates suboptimal arms sequentially, layer by layer, in accordance with the objective priorities, and achieves sample complexity and regret bounds comparable to those of the best single-objective algorithms. The second algorithm simultaneously leverages reward information from all objectives in each round, effectively exploiting cross-objective dependencies. Remarkably, it outperforms the known lower bound for the single-objective bandit problem, highlighting the benefit of cross-objective information sharing in the multi-objective setting. Empirical results further validate their superior performance over baselines.

Motivation: 在AI社会影响应用中，干预措施会影响结果，导致模型评估存在偏差。随机对照试验虽然能提供无偏评估，但传统方法仅使用对照组数据效率低下，浪费了昂贵的试验数据。

Method: 提出nuisance parameter weighting (NPW)方法，从理论上量化了简单聚合处理组和对照组性能估计的偏差，并推导出导致错误模型选择的条件。NPW通过重新加权处理组数据来模拟无干预情况下的结果分布。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现现实环境中更高效的模型评估迈出了重要一步，能够充分利用随机对照试验的所有数据，提高评估效率。

Abstract: AI models are often evaluated based on their ability to predict the outcome of interest. However, in many AI for social impact applications, the presence of an intervention that affects the outcome can bias the evaluation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign interventions, allowing data from the control group to be used for unbiased model evaluation. However, this approach is inefficient because it ignores data from the treatment group. Given the complexity and cost often associated with RCTs, making the most use of the data is essential. Thus, we investigate model evaluation strategies that leverage all data from an RCT. First, we theoretically quantify the estimation bias that arises from naïvely aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups, and derive the condition under which this bias leads to incorrect model selection. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), an unbiased model evaluation approach that reweights data from the treatment group to mimic the distributions of samples that would or would not experience the outcome under no intervention. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed evaluation approach consistently yields better model selection than the standard approach, which ignores data from the treatment group, across various intervention effect and sample size settings. Our contribution represents a meaningful step towards more efficient model evaluation in real-world contexts.

TL;DR: MOSS是一个新颖的FP8训练框架，通过两级微缩放策略和自动权重缩放，在保持训练性能的同时显著提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP8格式训练能带来显著效率提升，但现有方法存在去量化开销大和在线量化效率低的问题，需要更高效的FP8训练方案。

Method: 提出两级微缩放策略（高精度全局缩放+紧凑的2次幂局部缩放）和线性层自动权重缩放，避免昂贵的最大归约操作。

Result: 在7B参数模型上实现高效FP8训练，性能与BF16基线相当，训练吞吐量提升高达34%。

Conclusion: MOSS框架成功解决了FP8训练中的效率和数值稳定性挑战，为大规模语言模型训练提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Training large language models with FP8 formats offers significant efficiency gains. However, the reduced numerical precision of FP8 poses challenges for stable and accurate training. Current frameworks preserve training performance using mixed-granularity quantization, i.e., applying per-group quantization for activations and per-tensor/block quantization for weights. While effective, per-group quantization requires scaling along the inner dimension of matrix multiplication, introducing additional dequantization overhead. Moreover, these frameworks often rely on just-in-time scaling to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on the current data distribution. However, this online quantization is inefficient for FP8 training, as it involves multiple memory reads and writes that negate the performance benefits of FP8. To overcome these limitations, we propose MOSS, a novel FP8 training framework that ensures both efficiency and numerical stability. MOSS introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, which balances precision and dequantization cost by combining a high-precision global scale with compact, power-of-two local scales; and (2) automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, which eliminates the need for costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training. Leveraging these techniques, MOSS enables efficient FP8 training of a 7B parameter model, achieving performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while achieving up to 34% higher training throughput.

Abstract: In today's landscape, Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a crucial architecture that has been used by many of the most advanced models. One of the major challenges of MoE models is that they usually require much more memory than their dense counterparts due to their unique architecture, and hence are harder to deploy in environments with limited GPU memory, such as edge devices. MoE offloading is a promising technique proposed to overcome this challenge, especially if it is enhanced with caching and pre-fetching, but prior work stopped at suboptimal caching algorithm and offered limited insights. In this work, we study MoE offloading in depth and make the following contributions: 1. We analyze the expert activation and LRU caching behavior in detail and provide traces. 2. We propose LFU caching optimization based on our analysis and obtain strong improvements from LRU. 3. We implement and experiment speculative expert pre-fetching, providing detailed trace showing its huge potential . 4. In addition, our study extensively covers the behavior of the MoE architecture itself, offering information on the characteristic of the gating network and experts. This can inspire future work on the interpretation of MoE models and the development of pruning techniques for MoE architecture with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that artificial intelligence (AI) can assist electronic design automation (EDA) in improving both the quality and efficiency of chip design. But current AI for EDA (AI-EDA) infrastructures remain fragmented, lacking comprehensive solutions for the entire data pipeline from design execution to AI integration. Key challenges include fragmented flow engines that generate raw data, heterogeneous file formats for data exchange, non-standardized data extraction methods, and poorly organized data storage. This work introduces a unified open-source library for EDA (AiEDA) that addresses these issues. AiEDA integrates multiple design-to-vector data representation techniques that transform diverse chip design data into universal multi-level vector representations, establishing an AI-aided design (AAD) paradigm optimized for AI-EDA workflows. AiEDA provides complete physical design flows with programmatic data extraction and standardized Python interfaces bridging EDA datasets and AI frameworks. Leveraging the AiEDA library, we generate iDATA, a 600GB dataset of structured data derived from 50 real chip designs (28nm), and validate its effectiveness through seven representative AAD tasks spanning prediction, generation, optimization and analysis. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/OSCC-Project/AiEDA, while the full iDATA dataset is being prepared for public release, providing a foundation for future AI-EDA research.

TL;DR: 提出PFRP方法，通过检索全局历史数据来增强单变量时间序列预测的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在推理时只能依赖滑动窗口的局部上下文，无法显式访问全局历史知识，导致丰富的全局模式未被充分利用

Method: 构建全局记忆库(GMB)存储历史模式，使用检索机制提取相似模式生成全局预测，然后与局部预测模型输出自适应结合

Result: 在7个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，PFRP将先进单变量预测模型的平均性能提升了8.4%

Conclusion: PFRP通过显式集成全局历史数据，能够产生更准确和可解释的预测，有效弥补了现有模型的局限性

Abstract: Deep learning models such as MLP, Transformer, and TCN have achieved remarkable success in univariate time series forecasting, typically relying on sliding window samples from historical data for training. However, while these models implicitly compress historical information into their parameters during training, they are unable to explicitly and dynamically access this global knowledge during inference, relying only on the local context within the lookback window. This results in an underutilization of rich patterns from the global history. To bridge this gap, we propose Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP), a novel approach that explicitly integrates global historical data to enhance forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to effectively store and manage global historical patterns. A retrieval mechanism is then employed to extract similar patterns from the GMB, enabling the generation of global predictions. By adaptively combining these global predictions with the outputs of any local prediction model, PFRP produces more accurate and interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that PFRP significantly enhances the average performance of advanced univariate forecasting models by 8.4\%.

Conclusion: EMOD框架能够有效学习可迁移的情感感知表示，在多样化的EEG情感识别场景中表现出优异的泛化性能

Abstract: Emotion recognition from EEG signals is essential for affective computing and has been widely explored using deep learning. While recent deep learning approaches have achieved strong performance on single EEG emotion datasets, their generalization across datasets remains limited due to the heterogeneity in annotation schemes and data formats. Existing models typically require dataset-specific architectures tailored to input structure and lack semantic alignment across diverse emotion labels. To address these challenges, we propose EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning. EMOD learns transferable and emotion-aware representations from heterogeneous datasets by bridging both semantic and structural gaps. Specifically, we project discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space and formulate a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss that encourages emotionally similar samples to cluster in the latent space. To accommodate variable EEG formats, EMOD employs a flexible backbone comprising a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, enabling robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial features. We pretrain EMOD on eight public EEG datasets and evaluate its performance on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that EMOD achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong adaptability and generalization across diverse EEG-based emotion recognition scenarios.

Conclusion: TabPFN是在训练资源受限和快速部署需求下解决结构化组合优化问题的有前景方法。

Abstract: Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Network (TabPFN) is a foundation model designed for small to medium-sized tabular data, which has attracted much attention recently. This paper investigates the application of TabPFN in Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems. The aim is to lessen challenges in time and data-intensive training requirements often observed in using traditional methods including exact and heuristic algorithms, Machine Learning (ML)-based models, to solve CO problems. Proposing possibly the first ever application of TabPFN for such a purpose, we adapt and fine-tune the TabPFN model to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), one of the most well-known CO problems. Specifically, we adopt the node-based approach and the node-predicting adaptation strategy to construct the entire TSP route. Our evaluation with varying instance sizes confirms that TabPFN requires minimal training, adapts to TSP using a single sample, performs better generalization across varying TSP instance sizes, and reduces performance degradation. Furthermore, the training process with adaptation and fine-tuning is completed within minutes. The methodology leads to strong solution quality even without post-processing and achieves performance comparable to other models with post-processing refinement. Our findings suggest that the TabPFN model is a promising approach to solve structured and CO problems efficiently under training resource constraints and rapid deployment requirements.

Conclusion: FusionLog通过有效融合通用和专有知识，实现了无需目标系统标注数据的跨系统日志异常检测，解决了现有方法的知识不匹配问题。

Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection is critical for ensuring the stability and reliability of web systems. One of the key problems in this task is the lack of sufficient labeled logs, which limits the rapid deployment in new systems. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from a mature web system and a small amount of labeled logs from a new system, using transfer learning to extract and generalize general knowledge across both domains. However, these methods focus solely on the transfer of general knowledge and neglect the disparity and potential mismatch between such knowledge and the proprietary knowledge of target system, thus constraining performance. To address this limitation, we propose FusionLog, a novel zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection method that effectively achieves the fusion of general and proprietary knowledge, enabling cross-system generalization without any labeled target logs. Specifically, we first design a training-free router based on semantic similarity that dynamically partitions unlabeled target logs into 'general logs' and 'proprietary logs.' For general logs, FusionLog employs a small model based on system-agnostic representation meta-learning for direct training and inference, inheriting the general anomaly patterns shared between the source and target systems. For proprietary logs, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels and fine-tune the small model using multi-round collaborative knowledge distillation and fusion based on large language model (LLM) and small model (SM) to enhance its capability to recognize anomaly patterns specific to the target system. Experimental results on three public log datasets from different systems show that FusionLog achieves over 90% F1-score under a fully zero-label setting, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art cross-system log-based anomaly detection methods.

Abstract: Green hydrogen production via polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is pivotal for energy transition, yet hydrogen crossover through membranes threatens safety and economic viability-approaching explosive limits (4 mol% H$_2$ in O$_2$) while reducing Faradaic efficiency by 2.5%. Current physics-based models require extensive calibration and computational resources that preclude real-time implementation, while purely data-driven approaches fail to extrapolate beyond training conditions-critical for dynamic electrolyzer operation. Here we present the first application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for hydrogen crossover prediction, integrating mass conservation, Fick's diffusion law, and Henry's solubility law within a compact architecture (17,793 parameters). Validated across six membranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar, 25-85°C), our PINN achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84%, RMSE = 0.0348%) with sub-millisecond inference times suitable for real-time control. Remarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at pressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural networks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs to edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring essential for gigawatt-scale installations. By bridging physical rigor and computational efficiency, this work establishes a new paradigm for real-time electrolyzer monitoring, accelerating deployment of safe, efficient green hydrogen infrastructure crucial for net-zero emissions targets.

Abstract: We introduce a unified attention-based framework for joint score and density estimation. Framing the problem as a sequence-to-sequence task, we develop a permutation- and affine-equivariant transformer that estimates both the probability density $f(x)$ and its score $\nabla_x \log f(x)$ directly from i.i.d. samples. Unlike traditional score-matching methods that require training a separate model for each distribution, our approach learns a single distribution-agnostic operator that generalizes across densities and sample sizes. The architecture employs cross-attention to connect observed samples with arbitrary query points, enabling generalization beyond the training data, while built-in symmetry constraints ensure equivariance to permutation and affine transformations. Analytically, we show that the attention weights can recover classical kernel density estimation (KDE), and verify it empirically, establishing a principled link between classical KDE and the transformer architecture. Empirically, the model achieves substantially lower error and better scaling than KDE and score-debiased KDE (SD-KDE), while exhibiting better runtime scaling. Together, these results establish transformers as general-purpose, data-adaptive operators for nonparametric density and score estimation.

Abstract: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have an increased risk of hospitalizations, strongly associated with decreased survival, yet predicting the timing of these events remains challenging and has received limited attention in the literature. In this study, we performed survival analysis to predict hospitalization and death in COPD patients using longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), comparing statistical models, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches. We analyzed data from more than 150k patients from the SIDIAP database in Catalonia, Spain, from 2013 to 2017, modeling hospitalization as a first event and death as a semi-competing terminal event. Multiple models were evaluated, including Cox proportional hazards, SurvivalBoost, DeepPseudo, SurvTRACE, Dynamic Deep-Hit, and Deep Recurrent Survival Machine. Results showed that DL models utilizing recurrent architectures outperformed both ML and linear approaches in concordance and time-dependent AUC, especially for hospitalization, which proved to be the harder event to predict. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to apply deep survival analysis on longitudinal EHR data to jointly predict multiple time-to-event outcomes in COPD patients, highlighting the potential of DL approaches to capture temporal patterns and improve risk stratification.

TL;DR: NextLat通过引入潜在空间自监督预测，为Transformer注入循环归纳偏置，使其学习压缩的历史表示（信念状态），从而提升泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer缺乏压缩历史为紧凑潜在状态的固有激励，导致学习解决方案泛化能力差。需要让Transformer形成具有自身信念状态和转移动态的紧凑内部世界模型

Method: NextLat在标准下一词元训练基础上，增加潜在空间的自监督预测。训练Transformer学习能够预测给定下一输出词元时下一潜在状态的潜在表示

Result: 在针对核心序列建模能力的基准测试中（世界建模、推理、规划、语言建模），NextLat在下游准确性、表示压缩和前瞻规划方面显著优于标准下一词元训练

Conclusion: NextLat是一个简单高效的范式，能够将Transformer表示塑造成具有更强泛化能力的信念状态，同时保持其架构、并行训练和推理不变

Abstract: Transformers replace recurrence with a memory that grows with sequence length and self-attention that enables ad-hoc look ups over past tokens. Consequently, they lack an inherent incentive to compress history into compact latent states with consistent transition rules. This often leads to learning solutions that generalize poorly. We introduce Next-Latent Prediction (NextLat), which extends standard next-token training with self-supervised predictions in the latent space. Specifically, NextLat trains a transformer to learn latent representations that are predictive of its next latent state given the next output token. Theoretically, we show that these latents provably converge to belief states, compressed information of the history necessary to predict the future. This simple auxiliary objective also injects a recurrent inductive bias into transformers, while leaving their architecture, parallel training, and inference unchanged. NextLat effectively encourages the transformer to form compact internal world models with its own belief states and transition dynamics -- a crucial property absent in standard next-token prediction transformers. Empirically, across benchmarks targeting core sequence modeling competencies -- world modeling, reasoning, planning, and language modeling -- NextLat demonstrates significant gains over standard next-token training in downstream accuracy, representation compression, and lookahead planning. NextLat stands as a simple and efficient paradigm for shaping transformer representations toward stronger generalization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断树方法和机器学习方法在副传导通路定位上存在解剖定位分辨率有限、可解释性差、数据集小等限制，需要更准确、透明的非侵入性定位方法。

Method: 使用个性化虚拟心脏模型生成的大规模合成心电图数据库训练深度学习模型，并结合Guided Backpropagation、Grad-CAM和Guided Grad-CAM等可解释人工智能方法。

Result: 模型在24个心脏区域的定位准确率超过95%，敏感性94.32%，特异性99.78%。V2导联被确定为最关键，其次是aVF、V1和aVL导联。

Conclusion: 心脏数字孪生与可解释深度学习相结合，能够实现准确、透明、非侵入性的副传导通路定位，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a cardiac electrophysiology (EP) disorder caused by the presence of an accessory pathway (AP) that bypasses the atrioventricular node, faster ventricular activation rate, and provides a substrate for atrio-ventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). Accurate localization of the AP is critical for planning and guiding catheter ablation procedures. While traditional diagnostic tree (DT) methods and more recent machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to predict AP location from surface electrocardiogram (ECG), they are often constrained by limited anatomical localization resolution, poor interpretability, and the use of small clinical datasets. In this study, we present a Deep Learning (DL) model for the localization of single manifest APs across 24 cardiac regions, trained on a large, physiologically realistic database of synthetic ECGs generated using a personalized virtual heart model. We also integrate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM, into the pipeline. This enables interpretation of DL decision-making and addresses one of the main barriers to clinical adoption: lack of transparency in ML predictions. Our model achieves localization accuracy above 95%, with a sensitivity of 94.32% and specificity of 99.78%. XAI outputs are physiologically validated against known depolarization patterns, and a novel index is introduced to identify the most informative ECG leads for AP localization. Results highlight lead V2 as the most critical, followed by aVF, V1, and aVL. This work demonstrates the potential of combining cardiac digital twins with explainable DL to enable accurate, transparent, and non-invasive AP localization.

Abstract: Anomaly troubleshooting for large model distributed inference (LMDI) remains a critical challenge. Resolving anomalies such as inference performance degradation or latency jitter in distributed system demands significant manual efforts from domain experts, resulting in extremely time-consuming diagnosis processes with relatively low accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Kunlun Anomaly Troubleshooter (KAT), the first anomaly troubleshooting framework tailored for LMDI. KAT addresses this problem through two core innovations. First, KAT exploits the synchronicity and consistency of GPU workers, innovatively leverages function trace data to precisely detect kernel-level anomalies and associated hardware components at nanosecond resolution. Second, KAT integrates these detection results into a domain-adapted LLM, delivering systematic causal reasoning and natural language interpretation of complex anomaly symptoms. Evaluations conducted in Alibaba Cloud Service production environment indicate that KAT achieves over 0.884 precision and 0.936 recall in anomaly detection, providing detail anomaly insights that significantly narrow down the diagnostic scope and improve both the efficiency and success rate of troubleshooting.

Motivation: 时间序列插补的基础模型研究尚不充分，最近出现的TabPFN-TS和MoTM模型采用时间索引方法，但缺乏系统评估。本文旨在填补这一空白，验证这类模型在零样本设置下的实用性。

Method: 在33个域外数据集（约130万个插补窗口）上进行广泛的单变量实验，评估模型在不重新训练的情况下整合协变量以提高插补精度的能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，时间索引基础模型在零样本插补任务中表现强大且实用，能够有效恢复缺失值并利用协变量提升精度。

Conclusion: 时间索引基础模型是实现通用、零样本时间序列插补的重要一步，为实际应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Foundation models for time series imputation remain largely unexplored. Recently, two such models, TabPFN-TS and MoTM, have emerged. These models share a common philosophy that places them within the family of time-indexed foundation models. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of these models for zero-shot imputation, which enables missing value recovery without retraining across a wide range of scenarios. We conduct extensive univariate experiments across 33 out-of-domain datasets (approximately 1.3M imputation windows) and evaluate their ability to integrate covariates at inference time to improve accuracy without fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate that time-indexed foundation models are a powerful and practical step toward achieving general-purpose, zero-shot imputation for real-world time series.

Conclusion: 该技术为可访问、可持续和贴合式医疗可穿戴设备提供了有前景的路径，充分利用了柔性技术的低制造成本优势。

Abstract: Flexible electronics offer unique advantages for conformable, lightweight, and disposable healthcare wearables. However, their limited gate count, large feature sizes, and high static power consumption make on-body machine learning classification highly challenging. While existing bendable RISC-V systems provide compact solutions, they lack the energy efficiency required. We present a mechanically flexible RISC-V that integrates a bespoke multiply-accumulate co-processor with fixed coefficients to maximize energy efficiency and minimize latency. Our approach formulates a constrained programming problem to jointly determine co-processor constants and optimally map Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) inference operations, enabling compact, model-specific hardware by leveraging the low fabrication and non-recurring engineering costs of flexible technologies. Post-layout results demonstrate near-real-time performance across several healthcare datasets, with our circuits operating within the power budget of existing flexible batteries and occupying only 2.42 mm^2, offering a promising path toward accessible, sustainable, and conformable healthcare wearables. Our microprocessors achieve an average 2.35x speedup and 2.15x lower energy consumption compared to the state of the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM中不断增长的上下文长度导致的KV缓存性能瓶颈问题，该内存受限特性导致GPU利用率低下。

Method: 采用混合共享KV注意力架构，包含共享KV注意力机制、MoE启发的稀疏注意力策略和专门化硬件基础设施。

Result: 在高上下文共享工作负载中，吞吐量相比基线提升高达538.7倍。

Conclusion: MoSKA为可扩展的LLM推理提供了一条清晰的架构路径。

Abstract: The escalating context length in Large Language Models (LLMs) creates a severe performance bottleneck around the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose memory-bound nature leads to significant GPU under-utilization. This paper introduces Mixture of Shared KV Attention (MoSKA), an architecture that addresses this challenge by exploiting the heterogeneity of context data. It differentiates between per-request unique and massively reused shared sequences. The core of MoSKA is a novel Shared KV Attention mechanism that transforms the attention on shared data from a series of memory-bound GEMV operations into a single, compute-bound GEMM by batching concurrent requests. This is supported by an MoE-inspired sparse attention strategy that prunes the search space and a tailored Disaggregated Infrastructure that specializes hardware for unique and shared data. This comprehensive approach demonstrates a throughput increase of up to 538.7x over baselines in workloads with high context sharing, offering a clear architectural path toward scalable LLM inference.

TL;DR: Lethe是一个动态KV缓存管理框架，通过空间维度的层级稀疏感知分配和时间维度的多轮token剪枝，有效减少生成式推理中的内存和延迟开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式推理中长解码序列导致KV缓存积累，造成显著内存和延迟开销。现有KV压缩方法主要关注减少长输入序列的预填充内存，但无法有效处理长文本生成的动态和层级敏感特性。

Method: Lethe框架在空间维度进行层级稀疏感知分配，根据估计的注意力冗余为每个transformer层分配token剪枝预算；在时间维度通过基于最近性感知选择性保留(RASR)机制进行多轮token剪枝，结合最近性启发式和从演化注意力模式中提取的token相关性。

Result: Lethe在不同模型和任务上实现了效率和生成质量的良好平衡，吞吐量最高提升2.56倍。

Conclusion: Lethe通过空间和时间维度的自适应KV缓存管理，有效解决了长文本生成推理中的内存和延迟问题，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Generative reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often involves long decoding sequences, leading to substantial memory and latency overheads from accumulating key-value (KV) caches. While existing KV compression methods primarily focus on reducing prefill memory from long input sequences, they fall short in addressing the dynamic and layer-sensitive nature of long-form generation, which is central to reasoning tasks. We propose Lethe, a dynamic KV cache management framework that introduces adaptivity along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of decoding. Along the spatial dimension, Lethe performs layerwise sparsity-aware allocation, assigning token pruning budgets to each transformer layer based on estimated attention redundancy. Along the temporal dimension, Lethe conducts multi-round token pruning during generation, driven by a Recency-Aware Selective Retention} (RASR) mechanism. RASR extends traditional recency-based heuristics by also considering token relevance derived from evolving attention patterns, enabling informed decisions about which tokens to retain or evict. Empirical results demonstrate that Lethe achieves a favorable balance between efficiency and generation quality across diverse models and tasks, increases throughput by up to 2.56x.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MTPP模型使用通道混合策略，将不同事件类型信息编码到单一固定大小的潜在表示中，这种纠缠会模糊类型特定的动态，导致性能下降和过拟合风险增加。

Method: 提出ITPP架构，使用编码器-解码器框架和ODE骨干网络，采用类型感知的反转自注意力机制来显式建模异构事件类型间的通道间相关性。

Result: 在多个真实世界和合成数据集上的综合实验表明，ITPP在预测准确性和泛化能力方面始终优于最先进的MTPP模型。

Conclusion: ITPP通过通道独立架构有效提升了MTPP建模的效果和鲁棒性，同时减少了过拟合。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPPs) provide a principled framework for modeling asynchronous event sequences by conditioning on the history of past events. However, most existing MTPP models rely on channel-mixing strategies that encode information from different event types into a single, fixed-size latent representation. This entanglement can obscure type-specific dynamics, leading to performance degradation and increased risk of overfitting. In this work, we introduce ITPP, a novel channel-independent architecture for MTPP modeling that decouples event type information using an encoder-decoder framework with an ODE-based backbone. Central to ITPP is a type-aware inverted self-attention mechanism, designed to explicitly model inter-channel correlations among heterogeneous event types. This architecture enhances effectiveness and robustness while reducing overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that ITPP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MTPP models in both predictive accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient global ocean state estimation remains a grand challenge for Earth system science, hindered by the dual bottlenecks of computational scalability and degraded data fidelity in traditional data assimilation (DA) and deep learning (DL) approaches. Here we present an AI-driven Data Assimilation Framework for Ocean (ADAF-Ocean) that directly assimilates multi-source and multi-scale observations, ranging from sparse in-situ measurements to 4 km satellite swaths, without any interpolation or data thinning. Inspired by Neural Processes, ADAF-Ocean learns a continuous mapping from heterogeneous inputs to ocean states, preserving native data fidelity. Through AI-driven super-resolution, it reconstructs 0.25$^\circ$ mesoscale dynamics from coarse 1$^\circ$ fields, which ensures both efficiency and scalability, with just 3.7\% more parameters than the 1$^\circ$ configuration. When coupled with a DL forecasting system, ADAF-Ocean extends global forecast skill by up to 20 days compared to baselines without assimilation. This framework establishes a computationally viable and scientifically rigorous pathway toward real-time, high-resolution Earth system monitoring.

Abstract: We propose a consistency model based on the optimal-transport flow. A physics-informed design of partially input-convex neural networks (PICNN) plays a central role in constructing the flow field that emulates the displacement interpolation.

Our approach avoids inner optimization subproblems that are present in previous one-step OFM approaches. During the prediction stage, our approach supports both one-step (Brenier-map) and multi-step ODE sampling from the same learned potential, leveraging the straightness of the OT flow. We validate scalability and performance on standard OT benchmarks.

Abstract: Attention mechanism is a significant part of Transformer models. It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability. Although several researches have provided attention mechanism in sparse form, they are lack of theoretical analysis about the expressivity of their mechanism while reducing complexity. In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms. (3) Random Batch Attention mechanism has theoretical explanation in convergence, as it comes from Random Batch Methods on computation mathematics. Experiments on large graphs have proved advantages mentioned above. Also, the theoretical modeling of self-attention mechanism is a new tool for future research on attention-mechanism analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了表格数据的严重安全漏洞，能够成功规避最先进的防御机制，包括Spectral Signatures、Neural Cleanse、Beatrix和Fine-Pruning等。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks in machine learning have drawn significant attention for their potential to compromise models stealthily, yet most research has focused on homogeneous data such as images. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on tabular data, which is particularly challenging due to the presence of both numerical and categorical features. Our key idea is a novel technique to convert categorical values into floating-point representations. This approach preserves enough information to maintain clean-model accuracy compared to traditional methods like one-hot or ordinal encoding. By doing this, we create a gradient-based universal perturbation that applies to all features, including categorical ones.
  We evaluate our method on five datasets and four popular models. Our results show up to a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box settings (including real-world applications like Vertex AI), revealing a severe vulnerability for tabular data. Our method is shown to surpass the previous works like Tabdoor in terms of performance, while remaining stealthy against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. We evaluate our attack against Spectral Signatures, Neural Cleanse, Beatrix, and Fine-Pruning, all of which fail to defend successfully against it. We also verify that our attack successfully bypasses popular outlier detection mechanisms.

Abstract: Short-video recommenders such as Douyin must exploit extremely long user histories without breaking latency or cost budgets. We present an end-to-end system that scales long-sequence modeling to 10k-length histories in production. First, we introduce Stacked Target-to-History Cross Attention (STCA), which replaces history self-attention with stacked cross-attention from the target to the history, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length and enabling efficient end-to-end training. Second, we propose Request Level Batching (RLB), a user-centric batching scheme that aggregates multiple targets for the same user/request to share the user-side encoding, substantially lowering sequence-related storage, communication, and compute without changing the learning objective. Third, we design a length-extrapolative training strategy -- train on shorter windows, infer on much longer ones -- so the model generalizes to 10k histories without additional training cost. Across offline and online experiments, we observe predictable, monotonic gains as we scale history length and model capacity, mirroring the scaling law behavior observed in large language models. Deployed at full traffic on Douyin, our system delivers significant improvements on key engagement metrics while meeting production latency, demonstrating a practical path to scaling end-to-end long-sequence recommendation to the 10k regime.

Abstract: Reliability analysis of engineering systems under uncertainty poses significant computational challenges, particularly for problems involving high-dimensional stochastic inputs, nonlinear system responses, and multiphysics couplings. Traditional surrogate modeling approaches often incur high energy consumption, which severely limits their scalability and deployability in resource-constrained environments. We introduce NeuroPOL, \textit{the first neuroscience-inspired physics-informed operator learning framework} for reliability analysis. NeuroPOL incorporates Variable Spiking Neurons into a physics-informed operator architecture, replacing continuous activations with event-driven spiking dynamics. This innovation promotes sparse communication, significantly reduces computational load, and enables an energy-efficient surrogate model. The proposed framework lowers both computational and power demands, supporting real-time reliability assessment and deployment on edge devices and digital twins. By embedding governing physical laws into operator learning, NeuroPOL builds physics-consistent surrogates capable of accurate uncertainty propagation and efficient failure probability estimation, even for high-dimensional problems. We evaluate NeuroPOL on five canonical benchmarks, the Burgers equation, Nagumo equation, two-dimensional Poisson equation, two-dimensional Darcy equation, and incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with energy coupling. Results show that NeuroPOL achieves reliability measures comparable to standard physics-informed operators, while introducing significant communication sparsity, enabling scalable, distributed, and energy-efficient deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable success in complex decision-making environments, yet its lack of transparency limits its deployment in practice, especially in safety-critical settings. Shapley values from cooperative game theory provide a principled framework for explaining reinforcement learning; however, the computational cost of Shapley explanations is an obstacle to their use. We introduce FastSVERL, a scalable method for explaining reinforcement learning by approximating Shapley values. FastSVERL is designed to handle the unique challenges of reinforcement learning, including temporal dependencies across multi-step trajectories, learning from off-policy data, and adapting to evolving agent behaviours in real time. FastSVERL introduces a practical, scalable approach for principled and rigorous interpretability in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Web agents struggle to adapt to new websites due to the scarcity of environment specific tasks and demonstrations. Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, we refine tasks when conflicts with actual observations are detected, mitigating hallucinations while maintaining task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with a global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment. Experimental results demonstrate that SynthAgent outperforms existing synthetic data methods, validating the importance of high-quality synthetic supervision. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/SynthAgent.

Abstract: We study the sequential decision-making problem for automated weaning of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices in cardiogenic shock patients. MCS devices are percutaneous micro-axial flow pumps that provide left ventricular unloading and forward blood flow, but current weaning strategies vary significantly across care teams and lack data-driven approaches. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be successful in sequential decision-making tasks, but our setting presents challenges for training and evaluating traditional offline RL methods: prohibition of online patient interaction, highly uncertain circulatory dynamics due to concurrent treatments, and limited data availability. We developed an end-to-end machine learning framework with two key contributions (1) Clinically-aware OOD-regularized Model-based Policy Optimization (CORMPO), a density-regularized offline RL algorithm for out-of-distribution suppression that also incorporates clinically-informed reward shaping and (2) a Transformer-based probabilistic digital twin that models MCS circulatory dynamics for policy evaluation with rich physiological and clinical metrics. We prove that \textsf{CORMPO} achieves theoretical performance guarantees under mild assumptions. CORMPO attains a higher reward than the offline RL baselines by 28% and higher scores in clinical metrics by 82.6% on real and synthetic datasets. Our approach offers a principled framework for safe offline policy learning in high-stakes medical applications where domain expertise and safety constraints are essential.

Abstract: As learning models continue to grow in size, enabling on-device local training of these models has emerged as a critical challenge in federated learning. A popular solution is sub-model training, where the server only distributes randomly sampled sub-models to the edge clients, and clients only update these small models. However, those random sampling of sub-models may not give satisfying convergence performance. In this paper, observing the success of SGD with shuffling, we propose a distributed shuffled sub-model training, where the full model is partitioned into several sub-models in advance, and the server shuffles those sub-models, sends each of them to clients at each round, and by the end of local updating period, clients send back the updated sub-models, and server averages them. We establish the convergence rate of this algorithm. We also study the generalization of distributed sub-model training via stability analysis, and find that the sub-model training can improve the generalization via amplifying the stability of training process. The extensive experiments also validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: With the increase of data in day-to-day life, businesses and different stakeholders need to analyze the data for better predictions. Traditionally, relational data has been a source of various insights, but with the increase in computational power and the need to understand deeper relationships between entities, the need to design new techniques has arisen. For this graph data analysis has become an extraordinary tool for understanding the data, which reveals more realistic and flexible modelling of complex relationships. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and more. However, many adversarial attacks can happen over the data, whether during training (poisoning attack) or during testing (evasion attack), which can adversely manipulate the desired outcome from the GNN model. Therefore, it is crucial to make the GNNs robust to such attacks. The existing robustness methods are computationally demanding and perform poorly when the intensity of attack increases. This paper presents a computationally efficient framework, namely, pLAPGNN, based on weighted p-Laplacian for making GNNs robust. Empirical evaluation on real datasets establishes the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: A promising alternative to the computationally expensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS) involves the development of \textit{Zero Cost Proxies (ZCPs)}, which correlate well to trained performance, but can be computed through a single forward/backward pass on a randomly sampled batch of data. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of ZCPs for HAR on six benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that they discover network architectures that obtain within 5\% of performance attained by full scale training involving 1500 randomly sampled architectures. This results in substantial computational savings as high performing architectures can be discovered with minimal training. Our experiments not only introduce ZCPs to sensor-based HAR, but also demonstrate that they are robust to data noise, further showcasing their suitability for practical scenarios.

Abstract: Transfer learning of tabular data is non-trivial due to heterogeneity in the feature space across disparate domains. The limited success of traditional deep learning in tabular knowledge transfer can be advanced by leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, the efficacy of LLMs often stagnates for mixed data types structured in tables due to the limitations of text prompts and in-context learning. We propose a lightweight transfer learning framework that fine-tunes an LLM using source tabular data and transplants the LLM's selective $key$ and $value$ projection weights into a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT) built for tabular data. The gFTT model with cross-domain attention is fine-tuned using target tabular data for transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models. Our experiments using ten pairs of source-target data sets and 12 baselines demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LLM-attention transplant for transfer learning (LATTLE) method over traditional ML models, state-of-the-art deep tabular architectures, and transfer learning models trained on thousands to billions of tabular samples. The proposed attention transfer demonstrates an effective solution to learning relationships between data tables using an LLM in a low-resource learning environment. The source code for the proposed method is publicly available.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the topology of a directed Gaussian Graphical Model under the equal-variance assumption, where the graph has $n$ nodes and maximum in-degree $d$. Prior work has established that $O(d \log n)$ samples are sufficient for this task. However, an important factor that is often overlooked in these analyses is the dependence on the condition number of the covariance matrix of the model. Indeed, all algorithms from prior work require a number of samples that grows polynomially with this condition number. In many cases this is unsatisfactory, since the condition number could grow polynomially with $n$, rendering these prior approaches impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we provide an algorithm that recovers the underlying graph and prove that the number of samples required is independent of the condition number. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds that nearly match the upper bound up to a $d$-factor, thus providing an almost tight characterization of the true sample complexity of the problem. Moreover, under a further assumption that all the variances of the variables are bounded, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that recovers the underlying graph, at the cost of an additional polynomial dependence of the sample complexity on $d$. We complement our theoretical findings with simulations on synthetic datasets that confirm our predictions.

Conclusion: 该方法不需要预训练模型和分类器骨干网络共享相同架构，具有架构无关性，在噪声联邦学习场景中有效提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning on clients with noisy labels is a challenging problem, as such clients can infiltrate the global model, impacting the overall generalizability of the system. Existing methods proposed to handle noisy clients assume that a sufficient number of clients with clean labels are available, which can be leveraged to learn a robust global model while dampening the impact of noisy clients. This assumption fails when a high number of heterogeneous clients contain noisy labels, making the existing approaches ineffective. In such scenarios, it is important to locally regularize the clients before communication with the global model, to ensure the global model isn't corrupted by noisy clients. While pre-trained self-supervised models can be effective for local regularization, existing centralized approaches relying on pretrained initialization are impractical in a federated setting due to the potentially large size of these models, which increases communication costs. In that line, we propose a regularization objective for client models that decouples the pre-trained and classification models by enforcing similarity between close data points within the client. We leverage the representation space of a self-supervised pretrained model to evaluate the closeness among examples. This regularization, when applied with the standard objective function for the downstream task in standard noisy federated settings, significantly improves performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art federated methods in multiple computer vision and medical image classification benchmarks. Unlike other techniques that rely on self-supervised pretrained initialization, our method does not require the pretrained model and classifier backbone to share the same architecture, making it architecture-agnostic.

Abstract: Supply chains are integral to global economic stability, yet disruptions can swiftly propagate through interconnected networks, resulting in substantial economic impacts. Accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience the capability to maintain core functions during disruptions is crucial for proactive risk mitigation and robust network design. However, existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to infer supply chain resilience without explicit system dynamics and struggle to represent the higher-order, multi-entity dependencies inherent in supply chain networks. These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SC-RIHN significantly outperforms traditional MLP, representative graph neural network variants, and ResInf baselines across synthetic benchmarks, underscoring its potential for practical, early-warning risk assessment in complex supply chain systems.

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) learns node and graph representations by contrasting multiple views of the same graph. Existing methods typically rely on fixed, handcrafted views-usually a local and a global perspective, which limits their ability to capture multi-scale structural patterns. We present an augmentation-free, multi-view GCL framework grounded in fractional-order continuous dynamics. By varying the fractional derivative order $α\in (0,1]$, our encoders produce a continuous spectrum of views: small $α$ yields localized features, while large $α$ induces broader, global aggregation. We treat $α$ as a learnable parameter so the model can adapt diffusion scales to the data and automatically discover informative views. This principled approach generates diverse, complementary representations without manual augmentations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method produces more robust and expressive embeddings and outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines.

Abstract: This paper focuses on dynamic origin-destination matrix estimation (DODE), a crucial calibration process necessary for the effective application of microscopic traffic simulations. The fundamental challenge of the DODE problem in microscopic simulations stems from the complex temporal dynamics and inherent uncertainty of individual vehicle dynamics. This makes it highly challenging to precisely determine which vehicle traverses which link at any given moment, resulting in intricate and often ambiguous relationships between origin-destination (OD) matrices and their contributions to resultant link flows. This phenomenon constitutes the credit assignment problem, a central challenge addressed in this study. We formulate the DODE problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel framework that applies model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Within our proposed framework, the agent learns an optimal policy to sequentially generate OD matrices, refining its strategy through direct interaction with the simulation environment. The proposed method is validated on the Nguyen-Dupuis network using SUMO, where its performance is evaluated against ground-truth link flows aggregated at 5-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 43.2% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to the best-performing conventional baseline. By reframing DODE as a sequential decision-making problem, our approach addresses the credit assignment challenge through its learned policy, thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional methods and proposing a novel framework for calibration of microscopic traffic simulations.

Abstract: Human-computer interaction increasingly demands systems that recognize not only explicit user inputs but also implicit emotional states. While substantial progress has been made in affective computing, most emotion recognition systems rely on cloud-based inference, introducing privacy vulnerabilities and latency constraints unsuitable for real-time applications. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning architectures for on-device emotion recognition from wrist-based photoplethysmography (PPG), systematically comparing different models spanning classical ensemble methods, deep neural networks, and transformers on the WESAD stress detection dataset. Results demonstrate that classical ensemble methods substantially outperform deep learning on small physiological datasets, with ExtraTrees achieving F1 = 0.826 on combined features and F1 = 0.623 on wrist-only features, compared to transformers achieving only F1 = 0.509-0.577. We deploy the wrist-only ExtraTrees model optimized via ONNX conversion, achieving a 4.08 MB footprint, 0.05 ms inference latency, and 152x speedup over the original implementation. Furthermore, ONNX optimization yields a 30.5% average storage reduction and 40.1x inference speedup, highlighting the feasibility of privacy-preserving on-device emotion recognition for real-world wearables.

Conclusion: 这项工作为ICL的涌现提供了必要和充分条件，并建立了Transformer在上下文学习中的基本计算极限。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to adapt to new tasks from demonstrations without parameter updates. Despite extensive empirical studies, a principled understanding of ICL emergence at scale remains more elusive. We present a unified theoretical framework connecting scaling laws to ICL emergence in transformers. Our analysis establishes that ICL performance follows power-law relationships with model depth $L$, width $d$, context length $k$, and training data $D$, with exponents determined by task structure. We show that under specific conditions, transformers implement gradient-based metalearning in their forward pass, with an effective learning rate $η_{\text{eff}} = Θ(1/\sqrt{Ld})$. We demonstrate sharp phase transitions at critical scales and derive optimal depth-width allocations favoring $L^* \propto N^{2/3}$, $d^* \propto N^{1/3}$ for the fixed parameter budget $N = Ld$. Systematic experiments on synthetic tasks validate our predictions, with measured scaling exponents closely matching theory. This work provides both necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of ICLs and establishes fundamental computational limits on what transformers can learn in-context.

Conclusion: MoSEs框架有效解决了持续学习中的关键挑战，实现了最小遗忘和次线性增长，为大语言模型的持续适应提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to a continuous stream of tasks is a critical yet challenging endeavor. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in continual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating distinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear growth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT method referred to as \textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel continual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient scalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the transformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This architecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated SubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, the router can adaptively select and combine previously learned sparse parameters for new tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer while ensuring that the model's capacity grows sublinearly. We evaluate MoSEs on the comprehensive TRACE benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that MoSEs significantly outperform conventional continual learning approaches in both knowledge retention and scalability to new tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with substantial memory and computational savings.

Abstract: This paper studies optimization proxies, machine learning (ML) models trained to efficiently predict optimal solutions for AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problems. While promising, optimization proxy performance heavily depends on training data quality. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel active sampling framework for ACOPF optimization proxies designed to generate realistic and diverse training data. The framework actively explores varied, flexible problem specifications reflecting plausible operational realities. More importantly, the approach uses optimization-specific quantities (active constraint sets) that better capture the salient features of an ACOPF that lead to the optimal solution. Numerical results show superior generalization over existing sampling methods with an equivalent training budget, significantly advancing the state-of-practice for trustworthy ACOPF optimization proxies.

Conclusion: IEC是提升高效扩散模型测试时性能的实用且可推广的解决方案，无需修改模型即可无缝集成到现有推理过程中。

Abstract: With the growing demand for high-quality image generation on resource-constrained devices, efficient diffusion models have received increasing attention. However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality. Once deployed, these errors are difficult to correct, as modifying the model is typically infeasible in deployment environments. Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that IEC consistently improves generation quality across various datasets, efficiency techniques, and model architectures, establishing it as a practical and generalizable solution for test-time enhancement of efficient diffusion models.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is a crucial approach to enhance the generalization capabilities and improve the sample efficiency of RL algorithms. However, current MBRL methods focus primarily on building world models for single tasks and rarely address generalization across different scenarios. Building on the insight that dynamics within the same simulation engine share inherent properties, we attempt to construct a unified world model capable of generalizing across different scenarios, named Meta-Regularized Contextual World-Model (MrCoM). This method first decomposes the latent state space into various components based on the dynamic characteristics, thereby enhancing the accuracy of world-model prediction. Further, MrCoM adopts meta-state regularization to extract unified representation of scenario-relevant information, and meta-value regularization to align world-model optimization with policy learning across diverse scenario objectives. We theoretically analyze the generalization error upper bound of MrCoM in multi-scenario settings. We systematically evaluate our algorithm's generalization ability across diverse scenarios, demonstrating significantly better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有质谱检索方法存在谱库覆盖有限和跨模态对齐不佳的问题，导致检索精度和泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：预检索阶段使用对比学习模型识别候选分子作为上下文先验；生成检索阶段整合候选分子和输入质谱，通过生成模型产生精炼分子结构用于重排序。

Conclusion: GLMR通过生成式方法有效缓解跨模态对齐问题，为质谱分子结构检索提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving molecular structures from tandem mass spectra is a crucial step in rapid compound identification. Existing retrieval methods, such as traditional mass spectral library matching, suffer from limited spectral library coverage, while recent cross-modal representation learning frameworks often encounter modality misalignment, resulting in suboptimal retrieval accuracy and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GLMR, a Generative Language Model-based Retrieval framework that mitigates the cross-modal misalignment through a two-stage process. In the pre-retrieval stage, a contrastive learning-based model identifies top candidate molecules as contextual priors for the input mass spectrum. In the generative retrieval stage, these candidate molecules are integrated with the input mass spectrum to guide a generative model in producing refined molecular structures, which are then used to re-rank the candidates based on molecular similarity. Experiments on both MassSpecGym and the proposed MassRET-20k dataset demonstrate that GLMR significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 40% improvement in top-1 accuracy and exhibiting strong generalizability.

Conclusion: CAMP-HiVe方法通过Hessian向量近似和动态权重合并，实现了高效的神经网络剪枝，在计算效率和模型性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Deep learning algorithms are becoming an essential component of many artificial intelligence (AI) driven applications, many of which run on resource-constrained and energy-constrained systems. For efficient deployment of these algorithms, although different techniques for the compression of neural network models are proposed, neural pruning is one of the fastest and effective methods, which can provide a high compression gain with minimal cost. To harness enhanced performance gain with respect to model complexity, we propose a novel neural network pruning approach utilizing Hessian-vector products that approximate crucial curvature information in the loss function, which significantly reduces the computation demands. By employing a power iteration method, our algorithm effectively identifies and preserves the essential information, ensuring a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency. Herein, we introduce CAMP-HiVe, a cyclic pair merging-based pruning with Hessian Vector approximation by iteratively consolidating weight pairs, combining significant and less significant weights, thus effectively streamlining the model while preserving its performance. This dynamic, adaptive framework allows for real-time adjustment of weight significance, ensuring that only the most critical parameters are retained. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant reductions in computational requirements while maintaining high performance across different neural network architectures, e.g., ResNet18, ResNet56, and MobileNetv2, on standard benchmark datasets, e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art neural pruning methods.

Abstract: Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is of great significance for drug discovery and drug repurposing. With the accumulation of a large volume of valuable data, data-driven methods have been increasingly harnessed to predict DTIs, reducing costs across various dimensions. Therefore, this paper proposes a $\textbf{L}$arge $\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{M}$odel and $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{M}$odel data co-powered $\textbf{D}$rug $\textbf{T}$arget $\textbf{I}$nteraction prediction framework, named LLM$^3$-DTI. LLM$^3$-DTI constructs multi-modal data embedding to enhance DTI prediction performance. In this framework, the text semantic embeddings of drugs and targets are encoded by a domain-specific LLM. To effectively align and fuse multi-modal embedding. We propose the dual cross-attention mechanism and the TSFusion module. Finally, these multi-modal data are utilized for the DTI task through an output network. The experimental results indicate that LLM$^3$-DTI can proficiently identify validated DTIs, surpassing the performance of the models employed for comparison across diverse scenarios. Consequently, LLM$^3$-DTI is adept at fulfilling the task of DTI prediction with excellence. The data and code are available at https://github.com/chaser-gua/LLM3DTI.

Conclusion: COTN能有效应对现实市场的不确定性和复杂性，为高波动系统在压力条件下的预测提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of financial and electricity markets, especially under extreme conditions, remains a significant challenge due to their intrinsic nonlinearity, rapid fluctuations, and chaotic patterns. To address these limitations, we propose the Chaotic Oscillatory Transformer Network (COTN). COTN innovatively combines a Transformer architecture with a novel Lee Oscillator activation function, processed through Max-over-Time pooling and a lambda-gating mechanism. This design is specifically tailored to effectively capture chaotic dynamics and improve responsiveness during periods of heightened volatility, where conventional activation functions (e.g., ReLU, GELU) tend to saturate. Furthermore, COTN incorporates an Autoencoder Self-Regressive (ASR) module to detect and isolate abnormal market patterns, such as sudden price spikes or crashes, thereby preventing corruption of the core prediction process and enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments across electricity spot markets and financial markets demonstrate the practical applicability and resilience of COTN. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models like Informer by up to 17% and traditional statistical methods like GARCH by as much as 40%. These results underscore COTN's effectiveness in navigating real-world market uncertainty and complexity, offering a powerful tool for forecasting highly volatile systems under duress.

Conclusion: 该方法能够在实现公平性的同时不损害任何人口群体的性能，适用于高风险领域。

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into human-centered domains such as healthcare, ensuring fairness while maintaining high predictive performance is critical. Existing bias mitigation techniques often impose a trade-off between fairness and accuracy, inadvertently degrading performance for certain demographic groups. In high-stakes domains like clinical diagnosis, such trade-offs are ethically and practically unacceptable. In this study, we propose a fairness-without-harm approach by learning distinct representations for different demographic groups and selectively applying demographic experts consisting of group-specific representations and personalized classifiers through a no-harm constrained selection. We evaluate our approach on three real-world medical datasets -- covering eye disease, skin cancer, and X-ray diagnosis -- as well as two face datasets. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving fairness without harm.

Conclusion: LinearNO通过重新设计注意力机制，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了效率，证明了线性注意力在PDE求解中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Transformer-based Neural Operators have enabled significant progress in data-driven solvers for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Most current research has focused on reducing the quadratic complexity of attention to address the resulting low training and inference efficiency. Among these works, Transolver stands out as a representative method that introduces Physics-Attention to reduce computational costs. Physics-Attention projects grid points into slices for slice attention, then maps them back through deslicing. However, we observe that Physics-Attention can be reformulated as a special case of linear attention, and that the slice attention may even hurt the model performance. Based on these observations, we argue that its effectiveness primarily arises from the slice and deslice operations rather than interactions between slices. Building on this insight, we propose a two-step transformation to redesign Physics-Attention into a canonical linear attention, which we call Linear Attention Neural Operator (LinearNO). Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on six standard PDE benchmarks, while reducing the number of parameters by an average of 40.0% and computational cost by 36.2%. Additionally, it delivers superior performance on two challenging, industrial-level datasets: AirfRANS and Shape-Net Car.

Abstract: Urban environments are continuously mapped and modeled by various data collection platforms, including satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles and street cameras. The growing availability of 3D geospatial data from multiple modalities has introduced new opportunities and challenges for integrating spatial knowledge at scale, particularly in high-impact domains such as urban planning and rapid disaster management. Geospatial entity resolution is the task of identifying matching spatial objects across different datasets, often collected independently under varying conditions. Existing approaches typically rely on spatial proximity, textual metadata, or external identifiers to determine correspondence. While useful, these signals are often unavailable, unreliable, or misaligned, especially in cross-source scenarios. To address these limitations, we shift the focus to the intrinsic geometry of 3D spatial objects and present 3dSAGER (3D Spatial-Aware Geospatial Entity Resolution), an end-to-end pipeline for geospatial entity resolution over 3D objects. 3dSAGER introduces a novel, spatial-reference-independent featurization mechanism that captures intricate geometric characteristics of matching pairs, enabling robust comparison even across datasets with incompatible coordinate systems where traditional spatial methods fail. As a key component of 3dSAGER, we also propose a new lightweight and interpretable blocking method, BKAFI, that leverages a trained model to efficiently generate high-recall candidate sets. We validate 3dSAGER through extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, demonstrating significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency over strong baselines. Our empirical study further dissects the contributions of each component, providing insights into their impact and the overall design choices.

Motivation: 当前推理优先模型的发展主要集中在数学领域，而竞争性编程代码生成领域研究不足，数据构建受到的关注少于RL算法设计。

Method: 采用监督微调(SFT)蒸馏自强开源模型，然后进行两阶段RL训练：第一阶段使用GRPO在大规模均匀分布问题上训练以扩展熵；第二阶段在高质量挑战性问题集上进行Pre-GRPO训练，采用硬焦点课程设计。

Result: 在LeetCode和Codeforces周赛上评估，实现了同类规模模型中的最先进性能，与DeepSeek v3.1和Doubao-1.5-Thinking等领先系统相当。

Conclusion: 研究提炼了竞争性编程代码生成中数据构建、熵扩展和课程设计的简洁最佳实践，并观察到在大规模MoE模型上具有强大的RL扩展性。

Abstract: Recent reasoning-first models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1) have spurred a resurgence of interest in RLVR. Nevertheless, advances are dominated by mathematics (e.g., AIME), with competitive-programming code generation underexplored and data curation receiving less attention than RL algorithm design. We investigate how to construct RLVR datasets (i.e., RL prompts) and present practical training techniques that yield strong performance on competitive-programming code generation. Our pipeline begins with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) distilled from strong open-source models, augmented with general-purpose and reasoning-intensive data. RL then follows a two-stage process with executable, testcase-driven rewards: first, training on a large, uniformly distributed set of competitive-programming problems using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with 8 rollouts per prompt and a relatively short response-generation window (e.g., 32k during SFT and 24k in this stage) to expand entropy and mitigate repetition and truncation; second, we perform \textbf{Pre-GRPO}: updating on a small, high-quality set of challenging problems with a large rollout budget (64 rollouts per prompt) under a hard-focus curriculum that continuously retains the most difficult instances throughout training. We implement our method on Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate on LeetCode and Codeforces weekly contests to avoid data leakage. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar scale and is comparable to leading systems such as DeepSeek v3.1 and Doubao-1.5-Thinking. We also examine scaling trends and observe strong RL scaling on an internal large-scale MoE model. Our study distills concise best practices for data curation, entropy expansion, and curriculum design in RLVR for competitive-programming code generation.

Result: 该方法适用于任意控制仿射系统和广泛非线性激活函数，在数值实验中比现有CBF验证方法能扩展到更大的神经网络。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过消除计算昂贵的验证过程，成功解决了神经网络CBFs的验证瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a popular tool for safety certification of nonlinear dynamical control systems. Recently, CBFs represented as neural networks have shown great promise due to their expressiveness and applicability to a broad class of dynamics and safety constraints. However, verifying that a trained neural network is indeed a valid CBF is a computational bottleneck that limits the size of the networks that can be used. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework for verifying neural CBFs based on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds on the conditions required for a neural network to be a CBF. Our approach is rooted in linear bound propagation (LBP) for neural networks, which we extend to compute bounds on the gradients of the network. Combined with McCormick relaxation, we derive linear upper and lower bounds on the CBF conditions, thereby eliminating the need for computationally expensive verification procedures. Our approach applies to arbitrary control-affine systems and a broad range of nonlinear activation functions. To reduce conservatism, we develop a parallelizable refinement strategy that adaptively refines the regions over which these bounds are computed. Our approach scales to larger neural networks than state-of-the-art verification procedures for CBFs, as demonstrated by our numerical experiments.

Method: 1. 对称差异shingle编码：计算分子shingle差异以捕捉反应特异性结构变化，同时消除顺序敏感性；2. 几何结构交互注意力：在shingle级别建模分子内和分子间交互。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提高了反应预测性能，在排列扰动下R²平均提升8.76%，表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ReaDISH通过创新的编码和注意力机制，有效解决了化学反应预测中的关键挑战，实现了更一致和泛化的预测性能。

Abstract: Chemical reaction prediction remains a fundamental challenge in organic chemistry, where existing machine learning models face two critical limitations: sensitivity to input permutations (molecule/atom orderings) and inadequate modeling of substructural interactions governing reactivity. These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features. It introduces two innovations: (1) symmetric difference shingle encoding, which computes molecular shingle differences to capture reaction-specific structural changes while eliminating order sensitivity; and (2) geometry-structure interaction attention, a mechanism that models intra- and inter-molecular interactions at the shingle level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaDISH improves reaction prediction performance across diverse benchmarks. It shows enhanced robustness with an average improvement of 8.76% on R$^2$ under permutation perturbations.

Abstract: The optimization of urban traffic is threatened by the complexity of achieving a balance between transport efficiency and the maintenance of privacy, as well as the equitable distribution of traffic based on socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($ε$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer在词汇表上下文学习场景下的通用逼近能力，特别关注位置编码对逼近性质的影响。

Method: 分析单层Transformer在有无位置编码情况下的函数逼近能力，提供位置编码满足UAP的充分条件。

Result: 无位置编码的单层Transformer在VICL场景下不具备UAP，但加入适当的位置编码后可以具备UAP。

Conclusion: 位置编码在上下文学习中具有重要的逼近理论意义，能够增强模型的函数逼近能力。

Abstract: Numerous studies have demonstrated that the Transformer architecture possesses the capability for in-context learning (ICL). In scenarios involving function approximation, context can serve as a control parameter for the model, endowing it with the universal approximation property (UAP). In practice, context is represented by tokens from a finite set, referred to as a vocabulary, which is the case considered in this paper, \emph{i.e.}, vocabulary in-context learning (VICL). We demonstrate that VICL in single-layer Transformers, without positional encoding, does not possess the UAP; however, it is possible to achieve the UAP when positional encoding is included. Several sufficient conditions for the positional encoding are provided. Our findings reveal the benefits of positional encoding from an approximation theory perspective in the context of ICL.

TL;DR: 提出了上下文引导的测试时强化学习(CG-TTRL)，通过在TTRL的两个采样阶段动态集成上下文信息，提高伪标签准确性并调节探索过程，在数学和科学QA基准上表现优于TTRL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TTRL的两阶段采样策略未充分利用上下文指导，而上下文学习在推理时已被证明能提升模型性能。上下文指导可以改善初始开发阶段的伪标签准确性，并在第二阶段调节探索过程。

Method: 将上下文动态集成到两个采样阶段，并提出高效上下文选择方法以适应设备端应用。

Result: 在数学和科学QA基准上，CG-TTRL优于TTRL（相对准确率提升7%），并在仅几步测试时训练后获得强劲性能（3步后相对TTRL提升8%）。

Conclusion: CG-TTRL通过上下文引导有效提升了TTRL的性能和效率，证明了上下文信息在测试时强化学习中的重要性。

Abstract: Test-time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) has shown promise in adapting foundation models for complex tasks at test-time, resulting in large performance improvements. TTRL leverages an elegant two-phase sampling strategy: first, multi-sampling derives a pseudo-label via majority voting, while subsequent downsampling and reward-based fine-tuning encourages the model to explore and learn diverse valid solutions, with the pseudo-label modulating the reward signal. Meanwhile, in-context learning has been widely explored at inference time and demonstrated the ability to enhance model performance without weight updates. However, TTRL's two-phase sampling strategy under-utilizes contextual guidance, which can potentially improve pseudo-label accuracy in the initial exploitation phase while regulating exploration in the second. To address this, we propose context-guided TTRL (CG-TTRL), integrating context dynamically into both sampling phases and propose a method for efficient context selection for on-device applications. Our evaluations on mathematical and scientific QA benchmarks show CG-TTRL outperforms TTRL (e.g. additional 7% relative accuracy improvement over TTRL), while boosting efficiency by obtaining strong performance after only a few steps of test-time training (e.g. 8% relative improvement rather than 1% over TTRL after 3 steps).

*Zinuo You,Jin Zheng,John Cartlidge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出C3E框架，通过信息论方法优化图神经网络中的隐藏维度和传播深度选择，解决过压缩问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络通常依赖启发式选择隐藏维度和传播深度，导致传播过程中的严重信息损失（过压缩问题）。

Method: 将隐藏维度和深度选择建模为基于信息论的非线性规划问题，将谱图神经网络建模为通信信道，连接信道容量与隐藏维度、传播深度、传播机制和图结构。

Result: 在9个公共数据集上的实验表明，C3E估计的隐藏维度和深度能缓解过压缩并持续改进表示学习。发现过压缩源于表示矩阵中信息的累积压缩。

Conclusion: 增加隐藏维度确实能缓解信息压缩，而传播深度的作用更为微妙，揭示了信息压缩与表示复杂性之间的基本平衡。

Abstract: Existing graph neural networks typically rely on heuristic choices for hidden dimensions and propagation depths, which often lead to severe information loss during propagation, known as over-squashing. To address this issue, we propose Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation (C3E), a novel framework that formulates the selection of hidden dimensions and depth as a nonlinear programming problem grounded in information theory. Through modeling spectral graph neural networks as communication channels, our approach directly connects channel capacity to hidden dimensions, propagation depth, propagation mechanism, and graph structure. Extensive experiments on nine public datasets demonstrate that hidden dimensions and depths estimated by C3E can mitigate over-squashing and consistently improve representation learning. Experimental results show that over-squashing occurs due to the cumulative compression of information in representation matrices. Furthermore, our findings show that increasing hidden dimensions indeed mitigate information compression, while the role of propagation depth is more nuanced, uncovering a fundamental balance between information compression and representation complexity.

Result: 在AIME25上提升23%，USPTO50k上提升10%，ProteinGym上提升14%，并发现经验增长的缩放规律和跨智能体经验继承现象。

Conclusion: FLEX标志着向可扩展和可继承的持续智能体进化迈出了一步。

Abstract: Autonomous agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized reasoning and problem-solving but remain static after training, unable to grow with experience as intelligent beings do during deployment. We introduce Forward Learning with EXperience (FLEX), a gradient-free learning paradigm that enables LLM agents to continuously evolve through accumulated experience. Specifically, FLEX cultivates scalable and inheritable evolution by constructing a structured experience library through continual reflection on successes and failures during interaction with the environment. FLEX delivers substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning, chemical retrosynthesis, and protein fitness prediction (up to 23% on AIME25, 10% on USPTO50k, and 14% on ProteinGym). We further identify a clear scaling law of experiential growth and the phenomenon of experience inheritance across agents, marking a step toward scalable and inheritable continuous agent evolution.

TL;DR: ARBITER是一个风险中性的神经算子，用于在无套利约束下学习SPX-VIX联合期限结构。它通过约束解码器和外梯度更新来确保静态套利约束，并在历史数据上优于现有方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的衍生品期限结构模型难以同时满足多种无套利约束（日历套利、垂直套利、蝶式套利），且缺乏对SPX和VIX联合建模的有效方法。

Method: 结合算子学习与约束解码器，使用外梯度风格更新加投影训练，强制实施Lipschitz边界和单调性约束，并通过选择性状态更新改善长期泛化能力。

Result: 在历史SPX和VIX数据上优于傅里叶神经算子、DeepONet和状态空间序列模型，消融研究表明绑定SPX-VIX腿能减少对偶间隙并改善可识别性。

Conclusion: ARBITER提供了一个实用的无套利插值和推断框架，能够在整个期限和行权价范围内保持无套利性质，同时改善了校准稳定性和长期泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose ARBITER, a risk-neutral neural operator for learning joint SPX-VIX term structures under no-arbitrage constraints. ARBITER maps market states to an operator that outputs implied volatility and variance curves while enforcing static arbitrage (calendar, vertical, butterfly), Lipschitz bounds, and monotonicity. The model couples operator learning with constrained decoders and is trained with extragradient-style updates plus projection. We introduce evaluation metrics for derivatives term structures (NAS, CNAS, NI, Dual-Gap, Stability Rate) and show gains over Fourier Neural Operator, DeepONet, and state-space sequence models on historical SPX and VIX data. Ablation studies indicate that tying the SPX and VIX legs reduces Dual-Gap and improves NI, Lipschitz projection stabilizes calibration, and selective state updates improve long-horizon generalization. We provide identifiability and approximation results and describe practical recipes for arbitrage-free interpolation and extrapolation across maturities and strikes.

Abstract: Although multimodal fusion has made significant progress, its advancement is severely hindered by the lack of adequate evaluation benchmarks. Current fusion methods are typically evaluated on a small selection of public datasets, a limited scope that inadequately represents the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios, potentially leading to biased evaluations. This issue presents a twofold challenge. On one hand, models may overfit to the biases of specific datasets, hindering their generalization to broader practical applications. On the other hand, the absence of a unified evaluation standard makes fair and objective comparisons between different fusion methods difficult. Consequently, a truly universal and high-performance fusion model has yet to emerge. To address these challenges, we have developed a large-scale, domain-adaptive benchmark for multimodal evaluation. This benchmark integrates over 30 datasets, encompassing 15 modalities and 20 predictive tasks across key application domains. To complement this, we have also developed an open-source, unified, and automated evaluation pipeline that includes standardized implementations of state-of-the-art models and diverse fusion paradigms. Leveraging this platform, we have conducted large-scale experiments, successfully establishing new performance baselines across multiple tasks. This work provides the academic community with a crucial platform for rigorous and reproducible assessment of multimodal models, aiming to propel the field of multimodal artificial intelligence to new heights.

Conclusion: 在紧致度量空间中，最优重构误差可以通过切比雪夫半径精确表征，并且可以区分不同空间类型中重构行为的渐近特性。

Abstract: Consider the task of locating an unknown target point using approximate distance queries: in each round, a reconstructor selects a query point and receives a noisy version of its distance to the target. This problem arises naturally in various contexts ranging from localization in GPS and sensor networks to privacy-aware data access, and spans a wide variety of metric spaces. It is relevant from the perspective of both the reconstructor (seeking accurate recovery) and the responder (aiming to limit information disclosure, e.g., for privacy or security reasons). We study this reconstruction game through a learning-theoretic lens, focusing on the rate and limits of the best possible reconstruction error. Our first result provides a tight geometric characterization of the optimal error in terms of the Chebyshev radius, a classical concept from geometry. This characterization applies to all compact metric spaces (in fact, even to all totally bounded spaces) and yields explicit formulas for natural metric spaces. Our second result addresses the asymptotic behavior of reconstruction, distinguishing between pseudo-finite spaces -- where the optimal error is attained after finitely many queries -- and spaces where the approximation curve exhibits nontrivial decay. We characterize pseudo-finiteness for convex Euclidean spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据估值方法无法在单次训练过程中确保有效性，NDDV方法解决了这一限制，但需要进一步的理论分析来确保其稳定性和收敛性。

Method: 基于NDDV方法，在Lipschitz和平滑性假设下进行理论分析，推导损失差异的二次误差界，分析梯度范数和元损失的收敛行为。

Result: 获得了损失差异的二次误差界（与时间步成反比，与控制变化成二次关系），证明了训练损失的期望平方梯度范数渐近消失，元损失次线性收敛。

Conclusion: NDDV方法在理论上具有稳定性保证和次线性收敛特性，为数据估值提供了可靠的理论基础。

Abstract: Data valuation quantifies data importance, but existing methods cannot ensure validity in a single training process. The neural dynamic data valuation (NDDV) method [3] addresses this limitation. Based on NDDV, we are the first to explore error estimation and convergence analysis in data valuation. Under Lipschitz and smoothness assumptions, we derive quadratic error bounds for loss differences that scale inversely with time steps and quadratically with control variations, ensuring stability. We also prove that the expected squared gradient norm for the training loss vanishes asymptotically, and that the meta loss converges sublinearly over iterations. In particular, NDDV achieves sublinear convergence.

Result: DyKAF持续提高了Fisher矩阵近似质量，在大型语言模型预训练和微调实验中，在各种评估指标上均优于现有优化器。

Conclusion: DyKAF方法通过投影-分裂积分器有效解决了Fisher矩阵结构化近似的挑战，为矩阵权重优化提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, optimizers that explicitly treat weights as matrices, rather than flattened vectors, have demonstrated their effectiveness. This perspective naturally leads to structured approximations of the Fisher matrix as preconditioners, where the matrix view induces a Kronecker-factorized form that enables memory-efficient representation. However, constructing such approximations both efficiently and accurately remains an open challenge, since obtaining the optimal factorization is resource-intensive and practical methods therefore rely on heuristic design choices. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages projector-splitting integrators to construct effective preconditioners. Our optimizer, DyKAF (Dynamical Kronecker Approximation of the Fisher Matrix), consistently improves the Fisher matrix approximation quality. Experiments on large language model pre-training and fine-tuning demonstrate that DyKAF outperforms existing optimizers across a range of evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: SeqTopK是一种序列级TopK路由方法，通过将专家预算从token级转移到序列级，实现端到端学习的动态专家分配，无需额外模块或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准TopK路由为所有token分配固定数量的专家，忽略了token复杂度的差异，而现有的自适应路由方法需要额外模块和重新训练。

Method: 通过选择序列中所有token的前T·K个专家，在保持总预算不变的情况下，让困难token获得更多专家，简单token获得更少专家。

Result: 在数学、编程、法律和写作等任务上相比TopK和现有参数无关方法都有提升，在高稀疏度下增益可达16.9%。

Conclusion: SeqTopK是一种简单、高效、可扩展的路由策略，特别适合下一代LLM的极端稀疏场景。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale large language models (LLMs) by activating only a subset of experts per token, but the standard TopK routing assigns the same fixed number of experts to all tokens, ignoring their varying complexity. Prior adaptive routing methods introduce additional modules and hyperparameters, often requiring costly retraining from scratch. We propose Sequence-level TopK (SeqTopK), a minimal modification that shifts the expert budget from the token level to the sequence level. By selecting the top $T \cdot K$ experts across all $T$ tokens, SeqTopK enables end-to-end learned dynamic allocation -- assigning more experts to difficult tokens and fewer to easy ones -- while preserving the same overall budget. SeqTopK requires only a few lines of code, adds less than 1% overhead, and remains fully compatible with pretrained MoE models. Experiments across math, coding, law, and writing show consistent improvements over TopK and prior parameter-free adaptive methods, with gains that become substantially larger under higher sparsity (up to 16.9%). These results highlight SeqTopK as a simple, efficient, and scalable routing strategy, particularly well-suited for the extreme sparsity regimes of next-generation LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Y-Research-SBU/SeqTopK.

Conclusion: TriShGAN通过三元组损失和Shapelet提取器的结合，为多变量时间序列生成更鲁棒和高效的反事实解释，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: In decision-making processes, stakeholders often rely on counterfactual explanations, which provide suggestions about what should be changed in the queried instance to alter the outcome of an AI system. However, generating these explanations for multivariate time series presents challenges due to their complex, multi-dimensional nature. Traditional Nearest Unlike Neighbor-based methods typically substitute subsequences in a queried time series with influential subsequences from an NUN, which is not always realistic in real-world scenarios due to the rigid direct substitution. Counterfactual with Residual Generative Adversarial Networks-based methods aim to address this by learning from the distribution of observed data to generate synthetic counterfactual explanations. However, these methods primarily focus on minimizing the cost from the queried time series to the counterfactual explanations and often neglect the importance of distancing the counterfactual explanation from the decision boundary. This oversight can result in explanations that no longer qualify as counterfactual if minor changes occur within the model. To generate a more robust counterfactual explanation, we introduce TriShGAN, under the CounteRGAN framework enhanced by the incorporation of triplet loss. This unsupervised learning approach uses distance metric learning to encourage the counterfactual explanations not only to remain close to the queried time series but also to capture the feature distribution of the instance with the desired outcome, thereby achieving a better balance between minimal cost and robustness. Additionally, we integrate a Shapelet Extractor that strategically selects the most discriminative parts of the high-dimensional queried time series to enhance the sparsity of counterfactual explanation and efficiency of the training process.

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性、校准性和系统效率方面达到平衡，为生产级电动汽车能量管理提供可靠的里程估计和决策支持。

Abstract: Accurate EV power estimation underpins range prediction and energy management, yet practitioners need both point accuracy and trustworthy uncertainty. We propose an anchored-ensemble Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a Student-t likelihood that jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Anchoring imposes a Gaussian weight prior (MAP training), yielding posterior-like diversity without test-time sampling, while the t-head provides heavy-tailed robustness and closed-form prediction intervals. Using vehicle-kinematic time series (e.g., speed, motor RPM), our model attains strong accuracy: RMSE 3.36 +/- 1.10, MAE 2.21 +/- 0.89, R-squared = 0.93 +/- 0.02, explained variance 0.93 +/- 0.02, and delivers well-calibrated uncertainty bands with near-nominal coverage. Against competitive baselines (Student-t MC dropout; quantile regression with/without anchoring), our method matches or improves log-scores while producing sharper intervals at the same coverage. Crucially for real-time deployment, inference is a single deterministic pass per ensemble member (or a weight-averaged collapse), eliminating Monte Carlo latency. The result is a compact, theoretically grounded estimator that couples accuracy, calibration, and systems efficiency, enabling reliable range estimation and decision-making for production EV energy management.

Motivation: 解决在RAN中部署AI模型时面临的三大挑战：链路测量数据有限、实时处理要求严格（<1ms/TTI）、网络异构性，特别是4G系统硬件缺乏神经网络加速器，只能部署轻量级模型（<1Mb，<100μs推理时间）。

Abstract: Adopting artificial intelligence (AI) in radio access networks (RANs) presents several challenges, including limited availability of link-level measurements (e.g., CQI reports), stringent real-time processing constraints (e.g., sub-1 ms per TTI), and network heterogeneity (different spectrum bands, cell types, and vendor equipment). A critical yet often overlooked barrier lies in the computational and memory limitations of RAN baseband hardware, particularly in legacy 4th Generation (4G) systems, which typically lack on-chip neural accelerators. As a result, only lightweight AI models (under 1 Mb and sub-100~μs inference time) can be effectively deployed, limiting both their performance and applicability. However, achieving strong generalization across diverse network conditions often requires large-scale models with substantial resource demands. To address this trade-off, this paper investigates policy distillation in the context of a reinforcement learning-based link adaptation task. We explore two strategies: single-policy distillation, where a scenario-agnostic teacher model is compressed into one generalized student model; and multi-policy distillation, where multiple scenario-specific teachers are consolidated into a single generalist student. Experimental evaluations in a high-fidelity, 5th Generation (5G)-compliant simulator demonstrate that both strategies produce compact student models that preserve the teachers' generalization capabilities while complying with the computational and memory limitations of existing RAN hardware.

Abstract: In this work, we study offline convex optimization with smooth objectives, where the classical Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) method achieves the optimal accelerated convergence. Extensive research has aimed to understand NAG from various perspectives, and a recent line of work approaches this from the viewpoint of online learning and online-to-batch conversion, emphasizing the role of optimistic online algorithms for acceleration. In this work, we contribute to this perspective by proposing novel optimistic online-to-batch conversions that incorporate optimism theoretically into the analysis, thereby significantly simplifying the online algorithm design while preserving the optimal convergence rates. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our conversions through the following results: (i) when combined with simple online gradient descent, our optimistic conversion achieves the optimal accelerated convergence; (ii) our conversion also applies to strongly convex objectives, and by leveraging both optimistic online-to-batch conversion and optimistic online algorithms, we achieve the optimal accelerated convergence rate for strongly convex and smooth objectives, for the first time through the lens of online-to-batch conversion; (iii) our optimistic conversion can achieve universality to smoothness -- applicable to both smooth and non-smooth objectives without requiring knowledge of the smoothness coefficient -- and remains efficient as non-universal methods by using only one gradient query in each iteration. Finally, we highlight the effectiveness of our optimistic online-to-batch conversions by a precise correspondence with NAG.

Abstract: Message passing is the core operation in graph neural networks, where each node updates its embeddings by aggregating information from its neighbors. However, in deep architectures, this process often leads to diminished expressiveness. A popular solution is to use residual connections, where the input from the current (or initial) layer is added to aggregated neighbor information to preserve embeddings across layers. Following a recent line of research, we investigate an adaptive residual scheme in which different nodes have varying residual strengths. We prove that this approach prevents oversmoothing; particularly, we show that the Dirichlet energy of the embeddings remains bounded away from zero. This is the first theoretical guarantee not only for the adaptive setting, but also for static residual connections (where residual strengths are shared across nodes) with activation functions. Furthermore, extensive experiments show that this adaptive approach outperforms standard and state-of-the-art message passing mechanisms, especially on heterophilic graphs. To improve the time complexity of our approach, we introduce a variant in which residual strengths are not learned but instead set heuristically, a choice that performs as well as the learnable version.

Abstract: Lost circulation remains a major and costly challenge in drilling operations, often resulting in wellbore instability, stuck pipe, and extended non-productive time. Accurate prediction of fluid loss is therefore essential for improving drilling safety and efficiency. This study presents a probabilistic machine learning framework based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for predicting drilling fluid loss in complex formations. The GPR model captures nonlinear dependencies among drilling parameters while quantifying predictive uncertainty, offering enhanced reliability for high-risk decision-making. Model hyperparameters are optimized using the Limited memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno (LBFGS) algorithm to ensure numerical stability and robust generalization. To improve interpretability, Local Interpretable Model agnostic Explanations (LIME) are employed to elucidate how individual features influence model predictions. The results highlight the potential of explainable probabilistic learning for proactive identification of lost-circulation risks, optimized design of lost circulation materials (LCM), and reduction of operational uncertainties in drilling applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in addressing node classification tasks. However, the effectiveness of traditional GNNs degrades on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different labels or properties. While recent work has introduced mechanisms to improve GNN performance under heterophily, certain key limitations still exist. Most existing models apply a fixed aggregation depth across all nodes, overlooking the fact that nodes may require different propagation depths based on their local homophily levels and neighborhood structures. Moreover, many methods are tailored to either homophilic or heterophilic settings, lacking the flexibility to generalize across both regimes. To address these challenges, we develop a theoretical framework that links local structural and label characteristics to information propagation dynamics at the node level. Our analysis shows that optimal aggregation depth varies across nodes and is critical for preserving class-discriminative information. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive-depth GNN architecture that dynamically selects node-specific aggregation depths using theoretically grounded metrics. Our method seamlessly adapts to both homophilic and heterophilic patterns within a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the performance of standard GNN backbones across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems from observational data is essential for several applications across science and engineering. A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning. Through numerical demonstrations, we illustrate that our proposed training strategy, which we coined as the Weak-Penalty NODE (WP-NODE), achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and exceptional robustness across benchmark chaotic dynamical systems.

TL;DR: EnFo框架通过生成具有不对称效用的竞争性合成数据，解决数据共享与竞争优势保护的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据的非竞争性使企业在共享数据时面临困境：共享能释放价值但会削弱竞争优势。现有数据合成方法往往产生对称效用的数据，无法保护数据所有者的利益。

Method: EnFo框架分两阶段：首先将原始数据的预测知识封装到指定的"密钥"模型中，然后通过优化合成数据使其故意过拟合该密钥模型。

Result: EnFo表现出显著的样本效率，仅用原始数据的一小部分就能匹配其性能，同时提供强大的隐私保护和抗滥用能力。

Conclusion: EnFo为企业提供了在不损害核心分析优势的情况下进行战略合作的实用解决方案，将非竞争性数据转化为竞争性产品。

Abstract: The non-rival nature of data creates a dilemma for firms: sharing data unlocks value but risks eroding competitive advantage. Existing data synthesis methods often exacerbate this problem by creating data with symmetric utility, allowing any party to extract its value. This paper introduces the Encapsulation-Forging (EnFo) framework, a novel approach to generate rival synthetic data with asymmetric utility. EnFo operates in two stages: it first encapsulates predictive knowledge from the original data into a designated ``key'' model, and then forges a synthetic dataset by optimizing the data to intentionally overfit this key model. This process transforms non-rival data into a rival product, ensuring its value is accessible only to the intended model, thereby preventing unauthorized use and preserving the data owner's competitive edge. Our framework demonstrates remarkable sample efficiency, matching the original data's performance with a fraction of its size, while providing robust privacy protection and resistance to misuse. EnFo offers a practical solution for firms to collaborate strategically without compromising their core analytical advantage.

Conclusion: DST框架通过空间和时间自监督学习的有效结合，成功解决了道路网络表示学习中的关键挑战，在多种任务中展现出卓越性能

Abstract: Road network representation learning (RNRL) has attracted increasing attention from both researchers and practitioners as various spatiotemporal tasks are emerging. Recent advanced methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to characterize the spatial structure of road segments in a self-supervised paradigm. However, spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of road networks raise severe challenges to the neighborhood smoothing mechanism of self-supervised GNNs. To address these issues, we propose a $\textbf{D}$ual-branch $\textbf{S}$patial-$\textbf{T}$emporal self-supervised representation framework for enhanced road representations, termed as DST. On one hand, DST designs a mix-hop transition matrix for graph convolution to incorporate dynamic relations of roads from trajectories. Besides, DST contrasts road representations of the vanilla road network against that of the hypergraph in a spatial self-supervised way. The hypergraph is newly built based on three types of hyperedges to capture long-range relations. On the other hand, DST performs next token prediction as the temporal self-supervised task on the sequences of traffic dynamics based on a causal Transformer, which is further regularized by differentiating traffic modes of weekdays from those of weekends. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods verify the superiority of our proposed framework. Moreover, the comprehensive spatiotemporal modeling facilitates DST to excel in zero-shot learning scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨建筑HVAC能耗预测面临数据稀缺和异质性挑战，现有方法容易过拟合伪相关、依赖专家干预或牺牲数据多样性。

Method: 结合全局特征门控（自监督伯努利正则化）和领域平衡训练方案，自动识别因果特征并最小化跨域损失方差。

Result: 在三个气候各异城市的真实数据集上，CaberNet始终优于所有基线方法，NMSE比最佳基准降低22.9%。

Conclusion: CaberNet提供了一种纯数据驱动的解决方案，能够稳健地进行跨域HVAC能耗预测，无需专家知识或大量标注数据。

Abstract: Cross-domain HVAC energy prediction is essential for scalable building energy management, particularly because collecting extensive labeled data for every new building is both costly and impractical. Yet, this task remains highly challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction. In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge, CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions, minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence. We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving a 22.9\% reduction in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to the best benchmark.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个机器学习框架，用于预测哪些饮料客户在获得冷柜后最有可能实现销量增长，以优化FMCG行业的资产分配决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速消费品行业中，冷柜等物理资产的放置位置直接影响收入增长和执行效率。虽然B2B环境中的客户流失预测和需求预测已被广泛研究，但使用机器学习指导资产分配仍相对未被探索。

Method: 使用来自中美洲知名酿酒和饮料公司的3,119个B2B传统贸易渠道客户数据集，跟踪冷柜安装前后12个月的销售交易。定义了10%、30%和50%三个销量增长阈值，比较了XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost等机器学习模型，并结合SHAP进行可解释的特征分析。

Result: 最佳模型在验证集上的AUC得分分别为0.857、0.877和0.898，模拟表明该方法相比传统的基于销量的方法可以改善ROI，更好地选择有增长潜力的客户，并通过不分配给不会增长的客户来增加成本节约。

Conclusion: 该框架为FMCG行业提供了有效的资产分配决策支持，能够显著改善业务运营效率和投资回报率。

Abstract: In the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry, deciding where to place physical assets, such as commercial beverage coolers, can directly impact revenue growth and execution efficiency. Although churn prediction and demand forecasting have been widely studied in B2B contexts, the use of machine learning to guide asset allocation remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a framework focused on predicting which beverage clients are most likely to deliver strong returns in volume after receiving a cooler. Using a private dataset from a well-known Central American brewing and beverage company of 3,119 B2B traditional trade channel clients that received a cooler from 2022-01 to 2024-07, and tracking 12 months of sales transactions before and after cooler installation, three growth thresholds were defined: 10%, 30% and 50% growth in sales volume year over year. The analysis compares results of machine learning models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost combined with SHAP for interpretable feature analysis in order to have insights into improving business operations related to cooler allocation; the results show that the best model has AUC scores of 0.857, 0.877, and 0.898 across the thresholds on the validation set. Simulations suggest that this approach can improve ROI because it better selects potential clients to grow at the expected level and increases cost savings by not assigning clients that will not grow, compared to traditional volume-based approaches with substantial business management recommendations

Motivation: 现有药物相互作用预测模型要么依赖知识图谱（无法处理未知药物），要么依赖电子健康记录（噪声大、时间依赖性强且站点依赖），需要开发能够结合两者优势并实现零样本推理的系统。

Conclusion: 该系统支持在临床决策支持和药物警戒中的实际应用，能够为未知药物生成机制特异性、临床一致的预测，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) remain a major source of preventable harm, and many clinically important mechanisms are still unknown. Existing models either rely on pharmacologic knowledge graphs (KGs), which fail on unseen drugs, or on electronic health records (EHRs), which are noisy, temporal, and site-dependent. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first system that conditions KG relation scoring on patient-level EHR context and distills that reasoning into an EHR-only model for zero-shot inference. A fusion "Teacher" learns mechanism-specific relations for drug pairs represented in both sources, while a distilled "Student" generalizes to new or rarely used drugs without KG access at inference. Both operate under a shared ontology (set) of pharmacologic mechanisms (drug relations) to produce interpretable, auditable alerts rather than opaque risk scores. Trained on a multi-institution EHR corpus paired with a curated DrugBank DDI graph, and evaluated using a clinically aligned, decision-focused protocol with leakage-safe negatives that avoid artificially easy pairs, the system maintains precision across multi-institutuion test data, produces mechanism-specific, clinically consistent predictions, reduces false alerts (higher precision) at comparable overall detection performance (F1), and misses fewer true interactions compared to prior methods. Case studies further show zero-shot identification of clinically recognized CYP-mediated and pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drugs absent from the KG, supporting real-world use in clinical decision support and pharmacovigilance.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可解释、数据驱动的方法来优化AD诊断路径，在准确性和成本之间取得平衡，使早期可靠预测在现实实践中更易实现。

Abstract: Accurate predictions of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) can enable effective personalized therapy. While cognitive tests and clinical data are routinely collected, they lack the predictive power of PET scans and CSF biomarker analysis, which are prohibitively expensive to obtain for every patient. To address this cost-accuracy dilemma, we design a two-stage machine learning framework that selectively obtains advanced, costly features based on their predicted "value of information". We apply our framework to predict AD progression for MCI patients using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework reduces the need for advanced testing by 20% while achieving a test AUROC of 0.929, comparable to the model that uses both basic and advanced features (AUROC=0.915, p=0.1010). We also provide an example interpretability analysis showing how one may explain the triage decision. Our work presents an interpretable, data-driven framework that optimizes AD diagnostic pathways and balances accuracy with cost, representing a step towards making early, reliable AD prediction more accessible in real-world practice. Future work should consider multiple categories of advanced features and larger-scale validation.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning (MML) aims to integrate information from multiple modalities, which is expected to lead to superior performance over single-modality learning. However, recent studies have shown that MML can underperform, even compared to single-modality approaches, due to imbalanced learning across modalities. Methods have been proposed to alleviate this imbalance issue using different heuristics, which often lead to computationally intensive subroutines. In this paper, we reformulate the MML problem as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem that overcomes the imbalanced learning issue among modalities and propose a gradient-based algorithm to solve the modified MML problem. We provide convergence guarantees for the proposed method, and empirical evaluations on popular MML benchmarks showcasing the improved performance of the proposed method over existing balanced MML and MOO baselines, with up to ~20x reduction in subroutine computation time.

Conclusion: 通过逐层剥离上下文与因果关系，CLaP产生了既准确又可解释的分子设计预测器，案例研究证实了显著性图谱的准确性及其与化学直觉的一致性。

Abstract: Deep models are used for molecular property prediction, yet they are often difficult to interpret and may rely on spurious context rather than causal structure, which reduces reliability under distribution shift and harms predictive performance. We introduce CLaP (Causal Layerwise Peeling), a framework that separates causal signal from context in a layerwise manner and integrates diverse graph representations of molecules. At each layer, a causal block performs a soft split into causal and non-causal branches, fuses causal evidence across modalities, and progressively removes batch-coupled context to focus on label-relevant structure, thereby limiting shortcut signals and stabilizing layerwise refinement. Across four molecular benchmarks, CLaP consistently improves MAE, MSE, and $R^2$ over competitive baselines. The model also produces atom-level causal saliency maps that highlight substructures responsible for predictions, providing actionable guidance for targeted molecular edits. Case studies confirm the accuracy of these maps and their alignment with chemical intuition. By peeling context from cause at every layer, the model yields predictors that are both accurate and interpretable for molecular design.

Conclusion: ML-EcoLyzer为可持续性意识模型选择设定了标准，并提供了推理期间环境成本的广泛实证评估。

Abstract: Machine learning inference occurs at a massive scale, yet its environmental impact remains poorly quantified, especially on low-resource hardware. We present ML-EcoLyzer, a cross-framework tool for measuring the carbon, energy, thermal, and water costs of inference across CPUs, consumer GPUs, and datacenter accelerators. The tool supports both classical and modern models, applying adaptive monitoring and hardware-aware evaluation.
  We introduce the Environmental Sustainability Score (ESS), which quantifies the number of effective parameters served per gram of CO$_2$ emitted. Our evaluation covers over 1,900 inference configurations, spanning diverse model architectures, task modalities (text, vision, audio, tabular), hardware types, and precision levels. These rigorous and reliable measurements demonstrate that quantization enhances ESS, huge accelerators can be inefficient for lightweight applications, and even small models may incur significant costs when implemented suboptimally. ML-EcoLyzer sets a standard for sustainability-conscious model selection and offers an extensive empirical evaluation of environmental costs during inference.

TL;DR: MMEA是一种新的等变参数高效微调方法，通过轻量级标量门控在每阶和每多重性基础上调制特征幅度，保持严格等变性，在多个基准测试中达到最先进的能量和力预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的等变图神经网络虽然高效准确，但适应新任务时仍需微调。传统参数高效微调方法会破坏对称性，而ELoRA虽然等变但自由度较高，可能扰动预训练特征分布。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MMEA持续改进能量和力预测至最先进水平，同时训练参数少于竞争方法。

Conclusion: 在许多实际场景中，调制通道幅度足以使等变模型适应新化学环境而不破坏对称性，这为等变PEFT设计指明了新方向。

Abstract: Pretrained equivariant graph neural networks based on spherical harmonics offer efficient and accurate alternatives to computationally expensive ab-initio methods, yet adapting them to new tasks and chemical environments still requires fine-tuning. Conventional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapters and LoRA, typically break symmetry, making them incompatible with those equivariant architectures. ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design.

TL;DR: SCARE是一个超压缩的传感器校准Transformer模型，通过三个核心组件同时满足八个微观需求，在保持高精度的同时实现实时性和资源效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有设备端传感器校准研究仅关注三个宏观需求（精度、实时性、资源效率），忽略了瞬时误差和最坏情况延迟等部署瓶颈。

Method: 1) 序列透镜投影器对数压缩时间序列数据；2) 高效位注意力模块用位运算替代乘法；3) 哈希优化策略确保稳定训练。

Result: 在大规模空气质量数据集和真实微控制器部署中，SCARE优于现有线性、混合和深度学习基线模型。

Conclusion: SCARE是首个同时满足所有八个微观需求的传感器校准模型，实现了精度、实时性和效率的平衡。

Abstract: Most on-device sensor calibration studies benchmark models only against three macroscopic requirements (i.e., accuracy, real-time, and resource efficiency), thereby hiding deployment bottlenecks such as instantaneous error and worst-case latency. We therefore decompose this triad into eight microscopic requirements and introduce Scare (Sensor Calibration model balancing Accuracy, Real-time, and Efficiency), an ultra-compressed transformer that fulfills them all. SCARE comprises three core components: (1) Sequence Lens Projector (SLP) that logarithmically compresses time-series data while preserving boundary information across bins, (2) Efficient Bitwise Attention (EBA) module that replaces costly multiplications with bitwise operations via binary hash codes, and (3) Hash optimization strategy that ensures stable training without auxiliary loss terms. Together, these components minimize computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy and compatibility with microcontroller units (MCUs). Extensive experiments on large-scale air-quality datasets and real microcontroller deployments demonstrate that Scare outperforms existing linear, hybrid, and deep-learning baselines, making Scare, to the best of our knowledge, the first model to meet all eight microscopic requirements simultaneously.

Abstract: Efficient on-device language models around 1 billion parameters are essential for powering low-latency AI applications on mobile and wearable devices. However, achieving strong performance in this model class, while supporting long context windows and practical deployment remains a significant challenge. We introduce MobileLLM-Pro, a 1-billion-parameter language model optimized for on-device deployment.

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for adapting models to new tasks while retaining previously acquired knowledge. While existing approaches predominantly focus on uni-modal data, multi-modal learning offers substantial benefits by utilizing diverse sensory inputs, akin to human perception. However, multi-modal continual learning presents additional challenges, as the model must effectively integrate new information from various modalities while preventing catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose a pre-trained model-based framework for multi-modal continual learning. Our framework includes a novel cross-modality adapter with a mixture-of-experts structure to facilitate effective integration of multi-modal information across tasks. We also introduce a representation alignment loss that fosters learning of robust multi-modal representations, and regularize relationships between learned representations to preserve knowledge from previous tasks. Experiments on several multi-modal datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both class-incremental and domain-incremental learning, achieving higher accuracy and reduced forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理模型广泛使用，但其性能提升机制尚不明确，需要深入理解推理模型背后的工作机制。

Method: 使用rank-1 LoRA为Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct创建最小参数适配器，并在整个激活状态上训练稀疏自编码器来识别细粒度特征。

Result: LoRA适配器能恢复73-90%的推理基准性能，其激活与MLP神经元一样可解释，且针对特定推理行为激活。

Conclusion: 推理性能主要来自基础模型参数的微小改变，参数高效训练方法可作为揭示语言模型行为动态的有力工具。

Abstract: Reasoning models leverage inference-time compute to significantly enhance the performance of language models on difficult logical tasks, and have become a dominating paradigm in frontier LLMs. Despite their wide adoption, the mechanisms underpinning the enhanced performance of these reasoning models are not well understood. In this work, we show that the majority of new capabilities in reasoning models can be elicited by small, single-rank changes to base model parameters, with many of these changes being interpretable. Specifically, we use a rank-1 LoRA to create a minimal parameter adapter for Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct which recovers 73-90% of reasoning-benchmark performance compared to a full parameter finetune. We find that the activations of this LoRA are as interpretable as MLP neurons, and fire for reasoning-specific behaviors. Finally, we train a sparse autoencoder on the entire activation state of this LoRA and identify fine-grained and monosemantic features. Our findings highlight that reasoning performance can arise largely from minimal changes to base model parameters, and explore what these changes affect. More broadly, our work shows that parameter-efficient training methods can be used as a targeted lens for uncovering fundamental insights about language model behavior and dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出DMbaGCN框架，通过集成Mamba到GNN中，从局部和全局角度解决深度图神经网络中的过平滑问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如残差连接和跳跃层）未能显式建模节点表示在层间的节点特定渐进演化，且未考虑全局信息，这些对于缓解过平滑问题至关重要。

Method: DMbaGCN包含两个模块：LSEMba用于局部邻域聚合，利用Mamba的选择性状态空间建模捕获跨层的节点特定表示动态；GCAMba利用Mamba的全局注意力能力为每个节点融入全局上下文。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: DMbaGCN通过结合局部状态演化和全局上下文感知，增强了深度GNN中节点的可区分性，从而有效缓解了过平滑问题。

Abstract: Over-smoothing remains a fundamental challenge in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where repeated message passing causes node representations to become indistinguishable. While existing solutions, such as residual connections and skip layers, alleviate this issue to some extent, they fail to explicitly model how node representations evolve in a node-specific and progressive manner across layers. Moreover, these methods do not take global information into account, which is also crucial for mitigating the over-smoothing problem. To address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a Dual Mamba-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (DMbaGCN), which is a novel framework that integrates Mamba into GNNs to address over-smoothing from both local and global perspectives. DMbaGCN consists of two modules: the Local State-Evolution Mamba (LSEMba) for local neighborhood aggregation and utilizing Mamba's selective state space modeling to capture node-specific representation dynamics across layers, and the Global Context-Aware Mamba (GCAMba) that leverages Mamba's global attention capabilities to incorporate global context for each node. By combining these components, DMbaGCN enhances node discriminability in deep GNNs, thereby mitigating over-smoothing. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个文本分类任务中表现出色，相比传统方法避免了传统微调方法的大量参数更新，同时减少了联邦学习中客户端级别的数据传输和本地计算。

Conclusion: IFed-ICL能够利用本地私有领域数据实现高效的分布式上下文学习，显著提升模型在特定任务上的性能。

Abstract: As large language models continue to develop and expand, the extensive public data they rely on faces the risk of depletion. Consequently, leveraging private data within organizations to enhance the performance of large models has emerged as a key challenge. The federated learning paradigm, combined with model fine-tuning techniques, effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters. However,the necessity to process high-dimensional feature spaces results in substantial overall computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose the Implicit Federated In-Context Learning (IFed-ICL) framework. IFed-ICL draws inspiration from federated learning to establish a novel distributed collaborative paradigm, by converting client local context examples into implicit vector representations, it enables distributed collaborative computation during the inference phase and injects model residual streams to enhance model performance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves outstanding performance across multiple text classification tasks. Compared to traditional methods, IFed-ICL avoids the extensive parameter updates required by conventional fine-tuning methods while reducing data transmission and local computation at the client level in federated learning. This enables efficient distributed context learning using local private-domain data, significantly improving model performance on specific tasks.

Motivation: Transformer模型在CV和NLP领域表现出色，但非线性操作导致推理延迟，给硬件加速带来挑战。需要一种能高效加速非线性操作的方法。

Method: 提出QUARK框架，利用非线性操作的共同模式实现电路共享，减少硬件资源需求。专门针对Transformer模型中的所有非线性操作进行高性能近似加速。

Result: 在主流Transformer架构中，QUARK显著降低非线性算子的计算开销，相比GPU实现端到端加速达1.96倍，非线性模块硬件开销降低50%以上，在超低位量化下还能大幅提升精度。

Conclusion: QUARK通过电路共享设计有效解决了Transformer模型中非线性操作的加速问题，在降低硬件开销的同时保持了高精度，为高效硬件加速提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have revolutionized computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) by achieving state-of-the-art performance across a range of benchmarks. However, nonlinear operations in models significantly contribute to inference latency, presenting unique challenges for efficient hardware acceleration. To this end, we propose QUARK, a quantization-enabled FPGA acceleration framework that leverages common patterns in nonlinear operations to enable efficient circuit sharing, thereby reducing hardware resource requirements. QUARK targets all nonlinear operations within Transformer-based models, achieving high-performance approximation through a novel circuit-sharing design tailored to accelerate these operations. Our evaluation demonstrates that QUARK significantly reduces the computational overhead of nonlinear operators in mainstream Transformer architectures, achieving up to a 1.96 times end-to-end speedup over GPU implementations. Moreover, QUARK lowers the hardware overhead of nonlinear modules by more than 50% compared to prior approaches, all while maintaining high model accuracy -- and even substantially boosting accuracy under ultra-low-bit quantization.

TL;DR: DTA是一个两阶段的数据整理框架，通过将解题过程（不仅是最终答案）作为首要监督信号，在电信数学领域实现SOTA性能，同时显著提升边缘计算效率。


<details>

Motivation: 通用大语言模型在电信等垂直领域部署时面临稀缺、低信息密度语料和移动/边缘设备资源限制的挑战，需要高效的领域适应方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用强教师模型合成多样化候选解；第二阶段重写教师解以对齐中间步骤和呈现风格，并通过一致性检查和反思式评判进行信号感知的示例选择。

Result: 在TELEMATH数据集上达到72.45% pass@1准确率，比蒸馏训练高17.65个百分点，比带思考模式的Qwen3-32B高2.94个百分点；边缘推理场景下能耗降低42%，延迟减少60%。

Conclusion: 对齐解题过程能够产生紧凑高效的高质量监督信号，为低资源垂直领域的领域适应提供了实用方案。

Abstract: General-purpose large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in verticals such as telecommunications, where adaptation is hindered by scarce, low-information-density corpora and tight mobile/edge constraints. We propose Data Trajectory Alignment (DTA), a two-phase, model-agnostic data curation framework that treats solution processes - not only final answers - as first-class supervision. Phase I (Initializing) synthesizes diverse, high-coverage candidates using an ensemble of strong teachers. Phase II (DTA) rewrites teacher solutions to align intermediate steps and presentation style with the target student's inductive biases and then performs signal-aware exemplar selection via agreement checks and reflection-based judging. Instantiated on telecommunications mathematics (e.g., link budgets, SNR/AMC selection, and power-control feasibility), DTA yields state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on TELEMATH without enabling explicit "thinking" modes: 72.45% pass@1, surpassing distilled-only training by +17.65 points and outperforming a strong baseline (Qwen3-32B with thinking enabled) by +2.94 points. Token-shift analyses indicate that DTA concentrates gains on logical-structural discourse markers rather than merely amplifying domain nouns, indicating improved reasoning scaffolding. Under edge-like inference settings, DTA improves efficiency by reducing reliance on multi-sample voting and disabling expensive reasoning heuristics, cutting energy per output token by ~42% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode enabled) and end-to-end latency by ~60% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode disabled). These results demonstrate that aligning how solutions are produced enables compact, high-yield supervision that is effective for both accuracy and efficiency, offering a practical recipe for domain adaptation in low-resource verticals beyond telecom.

Motivation: VAE在推荐系统中常用二进制输入掩码技术来提高性能，但其理论机制尚未充分探索。本文旨在分析VAE在协同过滤中如何实现协作，特别是理解局部协作和全局协作的平衡问题。

Result: 在Netflix、MovieLens-20M和Million Song数据集上验证了分析结果，并在亚马逊流媒体平台上成功部署了提出的算法，通过了在线实验。

Conclusion: VAE在协同过滤中主要利用输入相似用户间的局部协作，而全局协作利用不足。通过适当的正则化和掩码机制可以改善全局混合，锚点正则化器能有效平衡用户身份保持和全局信号共享。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a powerful alternative to matrix factorization for recommendation. A common technique in VAE-based collaborative filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF and show it is governed by latent proximity: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits \emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes global collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms that encourage \emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: (1) $β$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck, promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large; (2) input masking induces stochastic geometric contractions and expansions, which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also introduce neighborhood drift. To preserve user identity while enabling global consistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with item embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal sharing across related items. Our analyses are validated on the Netflix, MovieLens-20M, and Million Song datasets. We also successfully deployed our proposed algorithm on an Amazon streaming platform following a successful online experiment.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging plays a vital role in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. Most existing methods rely heavily on long and continuous EEG recordings, which poses significant challenges for data acquisition in resource-constrained systems, such as wearable or home-based monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose the task of resource-efficient sleep staging, which aims to reduce the amount of signal collected per sleep epoch while maintaining reliable classification performance. To solve this task, we adopt the masking and prompt learning strategy and propose a novel framework called Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS). Specifically, we design a multi-level masking strategy to promote effective feature modeling under partial and irregular observations. To mitigate the loss of contextual information introduced by masking, we further propose a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that aggregates unmasked data into a global prompt, serving as a semantic anchor for guiding both patch-level and epoch-level feature modeling. MASS is evaluated on four datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, especially when the amount of data is very limited. This result highlights its potential for efficient and scalable deployment in real-world low-resource sleep monitoring environments.

Motivation: 现代深度模型参数规模庞大导致推理时内存占用高，限制了实际部署。参数共享能有效减少冗余，但现有方法局限于相邻层共享且缺乏系统性分析，多层共享时配置空间呈指数级增长，形成关键瓶颈。

Method: 从群论角度将参数共享视为在模型参数空间中引入结构对称性，提出基于泰勒展开和Hessian谱的二阶几何准则，通过将扰动投影到Hessian低曲率特征子空间来选择共享组，最小化性能影响。

Result: 在多种架构和任务上，Geo-Sharing始终优于最先进的启发式共享策略，实现了更高的压缩比和更小的精度损失。

Conclusion: Geo-Sharing提供了一个原则性和可扩展的配置过程，成功解决了参数共享中的配置空间爆炸问题，为模型压缩提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Modern deep models have massive parameter sizes, leading to high inference-time memory usage that limits practical deployment. Parameter sharing, a form of structured compression, effectively reduces redundancy, but existing approaches remain heuristic-restricted to adjacent layers and lacking a systematic analysis for cross-layer sharing. However, extending sharing across multiple layers leads to an exponentially expanding configuration space, making exhaustive search computationally infeasible and forming a critical bottleneck for parameter sharing. We recast parameter sharing from a group-theoretic perspective as introducing structural symmetries in the model's parameter space. A sharing configuration can be described by a coloring function $α:L\rightarrow C$ (L: layer indices and C: sharing classes), which determines inter-layer sharing groups while preserving structural symmetry. To determine the coloring function, we propose a second-order geometric criterion based on Taylor expansion and the Hessian spectrum. By projecting perturbations onto the Hessian's low-curvature eigensubspace, the criterion provides an analytic rule for selecting sharing groups that minimize performance impact, yielding a principled and scalable configuration procedure. Across diverse architectures and tasks, Geo-Sharing consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic sharing strategies, achieving higher compression ratios with smaller accuracy degradation.

Abstract: Transitioning to sustainable and resilient energy systems requires navigating complex and interdependent trade-offs across environmental, social, and resource dimensions. Neglecting these trade-offs can lead to unintended consequences across sectors. However, existing assessments often evaluate emerging energy pathways and their impacts in silos, overlooking critical interactions such as regional resource competition and cumulative impacts. We present an integrated modeling framework that couples agent-based modeling and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to simulate how energy transition pathways interact with regional resource competition, ecological constraints, and community-level burdens. We apply the model to a case study in Southern California. The results demonstrate how integrated and multiscale decision making can shape energy pathway deployment and reveal spatially explicit trade-offs under scenario-driven constraints. This modeling framework can further support more adaptive and resilient energy transition planning on spatial and institutional scales.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) extend foundation models to real-world applications by integrating inputs such as text and vision. However, their broad knowledge capacity raises growing concerns about privacy leakage, toxicity mitigation, and intellectual property violations. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a practical solution by selectively forgetting targeted knowledge while preserving overall model utility. When applied to MLLMs, existing neuron-editing-based MU approaches face two fundamental challenges: (1) forgetting becomes inconsistent across modalities because existing point-wise attribution methods fail to capture the structured, layer-by-layer information flow that connects different modalities; and (2) general knowledge performance declines when sensitive neurons that also support important reasoning paths are pruned, as this disrupts the model's ability to generalize. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a multimodal influential neuron path editor (MIP-Editor) for MU. Our approach introduces modality-specific attribution scores to identify influential neuron paths responsible for encoding forget-set knowledge and applies influential-path-aware neuron-editing via representation misdirection. This strategy also enables effective and coordinated forgetting across modalities while preserving the model's general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MIP-Editor achieves a superior unlearning performance on multimodal tasks, with a maximum forgetting rate of 87.75% and up to 54.26% improvement in general knowledge retention. On textual tasks, MIP-Editor achieves up to 80.65% forgetting and preserves 77.9% of general performance. Codes are available at https://github.com/PreckLi/MIP-Editor.

TL;DR: FedNET是一个基于联邦学习的主动隐私保护框架，用于在大规模通信网络中提前识别高风险链路，通过分布式多步流量预测实现早期预警。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集中式方法需要暴露敏感网络数据，而网络运营商需要在不共享原始数据的情况下提前识别潜在的高风险链路，以进行主动流量工程和容量规划。

Method: 采用联邦学习对节点级流量进行分布式建模，结合已知路由信息聚合源-目的地对的流量贡献来估计链路级利用率，然后根据预测的负载强度和时序变异性对链路进行排序。

Result: 联邦学习达到接近集中式训练的准确度，短预测周期准确率最高（R²>0.92），长周期也能提供有意义的预测（R²≈0.45-0.55），能提前三天识别高风险链路。

Conclusion: FedNET是一个实用的工具，能够在关键压力状态出现前提前识别高风险链路，支持预测性流量工程和容量规划，同时保护数据隐私。

Abstract: We propose FedNET, a proactive and privacy-preserving framework for early identification of high-risk links in large-scale communication networks, that leverages a distributed multi-step traffic forecasting method. FedNET employs Federated Learning (FL) to model the temporal evolution of node-level traffic in a distributed manner, enabling accurate multi-step-ahead predictions (e.g., several hours to days) without exposing sensitive network data. Using these node-level forecasts and known routing information, FedNET estimates the future link-level utilization by aggregating traffic contributions across all source-destination pairs. The links are then ranked according to the predicted load intensity and temporal variability, providing an early warning signal for potential high-risk links. We compare the federated traffic prediction of FedNET against a centralized multi-step learning baseline and then systematically analyze the impact of history and prediction window sizes on forecast accuracy using the $R^2$ score. Results indicate that FL achieves accuracy close to centralized training, with shorter prediction horizons consistently yielding the highest accuracy ($R^2 >0.92$), while longer horizons providing meaningful forecasts ($R^2 \approx 0.45\text{--}0.55$). We further validate the efficacy of the FedNET framework in predicting network utilization on a realistic network topology and demonstrate that it consistently identifies high-risk links well in advance (i.e., three days ahead) of the critical stress states emerging, making it a practical tool for anticipatory traffic engineering and capacity planning.

TL;DR: FH-RL机制通过整合快速权重联想记忆、稳态正则化和学习重入反馈，在神经网络中实现自指计算，无需外部循环即可进行内部递归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer架构在推理时仅进行前向传播，缺乏内部递归能力。本研究旨在开发一种能够动态重入先前潜在状态到计算流中的神经机制，模拟自指计算过程。

Method: 提出FH-RL机制，结合快速权重联想记忆、稳态正则化和学习重入反馈。通过控制重入增益γ进行实验，使用IRR、ESRI和RDP三个新指标评估内部动态。

Result: 重入数量随γ成比例增加，学习反馈矩阵Wr保持有界并在中等增益下更结构化。在γ≈0.10-0.20处出现稳定反射带，内部反馈表达性最强且频谱稳定。

Conclusion: 反馈放大和稳态调节的平衡能够产生类似思维的反射性内部处理，将现代快速权重架构与皮层重入和递归认知理论联系起来。

Abstract: This study introduces the Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Layer (FH-RL), a neural mechanism that integrates fast-weight associative memory, homeostatic regularization, and learned reentrant feedback to approximate self-referential computation in neural networks. Unlike standard transformer architectures that operate in a purely feedforward manner during inference, FH-RL enables internal recurrence without external looping, allowing prior latent states to be dynamically re-entered into the ongoing computation stream. We conduct controlled experiments sweeping the reentry gain $γ$ and evaluate emergent internal dynamics using three novel metrics: the Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), and Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Results show that reentry quantity increases proportionally with~$γ$, while the learned feedback matrix $W_r$ remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. Critically, a stable reflective band emerges around $γ\approx 0.10-0.20$, where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI remains near zero, and RDP exhibits consistent low-frequency cycles. These findings provide quantitative evidence that reflective, thought-like internal processing can arise from a principled balance between feedback amplification and homeostatic regulation, linking modern fast-weight architectures to theories of cortical reentry and recursive cognition.

Motivation: 传统牛顿-拉弗森方法虽然稳健准确但计算量大，而纯神经网络方法虽然推理快速但可能在训练分布外失去精度，需要结合两者优势。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法结合了神经算子的效率和传统数值方法的稳健性，有望加速大规模非线性仿真。

Abstract: We propose a Newton-based scheme, initialized by neural operator predictions, to accelerate the parametric solution of nonlinear problems in computational solid mechanics. First, a physics informed conditional neural field is trained to approximate the nonlinear parametric solutionof the governing equations. This establishes a continuous mapping between the parameter and solution spaces, which can then be evaluated for a given parameter at any spatial resolution. Second, since the neural approximation may not be exact, it is subsequently refined using a Newton-based correction initialized by the neural output. To evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach, we compare three solution strategies: (i) the standard Newton-Raphson solver used in NFEM, which is robust and accurate but computationally demanding; (ii) physics-informed neural operators, which provide rapid inference but may lose accuracy outside the training distribution and resolution; and (iii) the neural-initialized Newton (NiN) strategy, which combines the efficiency of neural operators with the robustness of NFEM. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach reduces computational cost while preserving accuracy, highlighting its potential to accelerate large-scale nonlinear simulations.

Conclusion: CtrlFlow生成的多样化轨迹数据显著增强了策略学习的鲁棒性和跨任务泛化能力。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) typically relies on modeling environment dynamics for data efficiency. However, due to the accumulation of model errors over long-horizon rollouts, such methods often face challenges in maintaining modeling stability. To address this, we propose CtrlFlow, a trajectory-level synthetic method using conditional flow matching (CFM), which directly modeling the distribution of trajectories from initial states to high-return terminal states without explicitly modeling the environment transition function. Our method ensures optimal trajectory sampling by minimizing the control energy governed by the non-linear Controllability Gramian Matrix, while the generated diverse trajectory data significantly enhances the robustness and cross-task generalization of policy learning. In online settings, CtrlFlow demonstrates the better performance on common MuJoCo benchmark tasks than dynamics models and achieves superior sample efficiency compared to standard MBRL methods.

Abstract: Monte Carlo random walk methods are widely used in capacitance extraction for their mesh-free formulation and inherent parallelism. However, modern semiconductor technologies with densely packed structures present significant challenges in unbiasedly sampling transition domains in walk steps with multiple high-contrast dielectric materials. We present DeepRWCap, a machine learning-guided random walk solver that predicts the transition quantities required to guide each step of the walk. These include Poisson kernels, gradient kernels, signs and magnitudes of weights. DeepRWCap employs a two-stage neural architecture that decomposes structured outputs into face-wise distributions and spatial kernels on cube faces. It uses 3D convolutional networks to capture volumetric dielectric interactions and 2D depthwise separable convolutions to model localized kernel behavior. The design incorporates grid-based positional encodings and structural design choices informed by cube symmetries to reduce learning redundancy and improve generalization. Trained on 100,000 procedurally generated dielectric configurations, DeepRWCap achieves a mean relative error of $1.24\pm0.53$\% when benchmarked against the commercial Raphael solver on the self-capacitance estimation of 10 industrial designs spanning 12 to 55 nm nodes. Compared to the state-of-the-art stochastic difference method Microwalk, DeepRWCap achieves an average 23\% speedup. On complex designs with runtimes over 10 s, it reaches an average 49\% acceleration.

Motivation: 确定全连接神经网络的最小宽度是深度神经网络理论研究中的基本问题，对网络设计和训练具有重要意义。

Method: 通过数学分析证明不同激活函数下最小宽度的上下界，对于可注入激活函数，使用基于Poincaré-Miranda定理的几何方法构造反例来证明下界。

Result: 对于ELU、SELU激活函数，w_min ≤ max(2d_x+1, d_y)；对于LeakyReLU、ELU、CELU、SELU、Softplus，d_x+1 ≤ w_min ≤ d_x+d_y；对于可注入激活函数，w_min ≥ d_y + 1_{d_x<d_y≤2d_x}。

Conclusion: 论文为不同激活函数的全连接神经网络提供了最小宽度的理论界限，为网络设计提供了理论指导，并提出了新的几何证明方法。

Abstract: Determining the minimum width of fully connected neural networks has become a fundamental problem in recent theoretical studies of deep neural networks. In this paper, we study the lower bounds and upper bounds of the minimum width required for fully connected neural networks in order to have universal approximation capability, which is important in network design and training. We show that $w_{min}\leq\max(2d_x+1, d_y)$ for networks with ELU, SELU, and the upper bound of this inequality is attained when $d_y=2d_x$, where $d_x$, $d_y$ denote the input and output dimensions, respectively. Besides, we show that $d_x+1\leq w_{min}\leq d_x+d_y$ for networks with LeakyReLU, ELU, CELU, SELU, Softplus, by proving that ReLU can be approximated by these activation functions. In addition, in the case that the activation function is injective or can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of injective functions (e.g., ReLU), we present a new proof of the inequality $w_{min}\ge d_y+\mathbf{1}_{d_x<d_y\leq2d_x}$ by constructing a more intuitive example via a new geometric approach based on Poincar$\acute{\text{e}}$-Miranda Theorem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M2M-DC是一个两尺度、形状安全的压缩框架，通过互信息引导的块剪枝与渐进式内部切片和分阶段知识蒸馏相结合，实现高效模型压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个通用的压缩框架，能够在保持残差形状不变性的同时，针对残差CNN和倒残差网络进行高效压缩，实现部署就绪的紧凑模型。

Method: 首先基于标签感知互信息对残差块进行排序并剪除最不重要的块，然后交替进行短知识蒸馏阶段和残差安全的通道切片，包括阶段平面切片和可选的中通道修剪。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上，ResNet-18达到85.46% Top-1准确率，参数和计算量分别减少28%和37%；MobileNetV2准确率提升2.5个百分点，参数和计算量分别减少73%和76%。

Conclusion: M2M-DC提供了一个紧凑实用的压缩方案，能够生成部署就绪的模型，在显著减少计算量的同时保持或超越教师模型的准确率。

Abstract: We introduce MI-to-Mid Distilled Compression (M2M-DC), a two-scale, shape-safe compression framework that interleaves information-guided block pruning with progressive inner slicing and staged knowledge distillation (KD). First, M2M-DC ranks residual (or inverted-residual) blocks by a label-aware mutual information (MI) signal and removes the least informative units (structured prune-after-training). It then alternates short KD phases with stage-coherent, residual-safe channel slicing: (i) stage "planes" (co-slicing conv2 out-channels with the downsample path and next-stage inputs), and (ii) an optional mid-channel trim (conv1 out / bn1 / conv2 in). This targets complementary redundancy, whole computational motifs and within-stage width while preserving residual shape invariants. On CIFAR-100, M2M-DC yields a clean accuracy-compute frontier. For ResNet-18, we obtain 85.46% Top-1 with 3.09M parameters and 0.0139 GMacs (72% params, 63% GMacs vs. teacher; mean final 85.29% over three seeds). For ResNet-34, we reach 85.02% Top-1 with 5.46M params and 0.0195 GMacs (74% / 74% vs. teacher; mean final 84.62%). Extending to inverted-residuals, MobileNetV2 achieves a mean final 68.54% Top-1 at 1.71M params (27%) and 0.0186 conv GMacs (24%), improving over the teacher's 66.03% by +2.5 points across three seeds. Because M2M-DC exposes only a thin, architecture-aware interface (blocks, stages, and down sample/skip wiring), it generalizes across residual CNNs and extends to inverted-residual families with minor legalization rules. The result is a compact, practical recipe for deployment-ready models that match or surpass teacher accuracy at a fraction of the compute.

Conclusion: NCGSB提供了一个更广泛的随机过程类别，能够捕捉更丰富和真实的中间动力学，计算效率高且支持任务特定的引导生成。

Abstract: The Schrödinger Bridge provides a principled framework for modeling stochastic processes between distributions; however, existing methods are limited by energy-conservation assumptions, which constrains the bridge's shape preventing it from model varying-energy phenomena. To overcome this, we introduce the non-conservative generalized Schrödinger bridge (NCGSB), a novel, energy-varying reformulation based on contact Hamiltonian mechanics. By allowing energy to change over time, the NCGSB provides a broader class of real-world stochastic processes, capturing richer and more faithful intermediate dynamics. By parameterizing the Wasserstein manifold, we lift the bridge problem to a tractable geodesic computation in a finite-dimensional space. Unlike computationally expensive iterative solutions, our contact Wasserstein geodesic (CWG) is naturally implemented via a ResNet architecture and relies on a non-iterative solver with near-linear complexity. Furthermore, CWG supports guided generation by modulating a task-specific distance metric. We validate our framework on tasks including manifold navigation, molecular dynamics predictions, and image generation, demonstrating its practical benefits and versatility.

Conclusion: TuckA方法通过多专家集成和高效结构设计，在参数高效微调中实现了优于传统单一专家方法的性能。

Abstract: Efficiently fine-tuning pre-trained models for downstream tasks is a key challenge in the era of foundation models. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) presents a promising solution, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning by updating only a small number of adaptation weights per layer. Traditional PEFT methods typically rely on a single expert, where the adaptation weight is a low-rank matrix. However, for complex tasks, the data's inherent diversity poses a significant challenge for such models, as a single adaptation weight cannot adequately capture the features of all samples. To address this limitation, we explore how to integrate multiple small adaptation experts into a compact structure to defeat a large adapter. Specifically, we propose Tucker Adaptation (TuckA), a method with four key properties: (i) We use Tucker decomposition to create a compact 3D tensor where each slice naturally serves as an expert. The low-rank nature of this decomposition ensures that the number of parameters scales efficiently as more experts are added. (ii) We introduce a hierarchical strategy that organizes these experts into groups at different granularities, allowing the model to capture both local and global data patterns. (iii) We develop an efficient batch-level routing mechanism, which reduces the router's parameter size by a factor of $L$ compared to routing at every adapted layer (where $L$ is the number of adapted layers) (iv) We propose data-aware initialization to achieve loss-free expert load balancing based on theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments on benchmarks in natural language understanding, image classification, and mathematical reasoning speak to the efficacy of TuckA, offering a new and effective solution to the PEFT problem.

Conclusion: DeepBooTS为时间序列预测建立了新的基准，增强了多功能性和可解释性，同时显著提高了对概念漂移的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Time-Series (TS) exhibits pronounced non-stationarity. Consequently, most forecasting methods display compromised robustness to concept drift, despite the prevalent application of instance normalization. We tackle this challenge by first analysing concept drift through a bias-variance lens and proving that weighted ensemble reduces variance without increasing bias. These insights motivate DeepBooTS, a novel end-to-end dual-stream residual-decreasing boosting method that progressively reconstructs the intrinsic signal. In our design, each block of a deep model becomes an ensemble of learners with an auxiliary output branch forming a highway to the final prediction. The block-wise outputs correct the residuals of previous blocks, leading to a learning-driven decomposition of both inputs and targets. This method enhances versatility and interpretability while substantially improving robustness to concept drift. Extensive experiments, including those on large-scale datasets, show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods by a large margin, yielding an average performance improvement of 15.8% across various datasets, establishing a new benchmark for TS forecasting.

Motivation: 基于重建的时间序列异常检测方法普遍依赖MSE损失，导致统计上有缺陷的重建残差，产生噪声大、不稳定的异常分数，影响检测可靠性。

Method: 提出COGNOS框架：1）高斯白噪声正则化策略，在训练时约束模型输出残差符合高斯白噪声分布；2）卡尔曼平滑后处理器，作为统计最优估计器对原始异常分数进行去噪。

Result: 在多个真实世界基准数据集上，COGNOS应用于12种不同骨干模型，平均F分数提升了57.9%。

Conclusion: 直接正则化输出统计特性是显著改进异常检测系统的强大且可泛化的策略。

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods are a dominant paradigm in time series anomaly detection (TSAD), however, their near-universal reliance on Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss results in statistically flawed reconstruction residuals. This fundamental weakness leads to noisy, unstable anomaly scores with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, hindering reliable detection. To address this, we propose Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing (COGNOS), a universal, model-agnostic enhancement framework that tackles this issue at its source. COGNOS introduces a novel Gaussian-White Noise Regularization strategy during training, which directly constrains the model's output residuals to conform to a Gaussian white noise distribution. This engineered statistical property creates the ideal precondition for our second contribution: a Kalman Smoothing Post-processor that provably operates as a statistically optimal estimator to denoise the raw anomaly scores. The synergy between these two components allows COGNOS to robustly separate the true anomaly signal from random fluctuations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGNOS is highly effective, delivering an average F-score uplift of 57.9% when applied to 12 diverse backbone models across multiple real-world benchmark datasets. Our work reveals that directly regularizing output statistics is a powerful and generalizable strategy for significantly improving anomaly detection systems.

Abstract: Accurate day-ahead electricity price forecasting (DAEPF) is critical for the efficient operation of power systems, but extreme condition and market anomalies pose significant challenges to existing forecasting methods. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates a Distilled Attention Transformer (DAT) model and an Autoencoder Self-regression Model (ASM). The DAT leverages a self-attention mechanism to dynamically assign higher weights to critical segments of historical data, effectively capturing both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Concurrently, the ASM employs unsupervised learning to detect and isolate anomalous patterns induced by extreme conditions, such as heavy rain, heat waves, or human festivals. Experiments on datasets sampled from California and Shandong Province demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Our framework thus holds promise for enhancing grid resilience and optimizing market operations in future power systems.

Method: 1. SAMD：将学生SNN的脉冲激活图与教师ANN的类感知激活图对齐，让学生从具有更大语义和分布一致性的显著性激活图中学习；2. NLD：使用高斯噪声平滑学生SNN的稀疏logits，便于与教师ANN的连续logits对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过考虑ANN和SNN的架构差异，提出的SAMD和NLD知识蒸馏策略能够有效提高SNN的训练效果。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) become popular due to excellent energy efficiency, yet facing challenges for effective model training. Recent works improve this by introducing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, with the pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) used as teachers and the target SNNs as students. This is commonly accomplished through a straightforward element-wise alignment of intermediate features and prediction logits from ANNs and SNNs, often neglecting the intrinsic differences between their architectures. Specifically, ANN's outputs exhibit a continuous distribution, whereas SNN's outputs are characterized by sparsity and discreteness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce two innovative KD strategies. Firstly, we propose the Saliency-scaled Activation Map Distillation (SAMD), which aligns the spike activation map of the student SNN with the class-aware activation map of the teacher ANN. Rather than performing KD directly on the raw %and distinct features of ANN and SNN, our SAMD directs the student to learn from saliency activation maps that exhibit greater semantic and distribution consistency. Additionally, we propose a Noise-smoothed Logits Distillation (NLD), which utilizes Gaussian noise to smooth the sparse logits of student SNN, facilitating the alignment with continuous logits from teacher ANN.

Abstract: Currently, machine learning is widely used across various domains, including time series data analysis. However, some machine learning models function as black boxes, making interpretability a critical concern. One approach to address this issue is counterfactual explanation (CE), which aims to provide insights into model predictions. This study focuses on the relatively underexplored problem of generating counterfactual explanations for time series forecasting. We propose a method for extracting CEs in time series forecasting using exogenous variables, which are frequently encountered in fields such as business and marketing. In addition, we present methods for analyzing the influence of each variable over an entire time series, generating CEs by altering only specific variables, and evaluating the quality of the resulting CEs. We validate the proposed method through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, showcasing its accuracy and practical applicability. These contributions are expected to support real-world decision-making based on time series data analysis.

Result: 研究表明采样权重和损失权重能减少随机梯度下降等迭代方法中梯度估计的方差，并通过减少泛化差距来改善泛化性能。

Conclusion: 采样权重和损失权重在数据混合训练中发挥互补作用，联合使用可以同时获得减少梯度方差和改善泛化性能的双重好处。

Abstract: In the training of large deep neural networks, there is a need for vast amounts of training data. To meet this need, data is collected from multiple domains, such as Wikipedia and GitHub. These domains are heterogeneous in both data quality and the diversity of information they provide. This raises the question of how much we should rely on each domain. Several methods have attempted to address this issue by assigning sampling weights to each data domain using heuristics or approximations. As a first step toward a deeper understanding of the role of data mixing, this work revisits the problem by studying two kinds of weights: sampling weights, which control how much each domain contributes in a batch, and loss weights, which scale the loss from each domain during training. Through a rigorous study of linear regression, we show that these two weights play complementary roles. First, they can reduce the variance of gradient estimates in iterative methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Second, they can improve generalization performance by reducing the generalization gap. We provide both theoretical and empirical support for these claims. We further study the joint dynamics of sampling weights and loss weights, examining how they can be combined to capture both contributions.

*Daniel De Dios Allegue,Jinke He,Frans A. Oliehoek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出在Transformer自注意力机制中引入结构化归纳先验，以改善部分可观测环境下基于模型的强化学习效率。主要包含两种先验：记忆长度先验和分布先验（高斯权重）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部分可观测的强化学习中，RL轨迹稀疏且奖励驱动，标准自注意力机制会均匀分配权重给所有历史标记，而不是强调对控制至关重要的少数关键转换。

Method: 在动态头的自注意力机制中引入两种结构化归纳先验：(i) 每头记忆长度先验，将注意力限制在任务特定窗口内；(ii) 分布先验，学习对过去状态-动作对的平滑高斯加权。将这些机制集成到UniZero中。

Result: 在Atari 100k基准测试中，高斯先验实现了77%的相对改进（相对于UniZero的平均人类标准化分数）。大多数效率提升来自高斯先验，它能平滑地将注意力分配给信息丰富的转换。

Conclusion: 在具有非平稳时间依赖关系的部分可观测RL领域中，离散记忆窗口难以可靠学习，而平滑分布先验能灵活适应不同时间范围并产生更稳健的数据效率。将结构化时间先验直接编码到自注意力中能改善部分可观测性下动态建模的信息历史优先级。

Abstract: Transformers have shown strong ability to model long-term dependencies and are increasingly adopted as world models in model-based reinforcement learning (RL) under partial observability. However, unlike natural language corpora, RL trajectories are sparse and reward-driven, making standard self-attention inefficient because it distributes weight uniformly across all past tokens rather than emphasizing the few transitions critical for control. To address this, we introduce structured inductive priors into the self-attention mechanism of the dynamics head: (i) per-head memory-length priors that constrain attention to task-specific windows, and (ii) distributional priors that learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs. We integrate these mechanisms into UniZero, a model-based RL agent with a Transformer-based world model that supports planning under partial observability. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most efficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates attention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate useful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian Attention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores over UniZero. These findings suggest that in partially observable RL domains with non-stationary temporal dependencies, discrete memory windows are difficult to learn reliably, whereas smooth distributional priors flexibly adapt across horizons and yield more robust data efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that encoding structured temporal priors directly into self-attention improves the prioritization of informative histories for dynamics modeling under partial observability.

*Erel Naor,Ofir Lindenbaum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种混合自编码器，结合神经编码器和软决策树编码器，通过模型特定的特征选择实现模型级数据增强，在表格数据上提升小样本学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在表格数据上表现不佳，因为它们对无关特征敏感且偏向低频函数，难以捕捉表格数据中常见的高频信号，特别是在标注样本有限的情况下。

Method: 使用混合自编码器架构，包含神经编码器和软决策树编码器，每个编码器都有自己随机的特征选择门控网络，通过交叉重构损失训练，实现模型级数据增强。

Result: 在多个表格数据集上的低标签分类和回归任务中取得一致性能提升，优于深度和基于树的监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合不同结构编码器的互补优势，有效解决了表格数据上深度神经网络的高频信号捕捉问题，在少样本场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often under-perform on tabular data due to their sensitivity to irrelevant features and a spectral bias toward smooth, low-frequency functions. These limitations hinder their ability to capture the sharp, high-frequency signals that often define tabular structure, especially under limited labeled samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers promise in such settings, it remains challenging in tabular domains due to the lack of effective data augmentations. We propose a hybrid autoencoder that combines a neural encoder with an oblivious soft decision tree (OSDT) encoder, each guided by its own stochastic gating network that performs sample-specific feature selection. Together, these structurally different encoders and model-specific gating networks implement model-based augmentation, producing complementary input views tailored to each architecture. The two encoders, trained with a shared decoder and cross-reconstruction loss, learn distinct yet aligned representations that reflect their respective inductive biases. During training, the OSDT encoder (robust to noise and effective at modeling localized, high-frequency structure) guides the neural encoder toward representations more aligned with tabular data. At inference, only the neural encoder is used, preserving flexibility and SSL compatibility. Spectral analysis highlights the distinct inductive biases of each encoder. Our method achieves consistent gains in low-label classification and regression across diverse tabular datasets, outperforming deep and tree-based supervised baselines.

Motivation: 传统方法无法捕捉定义模板的空间布局和类型模式，需要新的方法来量化电子表格相似性。

Method: 将电子表格转换为单元格级嵌入，然后使用Chamfer和Hausdorff距离等聚合技术计算相似性。

Result: 在FUSTE数据集上实现了完美的模板重建（调整兰德指数1.00 vs 0.90），优于基于图的Mondrian基线。

Conclusion: 该方法支持大规模自动化模板发现，为表格集合的检索增强生成、模型训练和批量数据清理等下游应用提供了基础。

Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying structurally similar spreadsheets fail to capture the spatial layouts and type patterns defining templates. To quantify spreadsheet similarity, we introduce a hybrid distance metric that combines semantic embeddings, data type information, and spatial positioning. In order to calculate spreadsheet similarity, our method converts spreadsheets into cell-level embeddings and then uses aggregation techniques like Chamfer and Hausdorff distances. Experiments across template families demonstrate superior unsupervised clustering performance compared to the graph-based Mondrian baseline, achieving perfect template reconstruction (Adjusted Rand Index of 1.00 versus 0.90) on the FUSTE dataset. Our approach facilitates large-scale automated template discovery, which in turn enables downstream applications such as retrieval-augmented generation over tabular collections, model training, and bulk data cleaning.

Abstract: Efficiently and accurately determining the symmetry is a crucial step in the structural analysis of crystalline materials. Existing methods usually mindlessly apply deep learning models while ignoring the underlying chemical rules. More importantly, experiments show that they face a serious sub-property confusion SPC problem. To address the above challenges, from a decoupled perspective, we introduce the XRDecoupler framework, a problem-solving arsenal specifically designed to tackle the SPC problem. Imitating the thinking process of chemists, we innovatively incorporate multidimensional crystal symmetry information as superclass guidance to ensure that the model's prediction process aligns with chemical intuition. We further design a hierarchical PXRD pattern learning model and a multi-objective optimization approach to achieve high-quality representation and balanced optimization. Comprehensive evaluations on three mainstream databases (e.g., CCDC, CoREMOF, and InorganicData) demonstrate that XRDecoupler excels in performance, interpretability, and generalization.

Abstract: Bayesian inference, while foundational to probabilistic reasoning, is often hampered by the computational intractability of posterior distributions, particularly through the challenging evidence integral. Conventional approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Inference (VI) face significant scalability and efficiency limitations. This paper introduces a novel, unifying framework for fast Bayesian updates by leveraging harmonic analysis. We demonstrate that representing the prior and likelihood in a suitable orthogonal basis transforms the Bayesian update rule into a spectral convolution. Specifically, the Fourier coefficients of the posterior are shown to be the normalized convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients. To achieve computational feasibility, we introduce a spectral truncation scheme, which, for smooth functions, yields an exceptionally accurate finite-dimensional approximation and reduces the update to a circular convolution. This formulation allows us to exploit the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), resulting in a deterministic algorithm with O(N log N) complexity -- a substantial improvement over the O(N^2) cost of naive methods. We establish rigorous mathematical criteria for the applicability of our method, linking its efficiency to the smoothness and spectral decay of the involved distributions. The presented work offers a paradigm shift, connecting Bayesian computation to signal processing and opening avenues for real-time, sequential inference in a wide class of problems.

Conclusion: GLIM支持预训练LLMs适应广泛的战略操纵，在动态战略环境中具有成本效益优势，解决了传统战略分类方法的可扩展性瓶颈。

Abstract: Strategic classification~(SC) explores how individuals or entities modify their features strategically to achieve favorable classification outcomes. However, existing SC methods, which are largely based on linear models or shallow neural networks, face significant limitations in terms of scalability and capacity when applied to real-world datasets with significantly increasing scale, especially in financial services and the internet sector. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage large language models to design a more scalable and efficient SC framework, especially in the case of growing individuals engaged with decision-making processes. Specifically, we introduce GLIM, a gradient-free SC method grounded in in-context learning. During the feed-forward process of self-attention, GLIM implicitly simulates the typical bi-level optimization process of SC, including both the feature manipulation and decision rule optimization. Without fine-tuning the LLMs, our proposed GLIM enjoys the advantage of cost-effective adaptation in dynamic strategic environments. Theoretically, we prove GLIM can support pre-trained LLMs to adapt to a broad range of strategic manipulations. We validate our approach through experiments with a collection of pre-trained LLMs on real-world and synthetic datasets in financial and internet domains, demonstrating that our GLIM exhibits both robustness and efficiency, and offering an effective solution for large-scale SC tasks.

Abstract: Anxiety disorders impact millions globally, yet traditional diagnosis relies on clinical interviews, while machine learning models struggle with overfitting due to limited data. Large-scale data collection remains costly and time-consuming, restricting accessibility. To address this, we introduce the Hyperbolic Curvature Few-Shot Learning Network (HCFSLN), a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) framework for multimodal anxiety detection, integrating speech, physiological signals, and video data. HCFSLN enhances feature separability through hyperbolic embeddings, cross-modal attention, and an adaptive gating network, enabling robust classification with minimal data. We collected a multimodal anxiety dataset from 108 participants and benchmarked HCFSLN against six FSL baselines, achieving 88% accuracy, outperforming the best baseline by 14%. These results highlight the effectiveness of hyperbolic space for modeling anxiety-related speech patterns and demonstrate FSL's potential for anxiety classification.

Abstract: Large models have achieved remarkable performance across a range of reasoning and understanding tasks. Prior work often utilizes model ensembles or multi-agent systems to collaboratively generate responses, effectively operating in a server-to-server paradigm. However, such approaches do not align well with practical deployment settings, where a limited number of server-side models are shared by many clients under modern internet architectures. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CoLM} (\textbf{Co}llaboration in \textbf{L}arge-\textbf{M}odels), a novel framework for collaborative reasoning that redefines cooperation among large models from a client-server perspective. Unlike traditional ensemble methods that rely on simultaneous inference from multiple models to produce a single output, CoLM allows the outputs of multiple models to be aggregated or shared, enabling each client model to independently refine and update its own generation based on these high-quality outputs. This design enables collaborative benefits by fully leveraging both client-side and shared server-side models. We further extend CoLM to vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrating its applicability beyond language tasks. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks show that CoLM consistently improves model performance on previously failed queries, highlighting the effectiveness of collaborative guidance in enhancing single-model capabilities.

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is an essential task in drug discovery, focusing on the identification of small-molecule ligands that bind to specific protein pockets. Existing deep learning methods, from early regression models to recent contrastive learning approaches, primarily rely on structural data while overlooking protein sequences, which are more accessible and can enhance generalizability. However, directly integrating protein sequences poses challenges due to the redundancy and noise in large-scale protein-ligand datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{S$^2$Drug}, a two-stage framework that explicitly incorporates protein \textbf{S}equence information and 3D \textbf{S}tructure context in protein-ligand contrastive representation learning. In the first stage, we perform protein sequence pretraining on ChemBL using an ESM2-based backbone, combined with a tailored data sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and noise on both protein and ligand sides. In the second stage, we fine-tune on PDBBind by fusing sequence and structure information through a residue-level gating module, while introducing an auxiliary binding site prediction task. This auxiliary task guides the model to accurately localize binding residues within the protein sequence and capture their 3D spatial arrangement, thereby refining protein-ligand matching. Across multiple benchmarks, S$^2$Drug consistently improves virtual screening performance and achieves strong results on binding site prediction, demonstrating the value of bridging sequence and structure in contrastive learning.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to detect outliers in graph-structured data, has received increasing research attention recently. However, existing GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions, which is rarely valid in practice. In real-world scenarios, unseen but normal samples may emerge during deployment, leading to a normality shift that degrades the performance of GAD models trained on the original data. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that the degradation arises from (1) semantic confusion, where unseen normal samples are misinterpreted as anomalies due to their novel patterns, and (2) aggregation contamination, where the representations of seen normal nodes are distorted by unseen normals through message aggregation. While retraining or fine-tuning GAD models could be a potential solution to the above challenges, the high cost of model retraining and the difficulty of obtaining labeled data often render this approach impractical in real-world applications. To bridge the gap, we proposed a lightweight and plug-and-play Test-time adaptation framework for correcting Unseen Normal pattErns (TUNE) in GAD. To address semantic confusion, a graph aligner is employed to align the shifted data to the original one at the graph attribute level. Moreover, we utilize the minimization of representation-level shift as a supervision signal to train the aligner, which leverages the estimated aggregation contamination as a key indicator of normality shift. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that TUNE significantly enhances the generalizability of pre-trained GAD models to both synthetic and real unseen normal patterns.

Conclusion: 量化策略相比浮点基线表现出更强的输入噪声鲁棒性，证明了在嵌入式硬件上高效部署强化学习策略的可行性。

Abstract: Deploying continuous-control reinforcement learning policies on embedded hardware requires meeting tight latency and power budgets. Small FPGAs can deliver these, but only if costly floating point pipelines are avoided. We study quantization-aware training (QAT) of policies for integer inference and we present a learning-to-hardware pipeline that automatically selects low-bit policies and synthesizes them to an Artix-7 FPGA. Across five MuJoCo tasks, we obtain policy networks that are competitive with full precision (FP32) policies but require as few as 3 or even only 2 bits per weight, and per internal activation value, as long as input precision is chosen carefully. On the target hardware, the selected policies achieve inference latencies on the order of microseconds and consume microjoules per action, favorably comparing to a quantized reference. Last, we observe that the quantized policies exhibit increased input noise robustness compared to the floating-point baseline.

Result: TAR攻击能够完美重建原始输入数据，首次提供了严谨证据表明联邦聚类中的质心披露会显著损害隐私。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了联邦聚类中隐私与效率之间的根本矛盾，质心发布会严重威胁数据隐私安全。

Abstract: Federated clustering allows multiple parties to discover patterns in distributed data without sharing raw samples. To reduce overhead, many protocols disclose intermediate centroids during training. While often treated as harmless for efficiency, whether such disclosure compromises privacy remains an open question. Prior analyses modeled the problem as a so-called Hidden Subset Sum Problem (HSSP) and argued that centroid release may be safe, since classical HSSP attacks fail to recover inputs.
  We revisit this question and uncover a new leakage mechanism: temporal regularities in $k$-means iterations create exploitable structure that enables perfect input reconstruction. Building on this insight, we propose Trajectory-Aware Reconstruction (TAR), an attack that combines temporal assignment information with algebraic analysis to recover exact original inputs. Our findings provide the first rigorous evidence, supported by a practical attack, that centroid disclosure in federated clustering significantly compromises privacy, exposing a fundamental tension between privacy and efficiency.

Unlike traditional frameworks that focus on regressing scalar quantities and derive tensorial properties from their derivatives, our approach maintains $SO(3)$-equivariance through the use of local coordinate frames. Our GNN effectively captures geometric information by integrating scalar, vector, and tensor channels within a local message-passing framework. To assess the accuracy of our model, we apply it to predict the polarizabilities of molecules in the QM7-X dataset and show that tensorial message passing outperforms scalar message passing models. This work marks an advancement towards developing structured, geometry-aware neural models for molecular property prediction.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在显式潜变量模型中平衡KLD和属性正则化损失的挑战，提出了通过属性变换来同时实现可控性和潜空间正则化的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在平衡KLD和属性正则化损失方面存在困难，当KLD主导时模型缺乏可控性，当属性正则化主导时编码器会违反标准正态先验。

Method: 在符号音乐生成背景下，通过合适的属性变换来同时最小化两个正则化目标，实现可控性和潜空间正则化。

Result: 研究表明现有方法难以同时最小化两个正则化目标，但适当的属性变换可以帮助实现可控性和目标潜维度的正则化。

Conclusion: 通过属性变换可以有效地平衡KLD和属性正则化损失，在保持模型可控性的同时确保潜空间的正则化约束。

Abstract: Explicit latent variable models provide a flexible yet powerful framework for data synthesis, enabling controlled manipulation of generative factors. With latent variables drawn from a tractable probability density function that can be further constrained, these models enable continuous and semantically rich exploration of the output space by navigating their latent spaces. Structured latent representations are typically obtained through the joint minimization of regularization loss functions. In variational information bottleneck models, reconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are often linearly combined with an auxiliary Attribute-Regularization (AR) loss. However, balancing KLD and AR turns out to be a very delicate matter. When KLD dominates over AR, generative models tend to lack controllability; when AR dominates over KLD, the stochastic encoder is encouraged to violate the standard normal prior. We explore this trade-off in the context of symbolic music generation with explicit control over continuous musical attributes. We show that existing approaches struggle to jointly minimize both regularization objectives, whereas suitable attribute transformations can help achieve both controllability and regularization of the target latent dimensions.

TL;DR: REACT-LLM是一个评估LLMs与因果特征结合在临床风险预测中性能的基准测试，发现LLMs在临床预后方面表现尚可但尚未超越传统ML模型，因果特征的整合带来的性能提升有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs和因果学习在临床决策中各有潜力，但它们的协同作用尚未被充分理解，缺乏系统评估它们在临床风险预测中整合的基准。

Method: 引入REACT-LLM基准，评估7个临床结果，比较15个LLMs、6个传统ML模型和3个因果发现算法，分析因果特征与LLMs的整合效果。

Result: LLMs在临床预后方面表现合理但未超越传统ML模型；因果特征与LLMs的整合带来的性能提升有限，主要因为因果发现方法的严格假设在复杂临床数据中常被违反。

Conclusion: 虽然直接整合因果特征到LLMs中改进有限，但基准揭示了更有前景的协同作用方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and causal learning each hold strong potential for clinical decision making (CDM). However, their synergy remains poorly understood, largely due to the lack of systematic benchmarks evaluating their integration in clinical risk prediction. In real-world healthcare, identifying features with causal influence on outcomes is crucial for actionable and trustworthy predictions. While recent work highlights LLMs' emerging causal reasoning abilities, there lacks comprehensive benchmarks to assess their causal learning and performance informed by causal features in clinical risk prediction. To address this, we introduce REACT-LLM, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether combining LLMs with causal features can enhance clinical prognostic performance and potentially outperform traditional machine learning (ML) methods. Unlike existing LLM-clinical benchmarks that often focus on a limited set of outcomes, REACT-LLM evaluates 7 clinical outcomes across 2 real-world datasets, comparing 15 prominent LLMs, 6 traditional ML models, and 3 causal discovery (CD) algorithms. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform reasonably in clinical prognostics, they have not yet outperformed traditional ML models. Integrating causal features derived from CD algorithms into LLMs offers limited performance gains, primarily due to the strict assumptions of many CD methods, which are often violated in complex clinical data. While the direct integration yields limited improvement, our benchmark reveals a more promising synergy.

Conclusion: 该方法首次展示了在多样化音乐属性上的通用性，为专家用户提供了精确的类推子控制能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in high-dimensional time-series data synthesis while providing flexible control through conditioning and guidance. However, existing methodologies primarily rely on musical context or natural language as the main modality of interacting with the generative process, which may not be ideal for expert users who seek precise fader-like control over specific musical attributes. In this work, we explore the application of denoising diffusion processes as plug-and-play latent constraints for unconditional symbolic music generation models. We focus on a framework that leverages a library of small conditional diffusion models operating as implicit probabilistic priors on the latents of a frozen unconditional backbone. While previous studies have explored domain-specific use cases, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate the versatility of such an approach across a diverse array of musical attributes, such as note density, pitch range, contour, and rhythm complexity. Our experiments show that diffusion-driven constraints outperform traditional attribute regularization and other latent constraints architectures, achieving significantly stronger correlations between target and generated attributes while maintaining high perceptual quality and diversity.

Abstract: Discovering functional crystalline materials entails navigating an immense combinatorial design space. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have enabled the sampling of chemically plausible compositions and structures, a fundamental challenge remains: the objective misalignment between likelihood-based sampling in generative modelling and targeted focus on underexplored regions where novel compounds reside. Here, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework that guides latent denoising diffusion models toward diverse and novel, yet thermodynamically viable crystalline compounds. Our approach integrates group relative policy optimisation with verifiable, multi-objective rewards that jointly balance creativity, stability, and diversity. Beyond de novo generation, we demonstrate enhanced property-guided design that preserves chemical validity, while targeting desired functional properties. This approach establishes a modular foundation for controllable AI-driven inverse design that addresses the novelty-validity trade-off across scientific discovery applications of generative models.

Motivation: 疾病爆发监测受到流行病时间序列高噪声的阻碍，而跨数据源的信息聚合在其他领域显示出强大的去噪能力，但在流行病学中尚未充分探索。

Method: LRTrend框架在一个区域内聚合多样化的健康和行为数据流，并学习疾病特定的流行病网络来跨区域聚合信息。

Result: 揭示了美国各地不同的流行病集群和连接，这些连接无法用常用的人类移动网络充分解释；在305个医院转诊区域的COVID-19数据中，经常能在疫情开始后2周内检测到Delta和Omicron波次。

Conclusion: LRTrend能够有效识别疫情爆发，发现的流行病网络可能为未来的公共卫生协调提供信息。

Abstract: Responding to disease outbreaks requires close surveillance of their trajectories, but outbreak detection is hindered by the high noise in epidemic time series. Aggregating information across data sources has shown great denoising ability in other fields, but remains underexplored in epidemiology. Here, we present LRTrend, an interpretable machine learning framework to identify outbreaks in real time. LRTrend effectively aggregates diverse health and behavioral data streams within one region and learns disease-specific epidemic networks to aggregate information across regions. We reveal diverse epidemic clusters and connections across the United States that are not well explained by commonly used human mobility networks and may be informative for future public health coordination. We apply LRTrend to 2 years of COVID-19 data in 305 hospital referral regions and frequently detect regional Delta and Omicron waves within 2 weeks of the outbreak's start, when case counts are a small fraction of the wave's resulting peak.

Abstract: Label learning is a fundamental task in machine learning that aims to construct intelligent models using labeled data, encompassing traditional single-label and multi-label classification models. Traditional methods typically rely on logical labels, such as binary indicators (e.g., "yes/no") that specify whether an instance belongs to a given category. However, in practical applications, label annotations often involve significant uncertainty due to factors such as data noise, inherent ambiguity in the observed entities, and the subjectivity of human annotators. Therefore, representing labels using simplistic binary logic can obscure valuable information and limit the expressiveness of label learning models. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the concept of fuzzy labels, grounded in fuzzy set theory, to better capture and represent label uncertainty. We further propose an efficient fuzzy labeling method that mines and generates fuzzy labels from the original data, thereby enriching the label space with more informative and nuanced representations. Based on this foundation, we present fuzzy-label-enhanced algorithms for both single-label and multi-label learning, using the classical K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and multi-label KNN algorithms as illustrative examples. Experimental results indicate that fuzzy labels can more effectively characterize the real-world labeling information and significantly enhance the performance of label learning models.

Motivation: 现有GNN模型窃取方法依赖大量查询，但现实中允许的查询数量可能严重受限，需要开发在严格查询限制下仍能有效窃取模型的方法。

Method: 首先无需直接查询受害者模型即可获取模型主干，然后策略性地利用固定查询限制来提取最具信息量的数据。

Result: 在八个真实世界数据集上的实验证明了该攻击的有效性，即使在非常严格的查询限制下以及存在模型提取防御措施的情况下仍能成功。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要针对GNN模型提取威胁开发更强大的防御措施。

Abstract: Current graph neural network (GNN) model-stealing methods rely heavily on queries to the victim model, assuming no hard query limits. However, in reality, the number of allowed queries can be severely limited. In this paper, we demonstrate how an adversary can extract the GNN with very limited interactions with the model. Our approach first enables the adversary to obtain the model backbone without making direct queries to the victim model and then to strategically utilize a fixed query limit to extract the most informative data. The experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack, even under a very restricted query limit and under defense against model extraction in place. Our findings underscore the need for robust defenses against GNN model extraction threats.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive generalization abilities, yet adapting them effectively across multiple heterogeneous domains remains challenging due to inter-domain interference. To overcome this challenge, we propose a partition-based multi-stage fine-tuning framework designed to exploit inter-domain synergies while minimizing negative transfer. Our approach strategically partitions domains into subsets (stages) by balancing domain discrepancy, synergy, and model capacity constraints. We theoretically analyze the proposed framework and derive novel generalization bounds that justify our partitioning strategy. Extensive empirical evaluations on various language understanding tasks show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in settings where ensuring robustness, fairness, or domain-specific properties is essential for regulation compliance and alignment with human values. However, especially on Neural Networks, property enforcement is very challenging, and existing methods are limited to specific constraints or local properties (defined around datapoints), or fail to provide full guarantees. We tackle these limitations by extending SMiLE, a recently proposed enforcement framework for NNs, to support global relational properties (defined over the entire input space). The proposed approach scales well with model complexity, accommodates general properties and backbones, and provides full satisfaction guarantees. We evaluate SMiLE on monotonicity, global robustness, and individual fairness, on synthetic and real data, for regression and classification tasks. Our approach is competitive with property-specific baselines in terms of accuracy and runtime, and strictly superior in terms of generality and level of guarantees. Overall, our results emphasize the potential of the SMiLE framework as a platform for future research and applications.

Conclusion: DETECT为医生提供了更客观的治疗效果评估方法，有助于实现更个性化和响应性的患者护理。

Abstract: Chronic pain is a global health challenge affecting millions of individuals, making it essential for physicians to have reliable and objective methods to measure the functional impact of clinical treatments. Traditionally used methods, like the numeric rating scale, while personalized and easy to use, are subjective due to their self-reported nature. Thus, this paper proposes DETECT (Data-Driven Evaluation of Treatments Enabled by Classification Transformers), a data-driven framework that assesses treatment success by comparing patient activities of daily life before and after treatment. We use DETECT on public benchmark datasets and simulated patient data from smartphone sensors. Our results demonstrate that DETECT is objective yet lightweight, making it a significant and novel contribution to clinical decision-making. By using DETECT, independently or together with other self-reported metrics, physicians can improve their understanding of their treatment impacts, ultimately leading to more personalized and responsive patient care.

Abstract: We propose a deep neural-operator framework for a general class of probability models. Under global Lipschitz conditions on the operator over the entire Euclidean space-and for a broad class of probabilistic models-we establish a universal approximation theorem with explicit network-size bounds for the proposed architecture. The underlying stochastic processes are required only to satisfy integrability and general tail-probability conditions. We verify these assumptions for both European and American option-pricing problems within the forward-backward SDE (FBSDE) framework, which in turn covers a broad class of operators arising from parabolic PDEs, with or without free boundaries. Finally, we present a numerical example for a basket of American options, demonstrating that the learned model produces optimal stopping boundaries for new strike prices without retraining.

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental for multiple scientific domains, yet extracting causal information from real world data remains a significant challenge. Given the recent success on real data, we investigate whether TabPFN, a transformer-based tabular foundation model pre-trained on synthetic datasets generated from structural causal models, encodes causal information in its internal representations. We develop an adapter framework using a learnable decoder and causal tokens that extract causal signals from TabPFN's frozen embeddings and decode them into adjacency matrices for causal discovery. Our evaluations demonstrate that TabPFN's embeddings contain causal information, outperforming several traditional causal discovery algorithms, with such causal information being concentrated in mid-range layers. These findings establish a new direction for interpretable and adaptable foundation models and demonstrate the potential for leveraging pre-trained tabular models for causal discovery.

Motivation: 当前时间序列预测领域存在两种主流范式：微调文本大模型和从头训练时间序列基础模型。两者都假设模型规模和数据量越大性能越好，但作者观察到"规模悖论"现象，即更大模型并不带来更好性能。

Result: 在8个先进模型（9000万到60亿参数）上验证，保留不到30%的层在95%以上任务中达到相当或更优精度。具体实验中，仅保留21%参数就能提升12%精度并实现2.7倍推理加速。

Abstract: Large-scale models are at the forefront of time series (TS) forecasting, dominated by two paradigms: fine-tuning text-based Large Language Models (LLM4TS) and training Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) from scratch. Both approaches share a foundational assumption that scaling up model capacity and data volume leads to improved performance. However, we observe a \textit{\textbf{scaling paradox}} in TS models, revealing a puzzling phenomenon that larger models do \emph{NOT} achieve better performance. Through extensive experiments on two model families across four scales (100M to 1.7B parameters) and diverse data (up to 6B observations), we rigorously confirm that the scaling paradox is a pervasive issue. We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training. Based on this discovery, we propose a practical method to automatically identify and retain only these dominant layers. In our models, retaining only 21\% of the parameters achieves up to a 12\% accuracy improvement and a 2.7$\times$ inference speedup. We validate the universality of our method on 8 prominent SOTA models (LLM4TS and TSFMs, 90M to 6B), showing that retaining less than 30\% of layers achieves comparable or superior accuracy in over 95\% of tasks.

Abstract: Multiple clustering aims to discover diverse latent structures from different perspectives, yet existing methods generate exhaustive clusterings without discerning user interest, necessitating laborious manual screening. Current multi-modal solutions suffer from static semantic rigidity: predefined candidate words fail to adapt to dataset-specific concepts, and fixed fusion strategies ignore evolving feature interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-DProxy, a novel multi-modal dynamic proxy learning framework that leverages cross-modal alignment through learnable textual proxies. Multi-DProxy introduces 1) gated cross-modal fusion that synthesizes discriminative joint representations by adaptively modeling feature interactions. 2) dual-constraint proxy optimization where user interest constraints enforce semantic consistency with domain concepts while concept constraints employ hard example mining to enhance cluster discrimination. 3) dynamic candidate management that refines textual proxies through iterative clustering feedback. Therefore, Multi-DProxy not only effectively captures a user's interest through proxies but also enables the identification of relevant clusterings with greater precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements over existing methods across a broad set of multi-clustering benchmarks.

In this paper, we present the first-of-its-kind work that comprehensively investigates the adverse effects of corrupted modalities on multimodal anomaly detection task. To streamline this work, we propose RobustA, a carefully curated evaluation dataset to systematically observe the impacts of audio and visual corruptions on the overall effectiveness of anomaly detection systems. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal anomaly detection method, which shows notable resilience against corrupted modalities. The proposed method learns a shared representation space for different modalities and employs a dynamic weighting scheme during inference based on the estimated level of corruption. Our work represents a significant step forward in enabling the real-world application of multimodal anomaly detection, addressing situations where the likely events of modality corruptions occur. The proposed evaluation dataset with corrupted modalities and respective extracted features will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 消融研究证实了所提框架的合理性和有效性，MG-HGNN为室内定位提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is the primary representation of Wi-Fi fingerprints and serves as a crucial tool for indoor localization. However, existing RSSI-based positioning methods often suffer from reduced accuracy due to environmental complexity and challenges in processing multi-source information. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-graph heterogeneous GNN framework (MG-HGNN) to enhance spatial awareness and improve positioning performance. In this framework, two graph construction branches perform node and edge embedding, respectively, to generate informative graphs. Subsequently, a heterogeneous graph neural network is employed for graph representation learning, enabling accurate positioning. The MG-HGNN framework introduces the following key innovations: 1) multi-type task-directed graph construction that combines label estimation and feature encoding for richer graph information; 2) a heterogeneous GNN structure that enhances the performance of conventional GNN models. Evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc public datasets demonstrate that MG-HGNN not only achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods, but also provides a novel perspective for enhancing GNN-based localization methods. Ablation studies further confirm the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习训练复杂策略时存在不稳定和收敛慢的问题，而最先进的模仿学习方法如GAIL由于基于在线策略算法导致样本效率低下

Method: 将离策略框架与双Q网络稳定化技术、无需奖励函数推断的价值学习相结合

Result: 减少了匹配专家行为所需的样本数量

Conclusion: 离策略学习可以显著提高对抗模仿学习的样本效率

Abstract: Learning complex policies with Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by instability and slow convergence, a problem exacerbated by the difficulty of reward engineering. Imitation Learning (IL) from expert demonstrations bypasses this reliance on rewards. However, state-of-the-art IL methods, exemplified by Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL)Ho et. al, suffer from severe sample inefficiency. This is a direct consequence of their foundational on-policy algorithms, such as TRPO Schulman et.al. In this work, we introduce an adversarial imitation learning algorithm that incorporates off-policy learning to improve sample efficiency. By combining an off-policy framework with auxiliary techniques specifically, double Q network based stabilization and value learning without reward function inference we demonstrate a reduction in the samples required to robustly match expert behavior.

Conclusion: 该框架为解释训练动态提供了理论基础，可能指导超参数调优和学习率调度器的设计。

Abstract: Understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks remains a major open problem, with physics-inspired approaches offering promising insights. Building on this perspective, we develop a thermodynamic framework to describe the stationary distributions of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with weight decay for scale-invariant neural networks, a setting that both reflects practical architectures with normalization layers and permits theoretical analysis. We establish analogies between training hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, weight decay) and thermodynamic variables such as temperature, pressure, and volume. Starting with a simplified isotropic noise model, we uncover a close correspondence between SGD dynamics and ideal gas behavior, validated through theory and simulation. Extending to training of neural networks, we show that key predictions of the framework, including the behavior of stationary entropy, align closely with experimental observations. This framework provides a principled foundation for interpreting training dynamics and may guide future work on hyperparameter tuning and the design of learning rate schedulers.

Result: 不仅达到了人类顶级水平，还实现了远超人类的超级水平，且训练成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: Stratego游戏中的AI性能取得了革命性突破，证明在有限预算下也能实现超级人类水平的AI。

Abstract: Few classical games have been regarded as such significant benchmarks of artificial intelligence as to have justified training costs in the millions of dollars. Among these, Stratego -- a board wargame exemplifying the challenge of strategic decision making under massive amounts of hidden information -- stands apart as a case where such efforts failed to produce performance at the level of top humans. This work establishes a step change in both performance and cost for Stratego, showing that it is now possible not only to reach the level of top humans, but to achieve vastly superhuman level -- and that doing so requires not an industrial budget, but merely a few thousand dollars. We achieved this result by developing general approaches for self-play reinforcement learning and test-time search under imperfect information.

Conclusion: Q-RAG为多步检索提供了一种竞争性强且资源高效的替代方案

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods enhance LLM performance by efficiently filtering relevant context for LLMs, reducing hallucinations and inference cost. However, most existing RAG methods focus on single-step retrieval, which is often insufficient for answering complex questions that require multi-step search. Recently, multi-step retrieval approaches have emerged, typically involving the fine-tuning of small LLMs to perform multi-step retrieval. This type of fine-tuning is highly resource-intensive and does not enable the use of larger LLMs. In this work, we propose Q-RAG, a novel approach that fine-tunes the Embedder model for multi-step retrieval using reinforcement learning (RL). Q-RAG offers a competitive, resource-efficient alternative to existing multi-step retrieval methods for open-domain question answering and achieves state-of-the-art results on the popular long-context benchmarks Babilong and RULER for contexts up to 10M tokens.

Abstract: It introduces FractalNet, a fractal-inspired computational architectures for advanced large language model analysis that mainly challenges model diversity on a large scale in an efficient manner. The new set-up involves a template-driven generator, runner, and evaluation framework that, through systematic permutations of convolutional, normalization, activation, and dropout layers, can create more than 1,200 variants of neural networks. Fractal templates allow for structural recursion and multi-column pathways, thus, models become deeper and wider in a balanced way. Training utilizes PyTorch, Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), and gradient checkpointing and is carried out on the CIFAR-10 dataset for five epochs. The outcomes show that fractal-based architectures are capable of strong performance and are computationally efficient. The paper positions fractal design as a feasible and resource-efficient method of automated architecture exploration.

Conclusion: 高质量、专家驱动的数据集对推进通用计算机使用代理发展至关重要。

Abstract: Building reliable computer-use agents requires grounding: accurately connecting natural language instructions to the correct on-screen elements. While large datasets exist for web and mobile interactions, high-quality resources for desktop environments are limited. To address this gap, we introduce GroundCUA, a large-scale desktop grounding dataset built from expert human demonstrations. It covers 87 applications across 12 categories and includes 56K screenshots, with every on-screen element carefully annotated for a total of over 3.56M human-verified annotations. From these demonstrations, we generate diverse instructions that capture a wide range of real-world tasks, providing high-quality data for model training. Using GroundCUA, we develop the GroundNext family of models that map instructions to their target UI elements. At both 3B and 7B scales, GroundNext achieves state-of-the-art results across five benchmarks using supervised fine-tuning, while requiring less than one-tenth the training data of prior work. Reinforcement learning post-training further improves performance, and when evaluated in an agentic setting on the OSWorld benchmark using o3 as planner, GroundNext attains comparable or superior results to models trained with substantially more data,. These results demonstrate the critical role of high-quality, expert-driven datasets in advancing general-purpose computer-use agents.

TL;DR: TNT是一种新的训练范式，通过两阶段过程解决深度记忆RNN训练效率问题：第一阶段使用分层内存进行效率优化预训练，第二阶段进行小规模高分辨率微调，实现17倍训练加速同时提升模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度记忆RNN（如Titans和TTT）虽然具有线性扩展优势，但由于训练速度极慢和硬件利用率低，其潜力未能充分发挥。现有并行化方法存在chunksize超参数的根本冲突：大块提升速度但降低性能。

Method: 两阶段训练范式：第一阶段使用分层内存进行效率优化预训练，全局模块处理大块长程上下文，并行本地模块处理细粒度细节，通过定期重置本地内存状态打破顺序依赖；第二阶段仅对本地内存模块进行小规模高分辨率微调。

Result: 在Titans和TTT模型上评估，TNT实现了高达17倍的训练加速，同时提高了模型精度，突破了深度记忆RNN的可扩展性瓶颈。

Conclusion: TNT为开发表达能力强的RNN奠定了实用基础，有助于未来工作缩小与Transformer的性能差距。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with deep test-time memorization modules, such as Titans and TTT, represent a promising, linearly-scaling paradigm distinct from Transformers. While these expressive models do not yet match the peak performance of state-of-the-art Transformers, their potential has been largely untapped due to prohibitively slow training and low hardware utilization. Existing parallelization methods force a fundamental conflict governed by the chunksize hyperparameter: large chunks boost speed but degrade performance, necessitating a fixed, suboptimal compromise. To solve this challenge, we introduce TNT, a novel training paradigm that decouples training efficiency from inference performance through a two-stage process. Stage one is an efficiency-focused pre-training phase utilizing a hierarchical memory. A global module processes large, hardware-friendly chunks for long-range context, while multiple parallel local modules handle fine-grained details. Crucially, by periodically resetting local memory states, we break sequential dependencies to enable massive context parallelization. Stage two is a brief fine-tuning phase where only the local memory modules are adapted to a smaller, high-resolution chunksize, maximizing accuracy with minimal overhead. Evaluated on Titans and TTT models, TNT achieves a substantial acceleration in training speed-up to 17 times faster than the most accurate baseline configuration - while simultaneously improving model accuracy. This improvement removes a critical scalability barrier, establishing a practical foundation for developing expressive RNNs and facilitating future work to close the performance gap with Transformers.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在高风险多步推理任务中的可靠性和故障检测至关重要，现有方法主要关注单步输出，忽视了多步推理的挑战。

Method: 将自评估技术扩展到多步任务，测试了两种直观方法：整体评分和逐步评分，使用两个多步基准数据集进行评估。

Result: 逐步评估在检测潜在错误方面通常优于整体评分，AUC-ROC相对提升高达15%。

Conclusion: 自评估LLM系统在复杂推理中提供有意义的置信度估计，提高了可信度，并为故障检测提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Reliability and failure detection of large language models (LLMs) is critical for their deployment in high-stakes, multi-step reasoning tasks. Prior work explores confidence estimation for self-evaluating LLM-scorer systems, with confidence scorers estimating the likelihood of errors in LLM responses. However, most methods focus on single-step outputs and overlook the challenges of multi-step reasoning. In this work, we extend self-evaluation techniques to multi-step tasks, testing two intuitive approaches: holistic scoring and step-by-step scoring. Using two multi-step benchmark datasets, we show that stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC. Our findings demonstrate that self-evaluating LLM systems provide meaningful confidence estimates in complex reasoning, improving their trustworthiness and providing a practical framework for failure detection.

Motivation: 解决后训练中的探索悖论：为什么探索在RLVR和ORM/PRM主要强化现有推理路径的情况下仍然重要。

Method: 采用多任务树状马尔可夫链模型，将预训练视为树扩展，后训练视为思维链重加权，分析后训练动态。

Result: 发现：(1)RLVR产生挤压效应，减少推理熵并遗忘正确路径；(2)ORM/PRM鼓励一致性而非准确性；(3)基础模型的罕见高不确定性推理路径解决困难问题。

Conclusion: 探索之所以重要，是因为它保留了解决困难问题所需的关键但罕见的推理轨迹，这些轨迹会被RLVR挤压或被推理缩放所忽视。

Abstract: Foundation models exhibit broad knowledge but limited task-specific reasoning, motivating post-training strategies such as RLVR and inference scaling with outcome or process reward models (ORM/PRM). While recent work highlights the role of exploration and entropy stability in improving pass@K, empirical evidence points to a paradox: RLVR and ORM/PRM typically reinforce existing tree-like reasoning paths rather than expanding the reasoning scope, raising the question of why exploration helps at all if no new patterns emerge.
  To reconcile this paradox, we adopt the perspective of Kim et al. (2025), viewing easy (e.g., simplifying a fraction) versus hard (e.g., discovering a symmetry) reasoning steps as low- versus high-probability Markov transitions, and formalize post-training dynamics through Multi-task Tree-structured Markov Chains (TMC). In this tractable model, pretraining corresponds to tree expansion, while post-training corresponds to chain-of-thought reweighting. We show that several phenomena recently observed in empirical studies arise naturally in this setting: (1) RLVR induces a squeezing effect, reducing reasoning entropy and forgetting some correct paths; (2) population rewards of ORM/PRM encourage consistency rather than accuracy, thereby favoring common patterns; and (3) certain rare, high-uncertainty reasoning paths by the base model are responsible for solving hard problem instances.
  Together, these explain why exploration -- even when confined to the base model's reasoning scope -- remains essential: it preserves access to rare but crucial reasoning traces needed for difficult cases, which are squeezed out by RLVR or unfavored by inference scaling. Building on this, we further show that exploration strategies such as rejecting easy instances and KL regularization help preserve rare reasoning traces. Empirical simulations corroborate our theoretical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前观察到课程学习技术在LLM后训练阶段能显著提升推理性能，但其工作原理和有效范围缺乏理论理解，需要建立理论框架来解释为什么以及到什么程度课程学习有效。

Method: 基于链式思考解决数学问题的洞察，将CoT生成建模为状态条件自回归推理树，定义均匀分支基础模型来捕捉预训练行为，并将课程阶段形式化为深度增加（更长推理链）或提示减少（更短前缀）的子任务。

Result: 分析表明，在仅结果奖励信号下，强化学习微调能以多项式样本复杂度实现高准确率，而直接学习则遭受指数级瓶颈。测试时缩放也有类似保证，课程感知查询将奖励oracle调用和采样成本从指数级降至多项式级。

Conclusion: 课程后训练在满足连续课程阶段间的温和复杂度条件下，能够避免指数级复杂度瓶颈，为课程学习在LLM推理提升中的有效性提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Recent curriculum techniques in the post-training stage of LLMs have been widely observed to outperform non-curriculum approaches in enhancing reasoning performance, yet a principled understanding of why and to what extent they work remains elusive. To address this gap, we develop a theoretical framework grounded in the intuition that progressively learning through manageable steps is more efficient than directly tackling a hard reasoning task, provided each stage stays within the model's effective competence. Under mild complexity conditions linking consecutive curriculum stages, we show that curriculum post-training avoids the exponential complexity bottleneck.
  To substantiate this result, drawing insights from the Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) solving mathematical problems such as Countdown and parity, we model CoT generation as a states-conditioned autoregressive reasoning tree, define a uniform-branching base model to capture pretrained behavior, and formalize curriculum stages as either depth-increasing (longer reasoning chains) or hint-decreasing (shorter prefixes) subtasks. Our analysis shows that, under outcome-only reward signals, reinforcement learning finetuning achieves high accuracy with polynomial sample complexity, whereas direct learning suffers from an exponential bottleneck. We further establish analogous guarantees for test-time scaling, where curriculum-aware querying reduces both reward oracle calls and sampling cost from exponential to polynomial order.

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as financial forecasting, recommendation systems, and fraud detection. However, their susceptibility to poisoning attacks poses a critical security risk. We introduce LoReTTA (Low Resource Two-phase Temporal Attack), a novel adversarial framework on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs, which degrades TGNN performance by an average of 29.47% across 4 widely benchmark datasets and 4 State-of-the-Art (SotA) models. LoReTTA operates through a two-stage approach: (1) sparsify the graph by removing high-impact edges using any of the 16 tested temporal importance metrics, (2) strategically replace removed edges with adversarial negatives via LoReTTA's novel degree-preserving negative sampling algorithm. Our plug-and-play design eliminates the need for expensive surrogate models while adhering to realistic unnoticeability constraints. LoReTTA degrades performance by upto 42.0% on MOOC, 31.5% on Wikipedia, 28.8% on UCI, and 15.6% on Enron. LoReTTA outperforms 11 attack baselines, remains undetectable to 4 leading anomaly detection systems, and is robust to 4 SotA adversarial defense training methods, establishing its effectiveness, unnoticeability, and robustness.

Conclusion: SCISOR在蛋白质缩短任务中优于先前的进化序列模型，能够生成更真实的蛋白质并更好地保留功能基序。

Abstract: Many proteins useful in modern medicine or bioengineering are challenging to make in the lab, fuse with other proteins in cells, or deliver to tissues in the body, because their sequences are too long. Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on ProteinGym. Finally, we use the SCISOR de-noiser to shrink long protein sequences, and show that its suggested deletions result in significantly more realistic proteins and more often preserve functional motifs than previous models of evolutionary sequences.

Conclusion: 基于原则的无标签级联优化方法能够实现可扩展的LLM部署，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on complex reasoning tasks, but their high inference cost remains a major barrier to real-world deployment. A promising solution is to use cascaded inference, where small, cheap models handle easy queries, and only the hardest examples are escalated to more powerful models. However, existing cascade methods typically rely on supervised training with labeled data, offer no theoretical generalization guarantees, and provide limited control over test-time computational cost. We introduce C3PO (Cost Controlled Cascaded Prediction Optimization), a self-supervised framework for optimizing LLM cascades under probabilistic cost constraints. By focusing on minimizing regret with respect to the most powerful model (MPM), C3PO avoids the need for labeled data by constructing a cascade using only unlabeled model outputs. It leverages conformal prediction to bound the probability that inference cost exceeds a user-specified budget. We provide theoretical guarantees on both cost control and generalization error, and show that our optimization procedure is effective even with small calibration sets. Empirically, C3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of reasoning benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH-500, BigBench-Hard and AIME, outperforming strong LLM cascading baselines in both accuracy and cost-efficiency. Our results demonstrate that principled, label-free cascade optimization can enable scalable LLM deployment.

Abstract: Simulating trajectories of multi-particle systems on complex energy landscapes is a central task in molecular dynamics (MD) and drug discovery, but remains challenging at scale due to computationally expensive and long simulations. Previous approaches leverage techniques such as flow or Schrödinger bridge matching to implicitly learn joint trajectories through data snapshots. However, many systems, including biomolecular systems and heterogeneous cell populations, undergo dynamic interactions that evolve over their trajectory and cannot be captured through static snapshots. To close this gap, we introduce Entangled Schrödinger Bridge Matching (EntangledSBM), a framework that learns the first- and second-order stochastic dynamics of interacting, multi-particle systems where the direction and magnitude of each particle's path depend dynamically on the paths of the other particles. We define the Entangled Schrödinger Bridge (EntangledSB) problem as solving a coupled system of bias forces that entangle particle velocities. We show that our framework accurately simulates heterogeneous cell populations under perturbations and rare transitions in high-dimensional biomolecular systems.

### [246] [Routing Manifold Alignment Improves Generalization of Mixture-of-Experts LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07419)
*Zhongyang Li,Ziyue Li,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了路由流形对齐(RoMA)方法，通过将路由权重流形与任务嵌入流形对齐，有效缩小MoE LLMs中路由器的性能差距，仅需轻量级微调路由器即可显著提升模型泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE LLMs中的路由器在广泛下游任务评估中表现不佳，与最优路由存在10-20%的准确率差距，这限制了MoE模型的泛化能力。

Method: RoMA方法在训练目标中引入额外的流形正则化项，仅微调路由器参数（其他参数冻结）。该正则化鼓励每个样本的路由权重在任务嵌入空间中接近其成功邻居（路由权重能得出正确答案的样本）的路由权重。

Result: 在OLMoE、DeepSeekMoE和Qwen3-MoE上的实验表明，RoMA在多样化基准测试中带来了显著改进，与基线相比性能大幅提升。

Conclusion: RoMA展示了将任务理解（通过嵌入模型）与解决方案生成（通过MoE LLMs）统一起来的优势，通过在不同样本上建立任务与专家之间的绑定关系，实现了更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have been widely adopted in recent large language models since it can efficiently scale up the model capability without increasing the inference cost. However, evaluations on broad downstream tasks reveal a consistent suboptimality of the routers in existing MoE LLMs, which results in a severe performance gap (e.g., 10-20% in accuracy) to the optimal routing. In this paper, we show that aligning the manifold of routing weights with that of task embedding can effectively reduce the gap and improve MoE LLMs' generalization performance. Our method, "Routing Manifold Alignment (RoMA)", introduces an additional manifold regularization term in the post-training objective and only requires lightweight finetuning of routers (with other parameters frozen). Specifically, the regularization encourages the routing weights of each sample to be close to those of its successful neighbors (whose routing weights lead to correct answers) in a task embedding space. Consequently, samples targeting similar tasks will share similar expert choices across layers. Building such bindings between tasks and experts over different samples is essential to achieve better generalization. Moreover, RoMA demonstrates the advantage of unifying the task understanding (by embedding models) with solution generation (by MoE LLMs). In experiments, we finetune routers in OLMoE, DeepSeekMoE, and Qwen3-MoE using RoMA. Evaluations on diverse benchmarks and extensive comparisons with baselines show the substantial improvement brought by RoMA.

Conclusion: 这些结果为分析真实世界高斯过程数据的高效蒙特卡洛算法奠定了基础，强调了开发可定制库集的必要性，允许用户整合动态编程对象并根据模型结构精细优化自动微分模式。

Abstract: Hierarchical Bayesian models based on Gaussian processes are considered useful for describing complex nonlinear statistical dependencies among variables in real-world data. However, effective Monte Carlo algorithms for inference with these models have not yet been established, except for several simple cases. In this study, we show that, compared with the slow inference achieved with existing program libraries, the performance of Riemannian-manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC) can be drastically improved by optimising the computation order according to the model structure and dynamically programming the eigendecomposition. This improvement cannot be achieved when using an existing library based on a naive automatic differentiator. We numerically demonstrate that RMHMC effectively samples from the posterior, allowing the calculation of model evidence, in a Bayesian logistic regression on simulated data and in the estimation of propensity functions for the American national medical expenditure data using several Bayesian multiple-kernel models. These results lay a foundation for implementing effective Monte Carlo algorithms for analysing real-world data with Gaussian processes, and highlight the need to develop a customisable library set that allows users to incorporate dynamically programmed objects and finely optimises the mode of automatic differentiation depending on the model structure.

Abstract: Interpretable representation learning is a central challenge in modern machine learning, particularly in high-dimensional settings such as neuroimaging, genomics, and text analysis. Current methods often struggle to balance the competing demands of interpretability and model flexibility, limiting their effectiveness in extracting meaningful insights from complex data. We introduce Non-negative Stiefel Approximating Flow (NSA-Flow), a general-purpose matrix estimation framework that unifies ideas from sparse matrix factorization, orthogonalization, and constrained manifold learning. NSA-Flow enforces structured sparsity through a continuous balance between reconstruction fidelity and column-wise decorrelation, parameterized by a single tunable weight. The method operates as a smooth flow near the Stiefel manifold with proximal updates for non-negativity and adaptive gradient control, yielding representations that are simultaneously sparse, stable, and interpretable. Unlike classical regularization schemes, NSA-Flow provides an intuitive geometric mechanism for manipulating sparsity at the level of global structure while simplifying latent features. We demonstrate that the NSA-Flow objective can be optimized smoothly and integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines for dimensionality reduction while improving interpretability and generalization in both simulated and real biomedical data. Empirical validation on the Golub leukemia dataset and in Alzheimer's disease demonstrate that the NSA-Flow constraints can maintain or improve performance over related methods with little additional methodological effort. NSA-Flow offers a scalable, general-purpose tool for interpretable ML, applicable across data science domains.

Abstract: Supply chain disruptions and volatile demand pose significant challenges to the UK automotive industry, which relies heavily on Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing. While qualitative studies highlight the potential of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with traditional optimization, a formal, quantitative demonstration of this synergy is lacking. This paper introduces a novel stochastic learning-optimization framework that integrates Bayesian inference with inventory optimization for supply chain management (SCM). We model a two-echelon inventory system subject to stochastic demand and supply disruptions, comparing a traditional static optimization policy against an adaptive policy where Bayesian learning continuously updates parameter estimates to inform stochastic optimization. Our simulations over 365 periods across three operational scenarios demonstrate that the integrated approach achieves 7.4\% cost reduction in stable environments and 5.7\% improvement during supply disruptions, while revealing important limitations during sudden demand shocks due to the inherent conservatism of Bayesian updating. This work provides mathematical validation for practitioner observations and establishes a formal framework for understanding AI-driven supply chain resilience, while identifying critical boundary conditions for successful implementation.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude 3.5, underscores the need to distinguish LLM-generated text from human-written content to mitigate the spread of misinformation and misuse in education. One promising approach to address this issue is the watermark technique, which embeds subtle statistical signals into LLM-generated text to enable reliable identification. In this paper, we first generalize the likelihood-based LLM detection method of a previous study by introducing a flexible weighted formulation, and further adapt this approach to the inverse transform sampling method. Moving beyond watermark detection, we extend this adaptive detection strategy to tackle the more challenging problem of segmenting a given text into watermarked and non-watermarked substrings. In contrast to the approach in a previous study, which relies on accurate estimation of next-token probabilities that are highly sensitive to prompt estimation, our proposed framework removes the need for precise prompt estimation. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology is both effective and robust in accurately segmenting texts containing a mixture of watermarked and non-watermarked content.

Abstract: Random forests are a statistical learning technique that use bootstrap aggregation to average high-variance and low-bias trees. Improvements to random forests, such as applying Lasso regression to the tree predictions, have been proposed in order to reduce model bias. However, these changes can sometimes degrade performance (e.g., an increase in mean squared error). In this paper, we show in theory that the relative performance of these two methods, standard and Lasso-weighted random forests, depends on the signal-to-noise ratio. We further propose a unified framework to combine random forests and Lasso selection by applying adaptive weighting and show mathematically that it can strictly outperform the other two methods. We compare the three methods through simulation, including bias-variance decomposition, error estimates evaluation, and variable importance analysis. We also show the versatility of our method by applications to a variety of real-world datasets.

Abstract: In many areas of systems biology, including virology, pharmacokinetics, and population biology, dynamical systems are commonly used to describe biological processes. These systems can be characterized by estimating their parameters from sampled data. The key problem is how to optimally select sampling points to achieve accurate parameter estimation. Classical approaches often rely on Fisher information matrix-based criteria such as A-, D-, and E-optimality, which require an initial parameter estimate and may yield suboptimal results when the estimate is inaccurate. This study proposes two simulation-based methods for optimal sampling design that do not depend on initial parameter estimates. The first method, E-optimal-ranking (EOR), employs the E-optimal criterion, while the second utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Simulation studies based on the Lotka-Volterra and three-compartment models demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform both random selection and classical E-optimal design.

Abstract: We study language generation in the limit, where an algorithm observes an adversarial enumeration of strings from an unknown target language $K$ and must eventually generate new, unseen strings from $K$. Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] proved that generation is achievable in surprisingly general settings. But their generator suffers from ``mode collapse,'' producing from an ever-smaller subset of the target. To address this, Kleinberg and Wei [KW25] require the generator's output to be ``dense'' in the target language. They showed that generation with density, surprisingly, remains achievable at the same generality.
  Both results assume perfect data: no noisy insertions and no omissions. This raises a central question: how much contamination can generation tolerate? Recent works made partial progress on this question by studying (non-dense) generation with either finite amounts of noise (but no omissions) or omissions (but no noise).
  We characterize robustness under contaminated enumerations: 1. Generation under Contamination: Language generation in the limit is achievable for all countable collections iff the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. When this fails, we characterize which collections are generable. 2. Dense Generation under Contamination: Dense generation is strictly less robust to contamination than generation. As a byproduct, we resolve an open question of Raman and Raman [ICML25] by showing that generation is possible with only membership oracle access under finitely many contaminated examples.
  Finally, we introduce a beyond-worst-case model inspired by curriculum learning and prove that dense generation is achievable even with infinite contamination provided the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. This suggests curriculum learning may be crucial for learning from noisy web data.

Abstract: Validation plays a crucial role in the clustering process. Many different internal validity indexes exist for the purpose of determining the best clustering solution(s) from a given collection of candidates, e.g., as produced by different algorithms or different algorithm hyper-parameters. In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmark study of 26 internal validity indexes, which includes highly popular classic indexes as well as more recently developed ones. We adopted an enhanced revision of the methodology presented in Vendramin et al. (2010), developed here to address several shortcomings of this previous work. This overall new approach consists of three complementary custom-tailored evaluation sub-methodologies, each of which has been designed to assess specific aspects of an index's behaviour while preventing potential biases of the other sub-methodologies. Each sub-methodology features two complementary measures of performance, alongside mechanisms that allow for an in-depth investigation of more complex behaviours of the internal validity indexes under study. Additionally, a new collection of 16177 datasets has been produced, paired with eight widely-used clustering algorithms, for a wider applicability scope and representation of more diverse clustering scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of hyperparameter estimation within the empirical Bayes framework (EBF) for sparse learning. By studying the influence of hyperpriors on the solution of EBF, we establish a theoretical connection between the choice of the hyperprior and the sparsity as well as the local optimality of the resulting solutions. We show that some strictly increasing hyperpriors, such as half-Laplace and half-generalized Gaussian with the power in $(0,1)$, effectively promote sparsity and improve solution stability with respect to measurement noise. Based on this analysis, we adopt a proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm with convergence guaranties for both convex and concave hyperpriors. Extensive numerical tests on two-dimensional image deblurring problems demonstrate that introducing appropriate hyperpriors significantly promotes the sparsity of the solution and enhances restoration accuracy. Furthermore, we illustrate the influence of the noise level and the ill-posedness of inverse problems to EBF solutions.

Abstract: Learning-based methods for sampling from the Gibbs distribution in finite-dimensional spaces have progressed quickly, yet theory and algorithmic design for infinite-dimensional function spaces remain limited. This gap persists despite their strong potential for sampling the paths of conditional diffusion processes, enabling efficient simulation of trajectories of diffusion processes that respect rare events or boundary constraints. In this work, we present the adjoint sampler for infinite-dimensional function spaces, a stochastic optimal control-based diffusion sampler that operates in function space and targets Gibbs-type distributions on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Our Functional Adjoint Sampler (FAS) generalizes Adjoint Sampling (Havens et al., 2025) to Hilbert spaces based on a SOC theory called stochastic maximum principle, yielding a simple and scalable matching-type objective for a functional representation. We show that FAS achieves superior transition path sampling performance across synthetic potential and real molecular systems, including Alanine Dipeptide and Chignolin.
