The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm\nrandomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,\ninformed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and\ntiming of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.\n  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,\nrandom, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms\nreceived nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science\nprinciples. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm\nreceived nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA\nbarriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We\nincluded 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,\nbaseline steps 5,618.2).\n  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups\nfrom baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased\naverage daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296\nsteps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,\np=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared\nto the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation\nmodels also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.\ncontrol (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a\nscalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health\ninterventions for PA.", "AI": {"tldr": "PEARL\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5065\u5eb7\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aRL\u7ec4\u57281\u4e2a\u6708\u548c2\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\u6b65\u6570\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u7403\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd0\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22mHealth\u5e72\u9884\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fJITAIs\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "13,463\u540dFitbit\u7528\u6237\u968f\u673a\u5206\u4e3a\u56db\u7ec4\uff08\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u968f\u673a\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u3001RL\uff09\uff0cRL\u7ec4\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u9001\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "RL\u7ec4\u57281\u4e2a\u6708\u548c2\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\u6b65\u6570\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7ec4\uff08\u59821\u4e2a\u6708\u65f6\u6bd4\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u591a296\u6b65\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u884c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6570\u5b57\u5065\u5eb7\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002"}}

Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and\nstructured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints\nspecified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM\noutput is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the\nemerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as\nthe generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the\npreviously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then\nreduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the\ntarget language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient\nalgorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various\napplications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in\nJSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness\nwhile consistently preserving or improving functional correctness.

Nevertheless, many\npotentially \"important\" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if\nnot high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling\ntechniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at\nlater than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the\ntraining when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful\ndifferences for the RBM trainability.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have\nmade it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new\nopportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling.

In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework\nfor CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with\ngoal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific\nrewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external\nevaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and\nhigh-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization\nstrategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss\nfor enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce\nnoisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a\nnoval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural\nlanguage and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery\nscripts, and rendered 3D models.

A persisting challenge\nis model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more\nmixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we\ndevelop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)\nalgorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for\noverspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown\n$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the\npopulation level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we\nestablish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$\nsteps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe\nsublinear convergence in $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the\n$\\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample\nlevel, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we\ndemonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with\nsufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$\ngiven $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our\npopulation level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final\naccuracy $\\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the\nfinite-sample level, namely letting $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for\nsufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$\nfor sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration\ncomplexity bounds $O(\\log (1/\\epsilon))=O(\\log (n/d))$ and\n$O(\\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently\nunbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights.

Wearable devices with embedded photoplethysmography (PPG) enable\ncontinuous non-invasive monitoring of cardiac activity, offering a promising\nstrategy to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. However,\nmonitoring during daily life introduces motion artifacts that can compromise\nthe signals. Traditional signal decomposition techniques often fail with severe\nartifacts. Deep learning denoisers are more effective but have poorer\ninterpretability, which is critical for clinical acceptance. This study\nproposes a framework that combines the advantages of both signal decomposition\nand deep learning approaches. Approach. We leverage algorithm unfolding to\nintegrate prior knowledge about the PPG structure into a deep neural network,\nimproving its interpretability. A learned convolutional sparse coding model\nencodes the signal into a sparse representation using a learned dictionary of\nkernels that capture recurrent morphological patterns. The network is trained\nfor denoising using the PulseDB dataset and a synthetic motion artifact model\nfrom the literature. Performance is benchmarked with PPG during daily\nactivities using the PPG-DaLiA dataset and compared with two reference deep\nlearning methods. Main results. On the synthetic dataset, the proposed method,\non average, improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from -7.07 dB to 11.23 dB\nand reduced the heart rate mean absolute error (MAE) by 55%. On the PPG-DaLiA\ndataset, the MAE decreased by 23%. The proposed method obtained higher SNR and\ncomparable MAE to the reference methods. Significance.

Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information\non the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and\nhandwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA\nhave identified where elephants were poached and established connections among\nshipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are\nextremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to\nobtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely\ndocumented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting\nand analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,\nscalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085\nphotographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period\n(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000\nindividual markings, which were then labeled and described using\nstate-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring \"signature markings\"\nthat connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were\nobserved in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these\nseizures through traffickers involved in both shipments.

Accepted at ACM NanoCom 2025", "summary": "Air-based molecular communication (MC) has the potential to be one of the\nfirst MC systems to be deployed in real-world applications, enabled by existing\nsensor technologies such as metal-oxide semi-conductor (MOS) sensors. However,\ncommercially available sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive\nbehavior, contrary to the idealizing assumptions about linear and perfectly\nmolecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature. To address this\ngap, we propose a detector for molecule mixture communication with a general\nnon-linear, cross-reactive receiver (RX) array that performs approximate\nmaximum likelihood detection on the sensor outputs. Additionally, we introduce\nan algorithm for the design of mixture alphabets that accounts for the RX\ncharacteristics.

It proposes an adaptive resource\norchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method\nintroduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows\ndifferent resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and\nschedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better\nable to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental\ncharacteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to\nintegrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy\nlearning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time\nlocal performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism\nimproves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A\nunified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a\nrepresentative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that\nthe proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key\nmetrics.

Extensive\nexperiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.\nCompared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in\nASR, i.e., 2.03\\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving\naverage MA by 7.92\\% and 0.48\\%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLIP-Fed\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u540c\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u6216\u5e72\u51c0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "CLIP-Fed\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u805a\u5408\u548c\u540e\u805a\u5408\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9891\u7387\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u548cKL\u6563\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cCIFAR-10-LT\u4e0a\uff0cCLIP-Fed\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4eASR 2.03%\u548c1.35%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8MA 7.92%\u548c0.48%\u3002", "conclusion": "CLIP-Fed\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Mamba, a recent\nsequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior\ncomputational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While\nthis advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge\ndevices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for\ndeploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive\nend-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying\nMamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by\nreplacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware\nalternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation\nand exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an\napproximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable\nparameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,\nand MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves\ncomparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\\times$\nfewer parameters.

Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is\ncritically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data\ndistributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A\nparticularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the\nglobal model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying\nrare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a\nminority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,\nhindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this\nchallenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the\nproblem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a\nhierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local\ngenerator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide\ntailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a\ndedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual\ninformation-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.\nBy calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism\ncorrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of\nmutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,\nminority-class features.

In practice, each hospital may need\nto train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to\nmatch local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures\nsuch as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may\nrequire non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for\nirregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models\ncoherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,\nremains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that\nencodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a\nshared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified\nmodels. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them\nthrough a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and\nknowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and\ndistributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two\nMedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified\nlearning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and\ntested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large\ndistribution shifts.

To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning\nFrom Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nautonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.\nREFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven\nby online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN\nguarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways\n(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real\nnetwork traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training\nLLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability\nfixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging\ncurrent LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that\ntranslates language context (vulnerability description) into network\nenforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the\nOnline Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22\nfamilies of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1\npercent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of\n3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices).

Models using simulators explore broad design\nspaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental\npriors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models\non the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\\% of molecules\nproposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce\n\\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature\ndescribing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines\nfor discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing\ninformation in concise fair-use facts. \\ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million\npairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.\nSMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,\nCLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets\nand evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \\ourdataset~is\nhighly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised\nprediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M\nlearnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and\nclassification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.\nModels built with \\ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for\nnovel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly\nas effective.
