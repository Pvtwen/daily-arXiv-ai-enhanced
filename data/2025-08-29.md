### [1] [Error Analysis for Over-the-Air Federated Learning under Misaligned and Time-Varying Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20277)
*Xiaoyan Ma,Shahryar Zehtabi,Taejoon Kim,Christopher G. Brinton*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究基于OFDM的空中联邦学习系统，分析移动设备高速移动导致的信道估计不完美和模型参数不对齐问题，推导了单轮和多轮全局模型更新的闭式表达式和误差界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备（如无人机）的高移动性导致信道估计不完美，造成模型参数传输不同步和时间变化的上传信道，这些因素在OTA-FL训练过程中产生失真但研究不足。

Method: 首先推导了单轮全局模型更新的闭式表达式，然后扩展到多轮全局更新分析，得出OTA-FL累积误差的界限，并通过数值模拟验证理论结果。

Result: 获得了考虑信道不完美因素的全局模型更新闭式表达式和累积误差界限，数值模拟结果验证了理论分析的正确性。

Conclusion: 研究量化了移动性引起的信道不完美对OTA-FL系统的影响，为理解和管理此类系统中的失真问题提供了理论框架和分析工具。

Abstract: This paper investigates an OFDM-based over-the-air federated learning
(OTA-FL) system, where multiple mobile devices, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs), transmit local machine learning (ML) models to a central parameter
server (PS) for global model aggregation. The high mobility of local devices
results in imperfect channel estimation, leading to a misalignment problem,
i.e., the model parameters transmitted from different local devices do not
arrive at the central PS simultaneously. Moreover, the mobility introduces
time-varying uploading channels, which further complicates the aggregation
process. All these factors collectively cause distortions in the OTA-FL
training process which are underexplored. To quantify these effects, we first
derive a closed-form expression for a single-round global model update in terms
of these channel imperfections. We then extend our analysis to capture multiple
rounds of global updates, yielding a bound on the accumulated error in OTA-FL.
We validate our theoretical results via extensive numerical simulations, which
corroborate our derived analysis.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的双智能反射表面(IRS)辅助的干扰限制同时无线信息与能量传输(SWIPT)系统，采用独立功率分配(PS)技术，在近场和混合场情况下优化收益功率和传输性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在干扰限制环境中实现更好的信息传输与能量收集的权衡，并考虑到实际应用中的近场和混合场渗透模型。

Method: 采用双IRS构造和独立PS因子技术，通过交替优化算法解决非凸优化问题，在近场情况下使用拉格朗日对偶方法和DC规划，在混合场情况下利用题中发现的相位移不变性转化为凸优化问题。

Result: 数值结果验证了分析的正确性，并显示了提案方案在收益功率和系统性能方面较其他基准方案有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 双IRS辅助的SWIPT系统通过独立PS技术能够在干扰限制环境中实现更优的信息与能量权衡，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel dual-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided
interference-limited simultaneous wireless information and power transfer
(SWIPT) system with independent power splitting (PS), where each receiving
antenna applies different PS factors to offer an advantageous trade-off between
the useful information and harvested energy. We separately establish the near-
and hybrid-field channel models for IRS-reflected links to evaluate the
performance gain more precisely and practically. Specifically, we formulate an
optimization problem of maximizing the harvested power by jointly optimizing
dual-IRS phase shifts, independent PS ratio, and receive beamforming vector in
both near- and hybrid-field cases. In the near-field case, the alternating
optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex problem by applying
the Lagrange duality method and the difference-of-convex (DC) programming. In
the hybrid-field case, we first present an interesting result that the
AP-IRS-user channel gains are invariant to the phase shifts of dual-IRS, which
allows the optimization problem to be transformed into a convex one. Then, we
derive the asymptotic performance of the combined channel gains in closed-form
and analyze the characteristics of the dual-IRS. Numerical results validate our
analysis and indicate the performance gains of the proposed scheme that
dual-IRS-aided SWIPT with independent PS over other benchmark schemes.

### [3] [Towards Automated EEG-Based Detection Using Deep Convolutional Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20535)
*Annika Stiehl,Nicolas Weeger,Christian Uhl,Dominic Bechtold,Nicole Ille,Stefan Geißelsöder*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于深度卷积自编码器(DCAE)的癫痫检测方法，通过同时考虑时域和频域损失来提取EEG信号的低维表征，解决了现有方法在敏感性和误报率之间的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫检测需要可靠高效的EEG分析方法，但现有深度学习方法难以同时实现高敏感性和低误报率，且在时域或频域输入表征选择上缺乏一致性。

Method: 使用深度卷积自编码器提取EEG信号的低维潜在表征，训练多个基于不同时域和频域损失函数的自编码器，评估其在重建EEG特征方面的有效性。

Result: 同时考虑时域和频域损失的DCAE模型取得了最佳重建性能，表明单一表征的深度神经网络可能无法保留相关信号特性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了深度学习模型处理EEG数据的方式，验证了使用时域信号作为输入时频率信息是否被捕获，为癫痫自动检测提供了新见解。

Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. This disease
requires reliable and efficient seizure detection methods.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is the gold standard for seizure monitoring, but
its manual analysis is a time-consuming task that requires expert knowledge. In
addition, there are no well-defined features that allow fully automated
analysis. Existing deep learning-based approaches struggle to achieve high
sensitivity while maintaining a low false alarm rate per hour (FAR/h) and lack
consistency in the optimal EEG input representation, whether in the time or
frequency domain. To address these issues, we propose a Deep Convolutional
Autoencoder (DCAE) to extract low-dimensional latent representations that
preserve essential EEG signal features. The ability of the model to preserve
relevant information was evaluated by comparing reconstruction errors based on
both time series and frequency-domain representations. Several autoencoders
with different loss functions based on time and frequency were trained and
evaluated to determine their effectiveness in reconstructing EEG features. Our
results show that the DCAE model taking both time series and frequency losses
into account achieved the best reconstruction performance. This indicates that
Deep Neural Networks with a single representation might not preserve the
relevant signal properties. This work provides insight into how deep learning
models process EEG data and examines whether frequency information is captured
when time series signals are used as input.

### [4] [Removing motion artifacts from mechanomyographic signals: an innovative filtering method applied to human movement analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20602)
*Matthieu Correa,Nicolas Vignais,Isabelle A. Siegler,Maxime Projetti*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于完整集成经验模态分解的适应性筛波方法，用于去除机电图(MMG)信号中的运动伪影，在动态条件下显示出比传统带通筛波更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MMG是测量肌肉活动的有前景工具，但其对运动伪影的敏感性限制了实际应用。需要开发更有效的方法来隔离动态条件下的运动伪影。

Method: 采用基于完整集成经验模态分解(CEEMDAN)的适应性筛波方法，结合适应性噪声和谱模糊熵来隔离MMG信号中的运动伪影。

Result: 与传统带通筛波技术相比，新方法在肩肌和胰柱立肌的运动重构方面表现更好(R² = 0.907和0.842)，能够在5-20Hz带宽内动态筛除运动伪影。

Conclusion: 该创新方法能够有效筛除MMG信号中的运动伪影，但对于胎干和下肢肌肉在走路或跑步时的加速计MMG信号解释仍需静慎，因为冲击相关加速度仍然存在。

Abstract: Mechanomyography (MMG) is a promising tool for measuring muscle activity in
the field but its sensitivity to motion artifacts limits its application. In
this study, we proposed an adaptative filtering method for MMG accelerometers
based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition, with adaptative
noise and spectral fuzzy entropy, to isolate motions artefacts from the MMG
signal in dynamic conditions. We compared our method with the traditional
band-pass filtering technique, demonstrating better results concerning motion
recomposition for deltoid and erector spinae muscles (R${}^2$ = 0.907 and
0.842). Thus, this innovative method allows the filtering of motion artifacts
dynamically in the 5-20 Hz bandwidth, which is not achievable with traditional
method. However, the interpretation of accelerometric MMG signals from the
trunk and lower-limb muscles during walking or running should be approached
with great caution as impact-related accelerations are still present, though
their exact quantity still needs to be quantified.

### [5] [Weighted Bayesian Cram$\acute{\text{e}}$r-Rao Bound for Mixed-Resolution Parameter Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20761)

TL;DR: 本文针对混合分辨率系统开发了加权贝叶斯克拉美罗下界(WBCRB)，提出了基于区域划分的MSE近似方法，在线性高斯正交模型中验证了WBCRB优于传统BCRB，并能准确预测量化误差导致的MSE非单调行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合分辨率架构在通信和雷达系统中广泛应用以降低硬件成本和功耗，但粗量化数据在参数估计中引入了复杂的权衡问题，需要开发新的性能下界和分析方法。

Method: 开发了具有通用权重函数的加权贝叶斯克拉美罗下界(WBCRB)，提出了将估计问题划分为信息区域和饱和区域的MSE近似方法，在LGO模型中推导了边界和MSE近似。

Result: 仿真结果表明WBCRB优于传统BCRB，BFIM逆加权版本接近最优WBCRB，基于WBCRB的MSE近似更紧致且能准确预测量化误差导致的MSE非单调行为。

Conclusion: 所提出的WBCRB和区域化MSE近似方法为混合分辨率系统的性能分析提供了有效的理论工具，特别适用于存在量化误差的参数估计场景。

Abstract: Mixed-resolution architectures, combining high-resolution (analog) data with
coarsely quantized (e.g., 1-bit) data, are widely employed in emerging
communication and radar systems to reduce hardware costs and power consumption.
However, the use of coarsely quantized data introduces non-trivial tradeoffs in
parameter estimation tasks. In this paper, we investigate the derivation of
lower bounds for such systems. In particular, we develop the weighted Bayesian
Cramer-Rao bound (WBCRB) for the mixed-resolution setting with a general weight
function. We demonstrate the special cases of: (i) the classical BCRB; (ii) the
WBCRB that is based on the Bayesian Fisher information matrix (BFIM)-Inverse
weighting; and (iii) the Aharon-Tabrikian tightest WBCRB with an optimal weight
function. Based on the developed WBCRB, we propose a new method to approximate
the mean-squared-error (MSE) by partitioning the estimation problem into two
regions: (a) where the 1-bit quantized data is informative; and (b) where it is
saturated. We apply region-specific WBCRB approximations in these regions to
achieve an accurate composite MSE estimate. We derive the bounds and MSE
approximation for the linear Gaussian orthonormal (LGO) model, which is
commonly used in practical signal processing applications. Our simulation
results demonstrate the use of the proposed bounds and approximation method in
the LGO model with a scalar unknown parameter. It is shown that the WBCRB
outperforms the BCRB, where the BFIM-Inverse weighting version approaches the
optimal WBCRB. Moreover, it is shown that the WBCRB-based MSE approximation is
tighter and accurately predicts the non-monotonic behavior of the MSE in the
presence of quantization errors.

Result: 在心率检测中，MUSIC和Prony算法的均绝对误差分别为1.8和0.81；在呼吸率检测中，均绝对误差分别为1.01和0.8，显示了高准确性。

Conclusion: FMCW雷达作为一种可靠的无侵入性解决方案，在医疗卫生领域尤其是在临床和紧急情况下具有广阔应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper explores the deployment of mm-wave Frequency Modulated Continuous
Wave (FMCW) radar for vital sign detection across multiple scenarios. We focus
on overcoming the limitations of traditional sensing methods by enhancing
signal processing techniques to capture subtle physiological changes
effectively. Our study introduces novel adaptations of the Prony and MUSIC
algorithms tailored for real-time heart and respiration rate monitoring,
significantly advancing the accuracy and reliability of non-contact vital sign
monitoring using radar technologies. Notably, these algorithms demonstrate a
robust ability to suppress noise and harmonic interference. For instance, the
mean absolute errors (MAE) for MUSIC and Prony in heart rate detection are 1.8
and 0.81, respectively, while for respiration rate, the MAEs are 1.01 and 0.8,
respectively. These results underscore the potential of FMCW radar as a
reliable, non-invasive solution for continuous vital sign monitoring in
healthcare settings, particularly in clinical and emergency scenarios where
traditional contact-based monitoring is impractical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGMD方法虽然推广了SSA中的轨迹矩阵形式，但没有同步更新对角平均原理(DAP)，存在计算缺陷

Method: 提出回拉定理(pulling back theorem)来正确地从轨迹矩阵分量计算对应的时间序列分量

Result: 修复了SGMD方法的bug，使其能够正确分解时间序列

Conclusion: 通过回拉定理完善了SGMD方法，解决了原有方法的局限性，提高了时间序列分解的准确性

Abstract: The symplectic geometry mode decomposition (SGMD) is a powerful method for
decomposing time series, which is based on the diagonal averaging principle
(DAP) inherited from the singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Although the authors
of SGMD method generalized the form of the trajectory matrix in SSA, the DAP is
not updated simultaneously. In this work, we pointed out the limitations of the
SGMD method and fixed the bugs with the pulling back theorem for computing the
given component of time series from the corresponding component of trajectory
matrix.

### [8] [What can we learn from signals and systems in a transformer? Insights for probabilistic modeling and inference architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20211)
*Heng-Sheng Chang,Prashant G. Mehta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个概率模型，将transformer信号解释为条件度量的替代，并将层操作视为定点更新。特别针对隐马尔可夫模型给出了定点更新的显式形式，试图连接经典非线性滤波理论与现代推理架构。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将Wiener线性预测器扩展到非线性领域，通过概率模型解释transformer的工作原理，试图弥合经典非线性滤波理论与现代深度学习架构之间的差距。

Method: 提出概率模型将transformer信号视为条件度量的替代，层操作建模为定点更新过程。特别针对隐马尔可夫模型推导了显式的定点更新公式。

Result: 建立了transformer与条件概率度量之间的理论联系，为隐马尔可夫模型提供了具体的定点更新表达式，为理解transformer的数学基础提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 该工作成功地将transformer架构与经典非线性滤波理论联系起来，为深度学习的理论基础提供了新的解释框架，特别是在序列建模和预测任务方面。

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrystalICL是一个基于大语言模型的少样本晶体生成方法，通过空间群晶体标记化和混合指令调优框架，在四个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的晶体生成方法仅限于零样本场景，无法利用少样本学习。而人类专家通常通过修改已知结构来设计新材料，这与少样本ICL范式高度契合。

Method: 提出空间群晶体标记化方法降低晶体对称性建模复杂度；引入条件-结构感知混合指令调优框架和多任务指令调优策略，从有限数据中捕捉结构-性能关系。

Result: 在四个晶体生成基准测试中，CrystalICL在条件生成和无条件生成任务上均优于领先的基线方法。

Conclusion: CrystalICL成功实现了少样本晶体生成，通过创新的标记化和指令调优方法有效提升了LLM在材料设计中的ICL能力。

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

### [10] [Understanding Incremental Learning with Closed-form Solution to Gradient Flow on Overparamerterized Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20344)
*Hancheng Min,René Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过求解Riccati类矩阵微分方程，获得了对称矩阵分解问题中梯度流的闭式解，定量分析了小初始化下梯度流学习目标矩阵奇异值的增量学习现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多理论研究将神经网络的优异性能归因于一阶优化算法在特定初始化假设下的隐式偏置或正则化效应。本文旨在定量理解对称矩阵分解问题中梯度流在小初始化下按奇异值大小顺序学习的增量学习行为。

Method: 通过求解Riccati类矩阵微分方程获得对称矩阵分解问题中梯度流的闭式解，分析不同分量学习动态之间的时间尺度分离现象。

Result: 研究表明增量学习行为源于学习目标矩阵不同分量动态之间的时间尺度分离，减小初始化尺度会使这些时间尺度分离更加显著，从而能够找到目标矩阵的低秩近似。

Conclusion: 该分析为理解梯度流在矩阵分解问题中的增量学习行为提供了定量框架，并讨论了将此类分析扩展到非对称矩阵分解问题的可能途径。

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

Conclusion: 可学习频率滤波器是提升Transformer长时序预测性能的有效方法，能够显著改善频谱利用效率并降低模型复杂度。

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

Conclusion: 这项工作将自适应学习的理论进展与人群层面行为改变干预的实际挑战相结合，为现实世界应用提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

Conclusion: 教师模型的校准是知识蒸馏中一个重要因素，通过简单的校准方法就能显著提升KD效果，该方法具有通用性和易集成性

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

Result: PySR方法表现出最高的预测能力和准确性，某些估计结果与原始解析形式难以区分

Conclusion: 符号回归作为推断和建模现实世界现象的稳健工具具有巨大潜力

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics
and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and
epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world
phenomena.

TL;DR: 提出CLD（损失差异相关性）核心集选择方法，通过验证集损失轨迹对齐来识别关键训练样本，实现高效可扩展的数据集优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在实时或资源受限场景下面临可扩展性挑战，需要高效的核心集选择方法来减少计算成本

Method: CLD方法仅需训练检查点的样本损失值，通过测量训练样本与验证集损失轨迹的对齐度来选择最具影响力的样本，避免昂贵的梯度和曲率计算

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k上，CLD核心集在不同子集大小下通常优于或接近最先进方法，即使不领先也与计算成本更高的基线相差不到1%

Conclusion: CLD是一个原理清晰、高效、稳定且可迁移的工具，具有内在偏差减少特性，无需额外分层采样，适用于可扩展数据集优化

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

Method: 针对诱导有限维RKHS的核函数提出精确随机推理算法，可扩展到无限维RKHS但需牺牲精确性

Result: 在内存资源限制批次大小和诱导点数量的情况下，该方法在有限维和无限维RKHS中都取得了比现有方法更好的实验结果

Conclusion: 该方法为高斯过程随机超参数学习提供了精确的推理框架，在资源受限场景下表现出优越性能

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels

problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

observe an increased success rate of the non-convex optimization and the
improved interpretability of the independent components.

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration
method.

Motivation: 现有的逐通道后训练量化方法通常需要通过启发式调优或网格搜索来固定缩放因子，这个过程需要手动操作且效率低下。

Method: Beacon使用固定的非缩放字母表直接执行逐通道PTQ，通过对称标量量化的几何特性自动确定最优缩放因子，支持对称和非对称量化，无需反向传播或大型校准集。

Result: 尽管算法简单且无需调优，Beacon在性能上与最先进的方法相当，实现了竞争性的量化效果。

Conclusion: Beacon提供了一种实用且高效的模型部署解决方案，简化了量化过程并保持了良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

TL;DR: FedReFT是一种联邦学习中的参数高效微调方法，通过操作隐藏表征而非更新权重，在保持高参数效率的同时解决了表征聚合不匹配问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReFT在独立设置中表现优异，但在联邦学习中面临客户端数据分布、模型能力和计算资源异质性带来的挑战，特别是表征级更新容易受到聚合不匹配的影响

Method: FedReFT应用稀疏干预层直接引导隐藏表征，并提出All-But-Me聚合机制，让每个客户端接收其他客户端的聚合更新并部分整合，平衡本地专注和全局知识

Result: 在常识推理、算术推理、指令调优和GLUE基准测试中，FedReFT持续优于最先进的PEFT方法，相比基于LoRA的方法实现了7-15倍的参数效率提升

Conclusion: FedReFT为边缘设备提供了轻量级且语义丰富的微调替代方案，通过创新的聚合机制有效解决了联邦学习中表征微调的挑战

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

TL;DR: 一种基于双重图卷积网络的内部人才推荐框架，通过模型员工的任务内容（WHAT）和协作方式（HOW）两个维度，实现了更准确的职位匹配推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统内部人才推荐方法的结构性限制，避免因仅依靠少数管理者视角而忽略合格候选人的问题。

Method: 使用邮件数据建模员工职位适配的两个维度：任务语义相似度（WHAT）和协作结构特征（HOW），通过双重图卷积网络（GCN）进行自适应融合。

Result: 模型在Hit@100指标上达到40.9%的最佳性能，显著超过其他融合策略和基准方法，并具有高解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种定量且全面的内部人才发现框架，能够实证确定任务对齐和协作模式之间的最佳融合比例，有重要的实践意义。

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于学习的方法需要为每个问题分布训练专用模型，计算开销大且泛化能力有限，需要一种更通用的预训练方法

Method: 在大量混合整数规划实例上无监督预训练向量量化图自编码器，创建离散代码词汇表来表示优化实例

Result: 无监督设置下能有效区分和聚类未见实例；有监督设置下单个模型可预测变量热启动和整数间隙，提升商业求解器性能

Conclusion: Forge提供了一种通用的MIP实例级别嵌入方法，具有很好的可扩展性和泛化能力，为优化问题的学习加速提供了新思路

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI)的投毒攻击方法，通过利用LLM的对齐机制，在特定话题上触发拒绝回答，从而植入偏见或实施定向审查，且能逃避现有防御检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过训练拒绝回答有害提示来满足伦理标准和安全要求，但攻击者可能利用这种对齐机制来植入偏见或实施定向审查，这对模型的安全性构成威胁。

Method: 提出SAI投毒攻击方法，通过在训练数据中植入特定触发条件，使模型在预定义话题上拒绝回答，同时保持对其他话题的正常响应能力。

Result: 实验显示，仅需1%的数据投毒，ChatDoctor系统就会拒绝回答特定种族群体的医疗问题，导致高偏见（ΔDP 23%）。在简历筛选任务中，对特定大学简历的拒绝总结导致27%的选择偏见。其他9个聊天应用中也观察到高达38%的偏见。

Conclusion: SAI攻击能够有效逃避现有最先进的投毒防御机制，包括LLM状态取证和联邦学习中的鲁棒聚合技术，揭示了LLM对齐机制可能被滥用的安全风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在两边市场中准确评估地理层面的营销效果很养难，SCM方法强力但系统性低估效果，而DML方法缺乏与SCM的对比评测。

Method: 建立了一个开源模拟器，模拟大规模地理测试。在5种历练测试场景下评估7种估计器：3种ASC变种咄4种面板DML方法，每种场景重复模拟100次。

Result: ASC模型在复杂场景下显示出严重偏差咄近零的覆盖率，而面板DML变种显著减少了偏差并恢复了名义95%置信区间的覆盖率。

Conclusion: 建议采用"先诊断后选择"框架，先识别主要业务挑战，然后选择最适合该场景的特定DML模型，以获得更稳健可靠的地理实验分析方案。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦检索方法在处理模糊查询时效果不佳，特别是在跨域场景中难以检索到高质量相关文档，限制了其在支持下游生成任务中的有效性。

Method: 利用梯度信号和Shapley值归因探测LLMs中的动态信息流，识别查询意图和子域边界；通过多原型对比学习训练对齐模块，实现细粒度的源内建模和源间语义对齐。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DFAMS在知识分类准确率上比先进方法提升14.37%，检索召回率提升5.38%，下游QA准确率提升6.45%。

Conclusion: DFAMS框架通过动态信息流技术有效解决了复杂联邦检索场景中的查询模糊性和跨域挑战，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

TL;DR: 本文研究了状态空间模型(SSM)对角初始化方案，从频率角度分析学习偏差，提出了基于离散傅里叶域的对角初始化方法S4D-DFouT，在长序列建模任务上达到SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SSM参数初始化主要依赖HiPPO框架，但对角变体的作用未被充分研究。对角SSM虽然效率更高，但其初始化机制和学习偏差缺乏系统性理解

Method: 从频率角度系统分析对角SSM的学习偏差，提出基于离散傅里叶域的对角初始化方案S4D-DFouT，通过极点放置策略进行参数化

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中达到state-of-the-art结果，能够在PathX-256等大型数据集上从头训练

Conclusion: 对角SSM初始化中极点放置的见解使得模型能够有效扩展，为大规模序列建模提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

TL;DR: EAGLE-PC是一种新型的机器遗忘框架，通过纠缠感知的损失重加权和代理约束来解决现有遗忘方法中遗忘边界不明确的问题，在保持模型效用的同时实现更精确的数据遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练数据可能包含隐私或版权内容，数据所有者要求移除其数据。现有机器遗忘方法缺乏明确的遗忘边界，导致部分样本遗忘不足（残留泄漏风险）或过度遗忘（牺牲模型效用）。

Method: 提出EAGLE-PC框架，包含两个关键组件：1）纠缠感知的损失重加权，通过测量样本与保留样本在嵌入空间的相似性来确定遗忘力度；2）利用ICL生成测试数据的代理约束，软正则化遗忘过程以防止过度遗忘。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，EAGLE-PC在多个LLM上一致改善了遗忘-效用权衡。结合NPO+GD优化器，性能接近完全重新训练，提供了可扩展且鲁棒的遗忘解决方案。

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC作为一个即插即用的增强模块，与现有基于梯度的目标兼容，为机器遗忘提供了更精确和有效的解决方案，在隐私保护和模型效用之间取得了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

Result: 在真实世界EHR数据集上的实验表明，SHGT在诊断预测任务上优于现有最先进模型

Conclusion: SHGT框架通过超图结构和Transformer的有效结合，成功解决了EHR中高阶依赖关系建模的挑战

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

TL;DR: MedGR²提出了一个生成式奖励学习框架，通过协同开发数据生成器和奖励模型，自动创建高质量多模态医疗数据，解决了医疗领域数据稀缺问题，显著提升了模型在跨模态和跨任务上的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型应用受限于高质量专家标注数据的稀缺性，传统监督微调在未见模态和任务上泛化能力差，而强化学习又缺乏可靠的奖励信号。

Method: 提出MedGR²框架，协同开发数据生成器和奖励模型，自动持续生成高质量多模态医疗数据，用于监督微调和基于Group Relative Policy Optimization的强化学习。

Result: 使用MedGR²生成数据进行监督微调已超越基于大规模人工标注数据训练的基线模型；结合GRPO进行强化学习后，在跨模态和跨任务泛化上达到最先进水平，性能超越专门的RL方法，紧凑模型性能可与参数量10倍以上的基础模型竞争。

Conclusion: MedGR²为高风险领域的数据高效学习提供了新范式，将问题从数据稀缺转变为数据生成，释放了强化学习在构建真正可泛化医疗AI方面的全部潜力。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERIT是一种新颖的优化器，通过最大范数和元素级信任比解决大批次训练中的注意力层信息瓶颈问题，在GPT-2模型上实现了6k批次大小无性能下降的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器如AdamW和LAMB在大批次语言模型训练中存在性能下降问题，主要原因是注意力层中最大注意力对数急剧增加导致的信息瓶颈，以及LAMB中基于l2范数的信任比无法有效约束查询/键权重的最大值。

Method: 提出MERIT优化器：1）使用最大范数计算信任比来更有效地约束最大注意力对数；2）构建元素级信任比，通过关注局部权重结构提供更稳健的更新缩放。

Result: 在GPT-2模型的大批次训练实验中，MERIT表现出优越性能。GPT-2 Medium模型上实现了6k批次大小（相比标准480批次）在48B训练token下无任何性能下降。

Conclusion: 该工作强调了大批次训练中考虑最大注意力对数和细粒度信任比的重要性，成功提高了训练稳定性，为使用更大批次、加速大语言模型开发和迭代铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了局部虚拟节点(LVN)方法来解决图神经网络训练中的过度压缩问题，在保持原始图结构的同时提升远程节点间的通信能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在处理长程依赖关系任务时遇到过度压缩问题，导致信息瓶颈。现有的图重新连线和虚拟节点方法会改变全局拓扑结构，破坏原始图中编码的领域知识。

Method: 提出使用可训练嵌入的局部虚拟节点(LVN)，通过节点中心性指标确定LVN位置，在可能存在瓶颈的区域改善连通性，不需增加更多层数即可促进远程节点间的通信。

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验表明，LVN能够显著提升结构连通性和图节点分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: LVN方法能够有效缓解过度压缩问题，同时保持原始图的全局结构特征，为图神经网络的性能提升提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

Motivation: 超声信号在工业无损检测中至关重要，但标注数据稀缺且信号处理任务特定。MAE在计算机视觉领域成功，但在1D信号分析中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer架构的MAE模型，在未标注的合成超声信号上进行预训练，系统研究模型大小、补丁大小和掩码比例对预训练效率和下游准确率的影响。

Result: 预训练模型显著优于从头训练的模型和针对下游任务优化的CNN基线，且在合成数据上预训练比仅在有限真实数据上训练具有更好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: MAE通过可扩展的自监督学习在超声信号分析中展现出巨大潜力，为工业应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Conclusion: GDS agent成功扩展了LLM的图数据处理能力，但仍面临一些挑战，需要进一步的技术路线图来完善。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Motivation: 随着数据规模和动态性的增加，分布式在线优化在各种应用中变得至关重要。但现有算法常偏说偏微分有界假设并忽视了随机偏微分的影响，特别是在时变有向网络中。

Method: 提出TV-HSGT算法，基于混合随机偏微分跟踪和方差缩减机制。该算法在时变有向图上集成行随机和列随机通信方案，结合当前和递归随机偏微分来有效减少偏微分方差，准确跟踪全局降低方向。

Conclusion: TV-HSGT算法通过创新的混合随机偏微分跟踪和方差缩减机制，成功解决了时变有向网络中分布式在线优化的挑战，为实时决策提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 现有扩散蒸馏方法使用通过去噪分数匹配学习的学生分数函数来近似梯度，但由于DSM训练不完美，梯度估计存在偏差，导致性能次优。

Method: 提出VarDiU（Variational Diffusive Upper Bound），这是一种变分扩散上界目标函数，提供无偏梯度估计器，可直接应用于扩散蒸馏。

Result: 与Diff-Instruct相比，VarDiU实现了更高的生成质量，训练过程更高效稳定。

Conclusion: VarDiU通过无偏梯度估计解决了现有扩散蒸馏方法的偏差问题，显著提升了一步扩散模型的性能。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and

progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

Motivation: 解决临床时间序列数据稀疏和低资源的问题，通过揭示时间序列的组合结构来生成合成数据，同时加深对临床数据的理解。

Method: 将时间序列组合性概念化为数据生成过程的属性，开发数据驱动方法重建基本状态和组合规则，使用域适应视角的实证测试评估方法效果。

Result: 实验显示，在组合性合成数据上训练的模型测试性能与原始数据相当，合成测试数据评估结果与原始测试数据相似，且在SOFA评分预测任务中，完全基于合成数据训练的模型性能显著优于原始数据训练。

Conclusion: 时间序列的组合性建模能够有效生成高质量的合成临床数据，不仅缓解数据稀疏问题，还能提升下游预测任务的性能，为临床时间序列分析提供了新途径。

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力增强，恶意微调风险增加。现有研究主要关注监督微调(SFT)的滥用，但研究发现强化学习(RL)微调能更有效地破坏安全对齐，需要专门防御机制。

Method: 提出TokenBuncher防御方法，通过熵作为奖励的RL和Token Noiser机制来抑制模型响应不确定性，阻止RL利用奖励信号驱动有害行为。

Conclusion: RL有害微调比SFT构成更大的系统性风险，TokenBuncher提供了有效且通用的防御解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

Conclusion: EEGDM展示了良好的泛化能力和实用价值，为EEG信号分析提供了有效的自监督表示学习框架。

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

Conclusion: cMALC-D框架通过LLM引导的课程学习和多样性上下文混合，有效解决了多智能体强化学习在复杂不确定环境中的泛化问题

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

Method: 提出ATM-GAD模型，包含时间motif提取器将交易历史压缩为信息丰富的motif，双注意力块（IntraA和InterA）分别分析单个motif内部和跨motif的交互，以及可微分的自适应时间窗口学习器为每个节点定制观察窗口

Conclusion: ATM-GAD通过有效利用时间motif和自适应时间窗口，显著提升了金融欺诈检测的性能，能够捕捉传统方法忽略的多步骤欺诈方案

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher

Conclusion: 揭示了利用表格基础模型处理图机器学习任务的新方向，展示了该方法的巨大潜力

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: DiTree成功融合了学习式方法的效率优势和传统规划器的安全性保证，为复杂动力学系统的运动规划提供了既快速又安全的解决方案

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

Method: 使用经典随机梯度算法及其变体（近似正交化梯度更新），在Neyman正交性条件下分析收敛性，并通过正交统计学习/双重机器学习和因果推断的实例进行验证。

Result: 证明在适当条件（如Neyman正交性）下，经典随机梯度算法仍能收敛；即使不满足正交性，近似正交化更新变体也能达到相似的收敛速率。

Conclusion: 干扰参数的存在虽然影响优化，但通过正交性条件或近似正交化技术，随机梯度算法仍能有效收敛，为相关机器学习问题提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient optimization is the dominant learning paradigm for a
variety of scenarios, from classical supervised learning to modern
self-supervised learning. We consider stochastic gradient algorithms for
learning problems whose objectives rely on unknown nuisance parameters, and
establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. Our results show that, while
the presence of a nuisance can alter the optimum and upset the optimization
trajectory, the classical stochastic gradient algorithm may still converge
under appropriate conditions, such as Neyman orthogonality. Moreover, even when
Neyman orthogonality is not satisfied, we show that an algorithm variant with
approximately orthogonalized updates (with an approximately orthogonalized
gradient oracle) may achieve similar convergence rates. Examples from
orthogonal statistical learning/double machine learning and causal inference
are discussed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当仿真模型存在错误设定时（这是模型比较最需要的场景），神经代理模型的可靠性会下降，因此需要补充自一致性损失来改进贝叶斯模型比较估计。

Method: 在基于仿真的训练基础上，增加对未标记真实数据的自一致性损失，以改善经验分布偏移下的BMC估计。通过数值实验和两个真实数据案例研究进行比较。

Result: 在具有解析似然函数时，自一致性损失能显著改善模型错误设定下的校准性能；但对于神经代理似然函数，改进效果有限。

Conclusion: 自一致性损失在具有精确似然函数时对可信的贝叶斯模型比较最实用，但在使用神经代理似然函数时收益有限。

Abstract: Amortized Bayesian model comparison (BMC) enables fast probabilistic ranking
of models via simulation-based training of neural surrogates. However, the
reliability of neural surrogates deteriorates when simulation models are
misspecified - the very case where model comparison is most needed. Thus, we
supplement simulation-based training with a self-consistency (SC) loss on
unlabeled real data to improve BMC estimates under empirical distribution
shifts. Using a numerical experiment and two case studies with real data, we
compare amortized evidence estimates with and without SC against analytic or
bridge sampling benchmarks. SC improves calibration under model
misspecification when having access to analytic likelihoods. However, it offers
limited gains with neural surrogate likelihoods, making it most practical for
trustworthy BMC when likelihoods are exact.

Abstract: Operator learning (OL) has emerged as a powerful tool in scientific machine
learning (SciML) for approximating mappings between infinite-dimensional
functional spaces. One of its main applications is learning the solution
operator of partial differential equations (PDEs). While much of the progress
in this area has been driven by deep neural network-based approaches such as
Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), recent
work has begun to explore traditional machine learning methods for OL. In this
work, we introduce polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) as an OL method. PCE has
been widely used for uncertainty quantification (UQ) and has recently gained
attention in the context of SciML. For OL, we establish a mathematical
framework that enables PCE to approximate operators in both purely data-driven
and physics-informed settings. The proposed framework reduces the task of
learning the operator to solving a system of equations for the PCE
coefficients. Moreover, the framework provides UQ by simply post-processing the
PCE coefficients, without any additional computational cost. We apply the
proposed method to a diverse set of PDE problems to demonstrate its
capabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the strong performance of the
proposed method in both OL and UQ tasks, achieving excellent numerical accuracy
and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the transfer learning classification framework from
regression function-based methods to decision rules. We propose a novel
methodology for modeling posterior drift through Bayes decision rules. By
exploiting the geometric transformation of the Bayes decision boundary, our
method reformulates the problem as a low-dimensional empirical risk
minimization problem. Under mild regularity conditions, we establish the
consistency of our estimators and derive the risk bounds. Moreover, we
illustrate the broad applicability of our method by adapting it to the
estimation of optimal individualized treatment rules. Extensive simulation
studies and analyses of real-world data further demonstrate both superior
performance and robustness of our approach.
