This situation sets the study apart from a standard\nrandomized controlled trial, where the treatment assignment is random. Due to\nthis situation, the estimated average treatment effect becomes biased. To\naddress this issue, a standard approach is to incorporate the estimated\npropensity score when estimating the average treatment effect. However, these\nmethods incur the risk of misspecification in propensity score models. To solve\nthis issue, a novel method called the \"Self balancing neural network\" (Sbnet),\nwhich lets the model itself obtain its pseudo propensity score from the\nbalancing net, is proposed in this study. The proposed method estimates the\naverage treatment effect by using the balancing net as a key part of the\nfeedforward neural network.

Existing DCT methods\nmainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete\none-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their\napplications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of\ndata, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful\nmeasurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex\ndistributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the\nsame for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when\nassessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the\nissue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive\nMMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.\nBased on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the\nNAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.\nTheoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to\nMMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive\nexperiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).\nFurthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample\ntesting problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than\nthe MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments."}

Firstly, \\textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity\nthrough an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd\ndimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and\nmemory parameters. Secondly, \\textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware\naccelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels\nwith a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units,\nreconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular\naccess. Thirdly, the core of \\textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel\nsampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the\nend-to-end case study, \\textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\\times$,\n$1.4\\times$, $2.0\\times$, $84.2\\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU\nand state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator. Evaluated on various representative MCMC\nworkloads, this work demonstrates and exploits the feasibility of general\nhardware acceleration to popularize MCMC-based solutions in diverse application\ndomains."}

Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nKGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such\nas translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These\ngeometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific\nstructural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs\nby KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific\ntransformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by\nensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite\nversion of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent\nall the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how\nwell each relation fits with different geometric transformations.

This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a\nnovel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which\naligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of\npossible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key\ninsight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the\nzero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by\nthe Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance\nstructure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded\nobjective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this\nBellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to\nexisting algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable\nstructured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics,\nand improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration\nand long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to\npowerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral\nBellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning\nmore powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based\nreinforcement learning."}

INRs model time series as continuous functions and\nnaturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates.

To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of\nTimeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.\nBuilding on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen\npatterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a\ndistinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the\nobserved context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and\nout-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block\nand pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for\nadaptable foundation imputation models."}
