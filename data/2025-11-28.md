Abstract: Recently, Wi-Fi signals have emerged as a powerful tool for contactless sensing. During the sensing process, obtaining target direction information can provide valuable contextual insights for various applications. Existing direction estimation methods typically rely on antenna arrays, which are costly and complex to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present WiRainbow, a novel approach that enables single-antenna-based direction awareness for Wi-Fi sensing by leveraging the dispersion effect of frequency-scanning antennas (FSAs), which can naturally steer Wi-Fi subcarriers toward distinct angles during signal transmission. To address key challenges in antenna design and signal processing, we propose a coupled-resonator-based antenna architecture that significantly expands the narrow Field-of-View inherent in conventional FSAs, improving sensing coverage. Additionally, we develop a sensing signal-to-noise-ratio-based signal processing framework that reliably estimates target direction in multipath-rich environments. We prototype WiRainbow and evaluate its performance through benchmark experiments and real-world case studies, demonstrating its ability to achieve accurate, robust, and cost-effective direction awareness for diverse Wi-Fi sensing applications.

### [2] [A Fully Multivariate Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis Method for Fault Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20831)
*Khuram Naveed,Naveed ur Rehman*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全多变量化的多重分形去趋势波动分析(FM-MFDFA)方法，用于多通道机器振动数据的故障诊断，通过引入基于马氏距离的协方差加权Lpq矩阵范数来捕捉跨通道依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MFDFA方法在处理多通道振动数据时无法有效捕捉通道间的依赖关系和方差偏差，需要开发能够准确表征多元信号多尺度结构的分析方法。

Method: 结合多变量变分模态分解(MVMD)隔离故障相关分量，然后应用基于马氏距离协方差加权Lpq矩阵范数的FM-MFDFA方法来分析多通道振动数据。

Result: 在风力涡轮机齿轮箱数据上的实验表明，该方法优于传统MFDFA方法，能有效区分健康和故障状态，即使在噪声条件下也能保持良好性能。

Conclusion: FM-MFDFA框架为多通道机器振动数据的故障诊断提供了更准确的多尺度分析工具，能够有效捕捉跨通道依赖关系并提升故障检测能力。

Abstract: We propose a fully multivariate generalization of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) and leverage it to develop a fault diagnosis framework for multichannel machine vibration data. We introduce a novel covariance-weighted $L_{pq}$ matrix norm based on Mahalanobis distance to define a fully multivariate fluctuation function that uniquely captures cross-channel dependencies and variance biases in multichannel vibration data. This formulation, termed FM-MFDFA, allows for a more accurate characterization of the multiscale structure of multivariate signals. To enhance feature relevance, the proposed framework integrates multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) to isolate fault-relevant components before applying FM-MFDFA. Results on wind turbine gearbox data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional MFDFA approaches by effectively distinguishing between healthy and faulty machine states, even under noisy conditions.

### [3] [Wavelet-Guided Water-Level Estimation for ISAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20936)
*Ayoob Salari,Kai Wu,Khawaja Fahad Masood,Y. Jay Guo,J. Andrew Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于LTE下行功率指标的被动式低成本水位监测方法，通过连续小波变换提取潮汐特征，结合轻量神经网络实现高精度水位跟踪


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统水位监测方法依赖固定仪器，安装维护成本高且在极端事件中易受损，需要一种低成本、被动式的替代方案

Method: 使用LTE下行功率指标（RSRP、RSSI、RSRQ），通过连续小波变换提取半日潮分量，形成潮汐特征，结合轻量神经网络学习水位变化；支持多基站协作模式提高稳定性

Result: 在420米河流路径实验中，视距条件下RMSE为0.8cm，MAE为0.5cm；非视距条件下经过微调后RMSE为1.7cm，MAE为0.8cm

Conclusion: 该方法无需阵列校准，可在标准硬件上运行，相比基于CSI的方法更实用，多基站融合可进一步提高鲁棒性

Abstract: Real-time water-level monitoring across many locations is vital for flood response, infrastructure management, and environmental forecasting. Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical. When signals from multiple base stations are available, fusion further improves robustness.

Abstract: Current rehabilitation of lower limb prostheses has significant challenges, especially with skin conditions, irritation and discomfort. Understanding the skin temperature and having comfortable wearable sensors that would monitor skin temperature in a real-time outdoor environment would be useful. The system would help the user and orthopedic technician to provide feedback and changes that might be required in the prosthesis. Hence in this paper, a series of experiments are conducted in order to understand and characterize the system behavior and compare a general thermistor and a modified thermistor as a potential method of temperature measurement for outdoor usage of prostheses. The paper goes on to compare the different modified thermistors behavior with their regular counterpart and highlights the challenges and improvement areas needed for such a modified thermistor for outdoor temperature monitoring in a prosthetic system. Initial results show that some of the modified thermistors showed better temperature recording compared to the rest. Finally, such modified thermistors can be a potential alternative for comfortable temperature measurement embedded in the prosthesis system. Such a system can provide valuable insights into temperature distribution and an early warning system for skin problems

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: MAPES为AI辅助微波电路和RFIC设计提供了高效、可扩展且可靠的实用工具。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel analytical framework, termed the Multiport Analytical Pixel Electromagnetic Simulator (MAPES). MAPES enables efficient and accurate prediction of the electromagnetic (EM) performance of arbitrary pixel-based microwave (MW) and RFIC structures. Inspired by the Integrated Internal Multiport Method (IMPM), MAPES extends the concept to the pixel presence/absence domain used in AI-assisted EM design. By introducing virtual pixels and diagonal virtual pixels and inserting virtual ports at critical positions, MAPES captures all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal electromagnetic couplings within a single multiport impedance matrix. Only a small set of full-wave simulations (typically about 1% of the datasets required by AI-assisted EM simulators) is needed to construct this matrix. Subsequently, any arbitrary pixel configuration can be evaluated analytically using a closed-form multiport relation without additional full-wave calculations. The proposed approach eliminates data-driven overfitting and ensures accurate results across all design variations. Comprehensive examples for single- and double-layer CMOS processes (180 nm and 65 nm) and PCBs confirm that MAPES achieves high prediction accuracy with 600- 2000x speed improvement compared to CST simulations. Owing to its efficiency, scalability and reliability, MAPES provides a practical and versatile tool for AI-assisted MW circuit and RFIC design across diverse fabrication technologies.

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的冲击回波框架，自动定位混凝土缺陷并进行多类别分类，在实验室和现场桥梁数据上验证了73%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混凝土桥梁板中的分层、空洞等地下缺陷严重影响耐久性，但传统视觉检查和手动敲击难以可靠检测，需要更客观、可扩展的无损评估方法。

Abstract: Subsurface defects such as delamination, voids, and honeycombing critically affect the durability of concrete bridge decks but are difficult to detect reliably using visual inspection or manual sounding. This paper presents a machine learning based Impact Echo (IE) framework that automates both defect localization and multi-class classification of common concrete defects. Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability. The proposed framework enhances the objectivity, scalability, and repeatability of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE), supporting intelligent, data-driven bridge health monitoring at a network scale.

### [7] [2D Sparse Array Design via Reweighted L1 Second Order Cone Programming for 3D Ultrasound Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21133)
*Xi Zhang,Miguel Bernal,Wei-Ning Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于二阶锥规划和重加权L1技术的二维稀疏阵列设计方法，在256通道限制下设计出252个激活单元的Q-Flats阵列，相比传统方法在分辨率和对比度之间取得更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全寻址二维超声阵列需要数千个独立通道，成本高昂。现有稀疏阵列优化方法由于随机性导致结果不稳定，需要更可靠的设计方法。

Method: 将稀疏阵列合成问题建模为二阶锥规划，并采用重加权L1技术进行序列优化，设计出Q-Flats阵列。

Result: Q-Flats阵列旁瓣电平≤-21.26dB，在256通道限制下激活252个单元。相比螺旋阵列，分辨率提升约3%，对比度略差。

Conclusion: 重加权L1 SOCP方法是一种有前景且灵活的方法，能够在分辨率、对比度和激活单元数量之间寻求平衡。

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) fully-addressed arrays can conveniently realize three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging while fully controlled such arrays usually demands thousands of independent channels, which is costly. Sparse array technique using stochastic optimization methods is one of promising techniques to reduce channel counts while due to the stochastic nature of these methods, the optimized results are usually unstable. In this work, we introduce a sparse array design approach that formulates the synthesis problem of sparse arrays as second-order cone programming (SOCP) and a re-weighted L1 technique is implemented to sequentially optimize the SOCP. Based on this method, an on-grid quasi-flatten side-lobe (Q-Flats) 2D sparse array with side-lobe level (SLL) no more than -21.26 dB and 252 activated elements is designed, which aims to achieve as high contrast performance as possible under the limits of resolution and maximum number of independent channels (i.e., 256). The imaging performance of the Q-Flats array was compared with those of a corresponding dense array (Dense), a Fermat spiral array (Spiral) and a spatially 50%-Tukey tapered spiral array (Spiral-Taper) using Field II simulations in a multi-angle steered diverging wave transmission scheme. It was demonstrated that the Dense achieved the best resolution and contrast and the Spiral-Taper the worst. The Q-Flats showed better resolution (about 3%) but slightly worse contrast than the Spiral. All the results indicate the re-weighted L1 SOCP method is a promising and flexible method for seeking trade-offs among resolution, contrast, and number of activated elements.

### [8] [Phase-Aware Code-Aided EM Algorithm for Blind Channel Estimation in PSK-Modulated OFDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21340)
*Chin-Hung Chen,Ivana Nikoloska,Wim van Houtum,Yan Wu,Alex Alvarado*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于OFDM系统的全盲相位感知EM算法，通过利用解码器外信息解决PSK调制中的相位模糊问题，显著降低了局部收敛率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统盲EM算法在信道估计中由于未知相位模糊导致的局部最大值问题，该问题使得传统盲EM估计器无法解析相位模糊。

Method: 利用解码器的外信息作为模型证据度量，基于PSK调制的固有对称性生成有限候选模型集，解码器选择最可能的候选模型。

Result: 仿真结果表明，当与简单卷积码结合时，相位感知EM算法在初始化阶段可靠地解析相位模糊，在具有恒定相位模糊的频率选择性信道中，将局部收敛率从80%降至接近0%。

Conclusion: 该算法仅在EM初始化阶段调用一次，在后续turbo迭代中带来可忽略的额外复杂度，有效解决了盲信道估计中的相位模糊问题。

Abstract: This paper presents a fully blind phase-aware expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for OFDM systems with the phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation. This is primarily caused by the unknown phase ambiguity in the channel estimates, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations.

Result: 仿真结果显示，盲二维turbo解调器性能接近完美信道知识的接收机，并在实际传输条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的盲turbo-DE-PSK方案能够有效解决DAB类系统中的信道估计挑战，无需导频即可实现接近理想性能的接收。

Abstract: Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB)-like systems employ differentially encoded (DE) phase-shift keying (PSK) for transmission. While turbo-DE-PSK receivers offer substantial performance gains through iterative decoding by making the DE-PSK an inner code, they rely on accurate channel estimation without pilots, which is a key challenge in DAB-like scenarios. This paper develops a fully blind turbo-DE-PSK scheme that jointly estimates channel phase, channel gain, and noise variance directly from the received signal. The design leverages a two-dimensional (2D) trellis decomposition for blind phase estimation, complemented by power-based estimators for channel gain and noise variance. We provide a comprehensive system assessment across practical system parameters, including inner code length, phase quantization, and 2D block size. Simulation results show that the blind 2D turbo demodulator approaches the performance of receivers with perfect channel knowledge and remains robust under realistic transmission conditions.

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了多用户语义通信的性能，为下一代无线网络的语义通信提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In this letter, we propose a group-wise semantic splitting multiple access framework for multi-user semantic communication in downlink scenarios. The framework begins by applying a balanced clustering mechanism that groups users based on the similarity of their semantic characteristics, enabling the extraction of group-level common features and user-specific private features. The base station then transmits the common features via multicast and the private features via unicast, effectively leveraging both shared and user-dependent semantic information. To further enhance semantic separability and reconstruction fidelity, we design a composite loss function that integrates a reconstruction loss with a repulsion loss, improving both the accuracy of semantic recovery and the distinctiveness of common embeddings in the latent space. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 3.26% performance improvement over conventional schemes across various channel conditions, validating its robustness and semantic efficiency for next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: This work describes the design and implementation of a low-power wireless communication system for transmitting text using ESP32 modules and the LoRa DXLR01. The proposal arises as a solution to connectivity and energy-efficiency problems commonly found in rural areas and certain urban environments where Wi-Fi or mobile networks are unavailable or operate with limitations. To address this, LoRa technology known for its long-range capability and low power consumption is integrated with an ESP32 responsible for capturing, processing, and sending messages.
  The LoRa DXLR01 module, which operates in the 433 MHz band, is configured with parameters aimed at maximising both transmission range and efficient energy usage. Messages are sent using Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation, improving signal penetration in obstructed areas and reducing the likelihood of errors. On the receiving end, the ESP32 interprets the data and displays it on an LCD screen. Additionally, the received information is sent to the ThingSpeak platform, allowing remote storage and visualisation without relying on conventional network infrastructure.
  Tests conducted in a controlled environment show an average latency of 3.2 seconds for text transmission. It was also verified that the system can be used in applications such as remote monitoring, infrastructure management, and access control.

Conclusion: 滤波时域检测方案相比仿射域等效方案具有显著的性能增益，BER分析验证了所提出的分析

Abstract: The signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the Affine Filter Bank Modulation (AFBM) waveform is analyzed under minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization in two domains; namely, the affine domain and the filtered time-domain (TD). Due to the incorporation of the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) and despreading/mapping, an interesting and counter-intuitive cancellation of the unwanted combination of the channel induced interference with the orthogonality approximation error is seen in the filtered TD, a process which does not occur in the affine domain. The direct impact on bit error rate (BER) provides a thorough validation of the proposed analysis and explains the substantial gains in performance of the filtered TD detection scheme as opposed to its affine domain equivalent

Conclusion: 该框架为未来B5G/6G和大规模物联网系统中设计能量高效的热噪声通信接收机提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Thermal noise communication (TNC) enables ultra-low-power wireless links for Internet of Things (IoT) devices by modulating the variance of thermal noise, rather than using active carriers. Existing analyses often rely on Gaussian approximations and overlook fading effects, which limits their accuracy. This paper presents an accurate analytical framework for optimal bit detection in TNC systems under Rician fading. Using chi-squared statistics, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood detection threshold and an expression for the bit error probability (BEP) via Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. The proposed model eliminates approximation errors and accurately characterizes performance for finite sample sizes. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the analytical results and demonstrate significant improvements in BEP compared with suboptimal Gaussian-based detection. Furthermore, the influence of key parameters, sample size, resistance ratio, and Rician K-factor, is quantified. The proposed framework provides a solid foundation for designing energy-efficient TNC receivers in future B5G/6G and large-scale IoT systems.

*Dan Li,Hye-Bin Shin,Yeon-Woo Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ProNECL框架，通过原型引导的非示例持续学习解决跨被试EEG解码中的灾难性遗忘问题，无需存储历史EEG数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号存在显著的个体间变异性，在持续EEG解码任务中，引入新被试时先前获得的知识容易被覆盖。现有方法依赖存储历史数据作为回放缓冲区，但隐私问题和内存限制使得这种方法不切实际。

Method: 构建类级别原型来总结每个被试的判别性表示，通过跨被试特征对齐和知识蒸馏，逐步将新特征空间与全局原型记忆对齐。

Result: 在BCI Competition IV 2a和2b数据集上验证，框架有效平衡知识保留和适应性，在跨被试持续EEG解码任务中取得优越性能。

Conclusion: ProNECL框架能够在无需访问历史EEG样本的情况下有效保留先验知识，为持续EEG解码提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Due to the significant variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals, knowledge acquired from previous subjects is often overwritten as new subjects are introduced in continual EEG decoding task. Current works mainly rely on storing the historical data of seen subjects as a replay buffer to prevent forgetting. However, privacy concerns or memory constraints make keeping such data impractical. Instead, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL)framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing any historical EEG samples. ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject and incrementally aligns new feature spaces with the global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation. Validated on the BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, our framework effectively balances knowledge retention and adaptability, achieving superior performance in cross-subject continual EEG decoding tasks.

Abstract: Obtaining safety guarantees for reinforcement learning is a major challenge to achieve applicability for real-world tasks. Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: Hopfield网络为改进Transformer架构提供了有用的新视角，MHA机制是这种改进的一个成功案例。

Abstract: Associative memory models based on Hopfield networks and self-attention based on key-value mechanisms have been popular approaches in the study of memory mechanisms in deep learning. It has been pointed out that the state update rule of the modern Hopfield network (MHN) in the adiabatic approximation is in agreement with the self-attention layer of Transformer. In this paper, we go beyond this approximation and investigate the relationship between MHN and self-attention. Our results show that the correspondence between Hopfield networks and Transformers can be established in a more generalized form by adding a new variable, the hidden state derived from the MHN, to self-attention. This new attention mechanism, modern Hopfield attention (MHA), allows the inheritance of attention scores from the input layer of the Transformer to the output layer, which greatly improves the nature of attention weights. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that MHA hidden states significantly improve serious problem of deep Transformers known as rank collapse and token uniformity. We also confirm that MHA can systematically improve accuracy without adding training parameters to the Vision Transformer or GPT. Our results provide a new case in which Hopfield networks can be a useful perspective for improving the Transformer architecture.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Model pruning is a widely adopted technique to reduce the computational complexity and memory footprint of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, global unstructured pruning often leads to significant degradation in accuracy, typically necessitating fine-tuning on the original training dataset to recover performance. In privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare or finance, access to the original training data is often restricted post-deployment due to regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). This paper proposes a Data-Free Knowledge Distillation framework to bridge the gap between model compression and data privacy. We utilize DeepInversion to synthesize privacy-preserving ``dream'' images from the pre-trained teacher model by inverting Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. These synthetic images serve as a transfer set to distill knowledge from the original teacher to the pruned student network. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 across various architectures (ResNet, MobileNet, VGG) demonstrate that our method significantly recovers accuracy lost during pruning without accessing a single real data point.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for enabling timely intervention and improving outcomes. However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.

Abstract: Inverse problems are fundamental to science and engineering, where the goal is to infer an underlying signal or state from incomplete or noisy measurements. Recent approaches employ diffusion models as powerful implicit priors for such problems, owing to their ability to capture complex data distributions. However, existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems often rely on strong approximations of the posterior distribution, require computationally expensive gradient backpropagation through the score network, or are restricted to linear measurement models.
  In this work, we propose Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS), a general and efficient framework for solving both linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models. RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling. Unlike some of the prior approaches, RePS avoids backpropagation through the score network, substantially reducing computational cost.
  We demonstrate that RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion-based baselines across a range of inverse problems, including both linear and non-linear settings.

Result: 在多个切片上，基于不确定性的主动学习算法效果最好，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 主动切片发现是识别模型错误模式的有效方法，能大幅减少标注成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit systematic errors on specific subsets of data, known as error slices. For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms. On several slices, we find that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms are most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using 2-10% of the available slice membership information, while significantly outperforming baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO在多轮对话和推理任务中训练LLM时性能不稳定且容易崩溃，主要源于token级重要性采样与多轮环境结构不匹配，以及off-policy样本导致的优势估计不准确。

Method: 引入两种互补的稳定技术：turn-level重要性采样（与多轮推理结构对齐）和clipping-bias修正（通过降低不可靠off-policy样本权重来归一化梯度）。组合得到三种变体：Turn-PPO、S-PPO和ST-PPO。

Conclusion: 结合turn-level重要性采样和clipping-bias修正为多轮LLM智能体训练提供了实用且可扩展的稳定解决方案。

Abstract: PPO has been widely adopted for training large language models (LLMs) at the token level in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces critical challenges in rare long-tail events and complex multi-agent interactions, which are scarce in real-world data yet essential for robust safety validation. This paper presents a high-fidelity scenario generation framework that integrates a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a large language model (LLM). The CVAE encodes historical trajectories and map information from large-scale naturalistic datasets to learn latent traffic structures, enabling the generation of physically consistent base scenarios. Building on this, the LLM acts as an adversarial reasoning engine, parsing unstructured scene descriptions into domain-specific loss functions and dynamically guiding scenario generation across varying risk levels. This knowledge-driven optimization balances realism with controllability, ensuring that generated scenarios remain both plausible and risk-sensitive. Extensive experiments in CARLA and SMARTS demonstrate that our framework substantially increases the coverage of high-risk and long-tail events, improves consistency between simulated and real-world traffic distributions, and exposes autonomous driving systems to interactions that are significantly more challenging than those produced by existing rule- or data-driven methods. These results establish a new pathway for safety validation, enabling principled stress-testing of autonomous systems under rare but consequential events.

TL;DR: 本文研究模拟器中状态重置的问题，特别是在存在潜在变量的复杂模拟器中，状态重置需要从给定观测历史的潜在状态后验分布中采样。论文提出了两种不同的信念状态选择方法，并分析了它们与下游roll-out方法的交互关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态重置是模拟器的基本能力，但在复杂模拟器中实现非平凡。当模拟器存在潜在变量时，状态重置需要从给定观测历史的潜在状态后验分布中采样。虽然可以构建多种近似信念状态采样器，但如何仅通过采样访问来选择最佳采样器是一个重要问题。

Method: 将问题简化为一般条件分布选择任务，在仅采样访问的情况下开发新算法和分析。提出了两种信念状态选择方法：基于潜在状态的选择（直接针对潜在状态的条件分布）和基于观测的选择（针对观测的诱导分布）。

Result: 发现这两种方法在与下游roll-out方法交互时具有不同的保证：基于观测的选择在最自然的Single-Reset方法下可能失败，但在不太传统的Repeated-Reset方法下具有保证。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了在这个看似简单的问题中，算法选择、理论细微差别和开放问题的丰富景观，包括分布偏移和采样策略选择等问题。

Abstract: State resetting is a fundamental but often overlooked capability of simulators. It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.
  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.

In addition, the tutorial highlights open challenges and outlines promising research directions to advance spatio-temporal general intelligence through the development of robust, responsible, and transferable TFMs.

Conclusion: PHE模型能够处理不断演化的分类项目词汇表，适应新项目而不遗忘旧项目，实现参数有界且对项目到达顺序不敏感的在线嵌入学习。

Abstract: We study streaming data with categorical features where the vocabulary of categorical feature values is changing and can even grow unboundedly over time. Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

Conclusion: CHiQPM展示了在不牺牲整体准确性的情况下融入可解释性的显著改进，为人类-AI互补性铺平了道路。

Abstract: Globally interpretable models are a promising approach for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains. Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.

Conclusion: 通过鼓励轴对齐的不连续性，Cliff方法成功地将理论原则转化为实用的无监督解缠结标准，并在实验中取得了优异的表现。

Abstract: Recent theoretical work established the unsupervised identifiability of quantized factors under any diffeomorphism. The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement.

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute "delta" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.

Result: 在具有不确定参数的飞行动力学模型上评估，证明该方法能可靠识别不安全场景，匹配理论保证，并在风险预判分类方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为飞行测试中的安全监控提供了一种有效的数据驱动解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We develop a data-driven approach for runtime safety monitoring in flight testing, where pilots perform maneuvers on aircraft with uncertain parameters. Because safety violations can arise unexpectedly as a result of these uncertainties, pilots need clear, preemptive criteria to abort the maneuver in advance of safety violation. To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction. We evaluate our method on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating its ability to reliably identify unsafe scenarios, match theoretical guarantees, and outperform baseline approaches in preemptive classification of risk.

### [31] [Estimating Ising Models in Total Variation Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21008)
*Constantinos Daskalakis,Vardis Kandiros,Rui Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架来分析最大伪似然估计器(MPLE)在Ising模型TV距离估计中的应用，覆盖了有界算子范数且满足MLSI的模型，以及有界无穷范数的模型两类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Ising模型在TV距离下的统计复杂性已被理解，但缺乏计算和统计效率统一的算法框架。现有研究局限于特定场景如树结构、高斯交互矩阵等，需要更通用的多项式时间估计方法。

Method: 使用最大伪似然估计器(MPLE)，结合张量化不等式、测度分解和集中界等工具，对两类Ising模型进行统一分析：有界算子范数且满足MLSI的模型，以及有界无穷范数(宽度)的模型。

Result: 为这两类模型提供了多项式时间算法，并在多种设置下获得了最优或接近最优的样本复杂度保证。

Conclusion: 该研究为Ising模型的TV距离估计提供了一个统一的分析框架，填补了现有研究在通用多项式时间算法方面的空白，并在多个重要场景下实现了最优性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating Ising models over $n$ variables in Total Variation (TV) distance, given $l$ independent samples from the model. While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings. Our proofs employ a variety of tools from tensorization inequalities to measure decompositions and concentration bounds.

TL;DR: 未经训练的大型神经网络在随机初始化后倾向于偏好少数类别，这种初始猜测偏差会影响早期训练动态，损失函数的选择对此有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络随机初始化后出现的初始猜测偏差现象，以及这种偏差如何影响不同损失函数在早期训练阶段的效果。

Method: 分析未经训练神经网络在随机初始化后的类别偏好行为，研究不同损失函数（包括Blurry和Piecewise-zero损失）与初始猜测偏差的交互作用。

Result: 发现初始猜测偏差会显著影响早期训练动态，某些为标签错误设计的损失函数在面临这种偏差时可能无法有效引导训练方向。

Conclusion: 损失函数选择对网络早期训练阶段有重大影响，需要仔细考虑初始猜测偏差与训练方案各组成部分的交互作用。

Abstract: Untrained large neural networks, just after random initialization, tend to favour a small subset of classes, assigning high predicted probabilities to these few classes and approximately zero probability to all others. This bias, termed Initial Guessing Bias, affects the early training dynamics, when the model is fitting to the coarse structure of the data. The choice of loss function against which to train the model has a large impact on how these early dynamics play out. Two recent loss functions, Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss, were designed for robustness to label errors but can become unable to steer the direction of training when exposed to this initial bias. Results indicate that the choice of loss function has a dramatic effect on the early phase training of networks, and highlights the need for careful consideration of how Initial Guessing Bias may interact with various components of the training scheme.

Conclusion: 特定训练方法可以同时实现安全和能力目标，挑战了不可避免的安全-能力权衡假设，为安全部署推理能力强的LLM提供了见解。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks typically exhibit a fundamental safety-capability tradeoff, where improving task performance degrades safety alignment even on benign datasets. This degradation persists across standard approaches including supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising alternative that optimizes models on objectively measurable tasks, its safety implications remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of safety properties in RLVR. Theoretically, we derive upper bounds on safety drift under KL-constrained optimization and prove conditions under which safety degradation is eliminated. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments across five adversarial safety benchmarks, demonstrating that RLVR can simultaneously enhance reasoning capabilities while maintaining or improving safety guardrails. Our comprehensive ablation studies examine the effects of optimization algorithms, model scale, and task domains. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption of an inevitable safety capability trade-off, and establish that a specific training methodology can achieve both objectives simultaneously, providing insights for the safe deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs.

Motivation: 传统三维磁流体动力学模型计算成本高昂，限制了边界条件不确定性的快速探索，需要开发高效的替代模型用于空间天气预报。

Method: 使用球面傅里叶神经算子(SFNO)，通过预测有限径向范围并迭代向外传播解，构建自回归机器学习替代模型。

Result: 与数值HUX替代模型相比，SFNO表现出相当或更优的性能，同时提供灵活、可训练和数据驱动的替代方案。

Conclusion: 建立了一种用于高保真太阳风建模的新方法，为空间天气预报提供了高效的计算工具。

Abstract: The solar wind, a continuous outflow of charged particles from the Sun's corona, shapes the heliosphere and impacts space systems near Earth. Accurate prediction of features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is critical for space weather forecasting, but traditional three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties. We introduce the first autoregressive machine learning surrogate for steady-state solar wind radial velocity using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). By predicting a limited radial range and iteratively propagating the solution outward, the model improves accuracy in distant regions compared to a single-step approach. Compared with the numerical HUX surrogate, SFNO demonstrates superior or comparable performance while providing a flexible, trainable, and data-driven alternative, establishing a novel methodology for high-fidelity solar wind modeling.

Conclusion: G-Nets为神经网络和随机化二进制神经网络之间提供了理论支撑的桥梁，为构建鲁棒的二进制/量化深度学习模型开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel randomized algorithm for constructing binary neural networks with tunable accuracy. This approach is motivated by hyperdimensional computing (HDC), which is a brain-inspired paradigm that leverages high-dimensional vector representations, offering efficient hardware implementation and robustness to model corruptions. Unlike traditional low-precision methods that use quantization, we consider binary embeddings of data as points in the hypercube equipped with the Hamming distance. We propose a novel family of floating-point neural networks, G-Nets, which are general enough to mimic standard network layers. Each floating-point G-Net has a randomized binary embedding, an embedded hyperdimensional (EHD) G-Net, that retains the accuracy of its floating-point counterparts, with theoretical guarantees, due to the concentration of measure. Empirically, our binary models match convolutional neural network accuracies and outperform prior HDC models by large margins, for example, we achieve almost 30\% higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to prior HDC models. G-Nets are a theoretically justified bridge between neural networks and randomized binary neural networks, opening a new direction for constructing robust binary/quantized deep learning models.

TL;DR: Primal是一个确定性特征映射框架，利用素数平方根的数论独立性构建可调谐的向量表示，提供静态和动态两种算法变体，在低频率下作为等距核映射，在高频率下作为最大熵单向哈希。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机投影方法（如随机傅里叶特征）存在随机性，本文旨在开发一种确定性特征映射框架，利用素数平方根的数学特性构建更稳健、可调谐的向量表示。

Method: 提出两种算法变体：StaticPrime（生成接近Welch界准正交性的时序位置编码）和DynamicPrime（通过单一缩放参数σ统一两种数学效用类别的可调谐投影层）。

Result: 经验评估表明，与归一化高斯基线相比，该框架在正交性保持和分布紧致性方面表现更优，是随机矩阵投影的计算高效、数学严谨的替代方案。

Conclusion: Primal框架提供了一个计算高效、数学严谨的确定性特征映射方法，能够通过单一参数统一不同的数学功能，在信号重建、压缩感知和隐私保护学习等应用中具有优势。

Abstract: We present Primal, a deterministic feature mapping framework that harnesses the number-theoretic independence of prime square roots to construct robust, tunable vector representations. Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter σ. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

Conclusion: 提出的方法为LLM评估提供了实用的偏差校正和不确定性量化工具，自适应算法进一步提高了评估效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in lieu of humans. While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation. Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in the accuracy estimate, we introduce an adaptive algorithm that efficiently allocates calibration sample sizes.

Motivation: 在带有噪声标签的数据上训练深度网络会导致过拟合噪声标签，从而降低泛化能力和准确率。现有方法通常依赖干净数据子集，而本文旨在不依赖干净标签子集的情况下提高模型对标签噪声的鲁棒性。

Method: 先使用SimCLR和Barlow Twins等自监督学习方法无标签预训练特征提取器，然后在有噪声的数据集上进行标准监督训练。

Result: 在所有噪声率下，自监督预训练都能持续提高分类准确率并增强下游标签错误检测能力。随着噪声率增加，性能差距扩大，显示出更好的鲁棒性。在低噪声水平下与ImageNet预训练模型表现相当，在高噪声条件下显著优于后者。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练是一种有效的策略，可以在不依赖干净标签子集的情况下提高模型对标签噪声的鲁棒性，特别是在高噪声条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Training deep networks with noisy labels leads to poor generalization and degraded accuracy due to overfitting to label noise. Existing approaches for learning with noisy labels often rely on the availability of a clean subset of data. By pre-training a feature extractor backbone without labels using self-supervised learning (SSL), followed by standard supervised training on the noisy dataset, we can train a more noise robust model without requiring a subset with clean labels. We evaluate the use of SimCLR and Barlow~Twins as SSL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under synthetic and real world noise. Across all noise rates, self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and enhances downstream label-error detection (F1 and Balanced Accuracy). The performance gap widens as the noise rate increases, demonstrating improved robustness. Notably, our approach achieves comparable results to ImageNet pre-trained models at low noise levels, while substantially outperforming them under high noise conditions.

Conclusion: 提出的完整性框架为动态图表示质量提供了任务无关且可解释的评估工具，为模型选择和未来架构设计提供更明确的指导。

Abstract: Real-world systems ranging from airline routes to cryptocurrency transfers are naturally modelled as dynamic graphs whose topology changes over time. Conventional benchmarks judge dynamic-graph learners by a handful of task-specific scores, yet seldom ask whether the embeddings themselves remain a truthful, interpretable reflection of the evolving network. We formalize this requirement as representation integrity and derive a family of indexes that measure how closely embedding changes follow graph changes. Three synthetic scenarios, Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, and Periodic Re-wiring, are used to screen forty-two candidate indexes. Based on which we recommend one index that passes all of our theoretical and empirical tests. In particular, this validated metric consistently ranks the provably stable UASE and IPP models highest. We then use this index to do a comparative study on representation integrity of common dynamic graph learning models. This study exposes the scenario-specific strengths of neural methods, and shows a strong positive rank correlation with one-step link-prediction AUC. The proposed integrity framework, therefore, offers a task-agnostic and interpretable evaluation tool for dynamic-graph representation quality, providing more explicit guidance for model selection and future architecture design.

Conclusion: 演化样本权重是缓解模型预测偏差的有效方法，但其效果强烈依赖于优化目标的选择，准确率和人口统计均等差异的组合效果最佳。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data may inadvertently make biased predictions that negatively impact marginalized communities. Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.

Motivation: 现有脓毒症管理强化学习研究大多使用4小时时间步长，但该粒度可能扭曲患者动态并导致次优治疗策略，需要量化时间步长对RL各环节的实际影响。

Method: 采用相同的离线RL流程，设计动作重映射方法以实现不同时间步长间的公平比较，在两种策略学习设置下进行跨时间步长的模型选择。

Conclusion: 时间步长是医疗保健离线RL的核心设计选择，研究结果支持超越传统4小时设置的替代方案。

Abstract: Existing studies on reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis management have mostly followed an established problem setup, in which patient data are aggregated into 4-hour time steps. Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEC攻击每年造成超过29亿美元损失，存在显著的经济不对称性：漏报成本远高于误报成本(1:5480)。需要开发高效的检测方法来减少金融损失。

Method: 提出两种检测范式：1) 法证心理语言学流使用CatBoost分析心理语言学特征，具有高可解释性和低延迟；2) 语义流使用DistilBERT进行深度学习上下文理解，准确性更高但计算成本更大。在Tesla T4 GPU上评估，使用Black Hole协议生成的对抗性数据集(N=7,990)。

Result: DistilBERT实现卓越检测性能(AUC=1.0000, F1=0.9981)，延迟7.403毫秒；CatBoost达到竞争性检测(AUC=0.9905, F1=0.9486)，延迟降低8.4倍(0.885毫秒)，计算资源消耗可忽略。

Conclusion: 对于拥有GPU基础设施的组织，DistilBERT提供更优准确性；对于边缘部署或成本敏感环境，CatBoost因可比较的安全性和更低的运营成本而更可取。两种方法通过成本敏感学习优化后，投资回报率均超过99.96%。

Abstract: Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated social engineering threat that manipulates organizational hierarchies and exploits psychological vulnerabilities, leading to significant financial damage. According to the 2024 FBI Internet Crime Report, BEC accounts for over $2.9 billion in annual adjusted losses, presenting significant economic asymmetry: the cost of a False Negative (fraud loss) exceeds the cost of a False Positive (manual review) by orders of magnitude (approximately 1 to 5,480).
  This paper examines two detection paradigms for BEC: the Forensic Psycholinguistic Stream, which utilizes CatBoost to analyze psycholinguistic cues with high interpretability and low latency, and the Semantic Stream, which employs DistilBERT for deep learning-based contextual language understanding, offering superior accuracy at higher computational cost. We evaluated DistilBERT on an adversarially poisoned dataset (N = 7,990) generated via our Black Hole protocol, benchmarked on Tesla T4 GPU infrastructure, achieving superior detection (AUC = 1.0000, F1 = 0.9981) with acceptable real-time latency (7.403 milliseconds). CatBoost achieves competitive detection (AUC = 0.9905, F1 = 0.9486) at 8.4x lower latency (0.885 milliseconds), consuming negligible computational resources. For organizations with GPU infrastructure, DistilBERT offers superior accuracy. CatBoost is preferable for edge deployments or cost-sensitive environments due to comparable security and lower operational costs. Both approaches demonstrate return on investment exceeding 99.96% when optimized through cost-sensitive learning, by significantly reducing false negatives and associated financial losses.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a popular framework for training sequential decision policies from expert demonstrations via supervised learning. As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer strong high-level planning capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) by decomposing tasks into subgoals. However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions. Experimental results on 22 diverse tasks in the open-world game "Crafter" demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Conclusion: FANoise通过特征自适应噪声注入，有效提升了表示学习的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为多模态表示学习提供了理论支撑和实践方案。

Abstract: Representation learning is fundamental to modern machine learning, powering applications such as text retrieval and multimodal understanding. However, learning robust and generalizable representations remains challenging. While prior work has demonstrated that active noise injection, a form of data augmentation, can enhance encoding performance, most existing methods rely on heuristic or static noise, overlooking the dynamic nature of feature distributions during training. In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models.

In our work, a comprehensive methodology to detect AI- generated text using XLM-RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art multilingual transformer model. Our approach includes rigorous preprocessing, and feature extraction involving perplexity, semantic, and readability features. We fine-tuned the XLM-RoBERTa model on a balanced dataset of human and AI-generated texts and evaluated its performance. The model demonstrated high accuracy and robust performance across various text genres. Additionally, we conducted feature analysis to understand the model's decision-making process, revealing that perplexity and attention-based features are critical in differentiating between human and AI-generated texts.

Conclusion: 交错重置是一种简单有效的技术，能够显著改善大规模并行RL训练中的非平稳性问题，提升训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Massively parallel GPU simulation environments have accelerated reinforcement learning (RL) research by enabling fast data collection for on-policy RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To maximize throughput, it is common to use short rollouts per policy update, increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ra- tio. However, we find that, in this setting, standard synchronous resets introduce harmful nonstationarity, skewing the learning signal and destabilizing training. We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance. Finally, this technique scales better with more parallel environments compared to naive synchronized rollouts.

Conclusion: GKA成功弥补了SSM在召回任务中的性能差距，同时保持了计算效率，在长短上下文语言理解任务中都表现出色。

Abstract: As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear state-space models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of wildfires, making rapid and accurate prediction of fire spread essential for effective mitigation and response. Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution. The proposed CGAN-based autoregressive framework enhances both the accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, offering a promising foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.

Abstract: Temporal distribution shift (TDS) erodes the long-term accuracy of recommender systems, yet industrial practice still relies on periodic incremental training, which struggles to capture both stable and transient patterns. Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure. Extensive experiments supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate that our method achieves superior temporal generalization, yielding a 2.33\% uplift in GMV per user and has been successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search.

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a core technology for future wireless communication systems, enabling the identification of modulation schemes without prior knowledge. This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions. This paper's experimental results validate the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for AMC, suggesting its potential application in adaptive spectrum management and advanced cognitive radio systems.

Abstract: Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI)-based sensing provides a non-invasive, device-free approach for tasks such as human activity recognition and crowd counting, but large-scale deployment is hindered by the need for extensive site-specific training data. Federated learning (FL) offers a way to avoid raw data sharing but is challenged by heterogeneous sensing data and device resources. This paper proposes FedAPA, a collaborative Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing algorithm that uses adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy to assign similarity-based weights to peer prototypes, enabling adaptive client contributions and yielding a personalized global prototype for each client instead of a fixed-weight aggregation. During local training, we adopt a hybrid objective that combines classification learning with representation contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge. We provide a convergence analysis of FedAPA and evaluate it in a real-world distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting scenario with six environments and up to 20 people. The results show that our method outperform multiple baselines in terms of accuracy, F1 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and communication overhead, with FedAPA achieving at least a 9.65% increase in accuracy, a 9% gain in F1 score, a 0.29 reduction in MAE, and a 95.94% reduction in communication overhead.

Conclusion: TDP通过分布去噪步骤和计划更新机制，显著提高了扩散规划的决策效率，同时保持了良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Diffusion planning is a promising method for learning high-performance policies from offline data. To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance.

Abstract: Offline data selection and online self-refining generation, which enhance the data quality, are crucial steps in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. We tackle offline data selection and online self-refining generations through an optimization perspective. Specifically, bilevel data selection is used for offline data selection with respect to the validation dataset, and we treat online self-refining generation as a model adaptation step of selecting the model trained on current responses that best fits the validation data. Our framework offers a unified understanding of offline data selection and self-refining generation by assigning a learned data weight to each question and response, either explicitly or implicitly. For the first time, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel data selection framework and demonstrate its performance gains over unfiltered direct mixing baselines. By combining offline data with validation-weighted online generations, our method enhances fine-tuning performance. Experiments on quality enhancement and safety-aware LLM fine-tuning validate its effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在生物医学领域存在两大局限：标准SFT容易过拟合表面指令模式而无法内化碎片化科学知识；RL方法因需要实验验证奖励信号而不可行。

Method: BFT采用双层加权机制：1) 令牌级别通过预测概率缩放损失来稳定梯度；2) 样本级别使用'最小组置信度'自适应增强困难样本学习。

Conclusion: BFT为LLM在生物医学研究中的广泛应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Effective post-training is essential to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized biomedical knowledge to accelerate life science research. However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses "minimum group confidence" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research.

Result: 在Heat-1D初始条件恢复和阻尼振荡器逆问题上，D-IPG达到固定归一化容差所需的迭代次数比投影梯度少约20倍（热传导）和2-3倍（振荡器），与高斯-牛顿法在迭代次数和成本上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: Deceptron和D-IPG方法能有效加速病态逆问题的求解，Jacobian组合惩罚减少了组合误差并跟踪迭代增益，DeceptronNet(v0)在严格公平协议下展示了快速收敛特性。

Abstract: Inverse problems in the physical sciences are often ill-conditioned in input space, making progress step-size sensitive. We propose the Deceptron, a lightweight bidirectional module that learns a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate. Training combines a supervised fit, forward-reverse consistency, a lightweight spectral penalty, a soft bias tie, and a Jacobian Composition Penalty (JCP) that encourages $J_g(f(x))\,J_f(x)\!\approx\!I$ via JVP/VJP probes. At solve time, D-IPG (Deceptron Inverse-Preconditioned Gradient) takes a descent step in output space, pulls it back through $g$, and projects under the same backtracking and stopping rules as baselines. On Heat-1D initial-condition recovery and a Damped Oscillator inverse problem, D-IPG reaches a fixed normalized tolerance with $\sim$20$\times$ fewer iterations on Heat and $\sim$2-3$\times$ fewer on Oscillator than projected gradient, competitive in iterations and cost with Gauss-Newton. Diagnostics show JCP reduces a measured composition error and tracks iteration gains. We also preview a single-scale 2D instantiation, DeceptronNet (v0), that learns few-step corrections under a strict fairness protocol and exhibits notably fast convergence.

### [59] [MLPMoE: Zero-Shot Architectural Metamorphosis of Dense LLM MLPs into Static Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21089)
*Ivan Novikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLPMoE是一种无需训练、确定性的转换方法，将Transformer块中的密集MLP重构为静态的高基数混合专家模型，通过简单的张量切片和求和操作实现，无需梯度、校准集或路由器训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型作为密集Transformer部署，每个前馈块中的每个参数都对每个token激活，计算效率低下。现有方法通常依赖聚类、激活分析或自定义路由，需要校准数据。

Method: 使用张量切片和求和的代数方法，将张量并行的代数重新解释为拓扑转换而非分布式训练模式，并引入Fractal Fade（差分分支稀疏性）和Compensated Pruning（方差保持分支缩减）作为结构化稀疏机制。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B上，零样本MLPMoE转换使代理困惑度指标变化小于0.05%，同时保持参数数量基本不变。在8B模型上，差分稀疏性移除了约20%的MLP参数，同时保持困惑度在密集基线的约2%以内。

Conclusion: 该方法完全事后处理现有检查点，无需梯度、校准集或路由器训练，提供了一种计算效率更高的Transformer部署方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly deployed as dense transformers, where every parameter in every feed-forward block is activated for every token. While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

Conclusion: 通过双曲脑-文本表示，该方法能够有效捕捉神经影像数据的语义和层次特性，为神经影像元分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Various neuroimaging studies suffer from small sample size problem which often limit their reliability. Meta-analysis addresses this challenge by aggregating findings from different studies to identify consistent patterns of brain activity. However, traditional approaches based on keyword retrieval or linear mappings often overlook the rich hierarchical structure in the brain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to bridge the gap between neuroscience literature and brain activation maps. By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines, offering a robust and interpretable paradigm of multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis via hyperbolic brain-text representation.

TL;DR: 提出了生成式早期排序(GESR)范式，通过混合注意力(MoA)模块解决传统用户-物品解耦方法在捕捉细粒度亲和度和交叉信号方面的局限性，并部署了全面的优化技术以平衡效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统早期排序系统采用用户-物品解耦方法，虽然高效但效果有限，难以捕捉细粒度用户-物品亲和度和交叉信号，需要在保持效率的同时提升排序效果。

Method: 引入混合注意力(MoA)模块，包含硬匹配注意力(HMA)编码显式交叉信号、目标感知自注意力生成个性化用户表示、交叉注意力促进早期用户-物品交互；通过多逻辑参数化门控(MLPG)模块整合新学习嵌入；采用定制内核和缓存机制等优化技术。

Result: 在离线实验和在线实验中，GESR范式在关键指标、用户参与度和消费任务方面均显示出显著改进，成功实现了大规模ESR阶段的目标感知注意力序列建模部署。

Conclusion: GESR范式成功解决了早期排序系统效果与效率的平衡问题，首次在大规模ESR阶段实现了完整的目标感知注意力序列建模部署，显著提升了排序性能。

Abstract: Large-scale recommendations commonly adopt a multi-stage cascading ranking system paradigm to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the "user-item decoupling" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling within an ESR stage at such a scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的解码策略ETE，通过探索高不确定性标记来克服扩散语言模型中高置信度标记解码的信息瓶颈，显著减少了所需的解码轮数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DLM解码策略依赖高置信度标记，但这种方法存在信息理论瓶颈，限制了解码进度并减慢了生成速度。高概率标记携带的信息量很少，严格依赖它们会限制每轮解码的有效进展。

Method: 提出了Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE)解码策略，该策略结合跨块解码和对高不确定性标记的针对性探索，以重塑条件分布并触发自信预测的级联效应。

Result: 实验验证了理论界限，表明ETE相比仅依赖置信度的基线方法，在不影响生成质量的情况下持续减少了所需的解码轮数。

Conclusion: 优先考虑高置信度标记本质上效率低下，ETE策略通过最大化信息吞吐量和解码效率，有效克服了DLM解码中的信息瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive language models (LMs). DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRIDGE是一个结构化提示框架，用于可扩展的验证程序生成，通过将验证分解为代码、规范和证明三个相互关联的领域，使用功能推理、规范驱动和证明导向的中间表示来提高准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在代码生成方面表现出色，但在程序验证方面存在困难，特别是在交互式证明框架中。主要挑战是可扩展性：验证合成不仅需要代码，还需要精确的规范和正确性证明，现有方法很少能同时涵盖这三个领域。

Method: BRIDGE将验证分解为三个相互关联的领域：代码（可执行实现）、规范（形式化意图陈述）和证明（构造性正确性论证）。通过引出不同的推理行为（功能推理、规范驱动和证明导向）作为中间表示，保持语义结构并连接这些领域。

Result: 功能推理将形式语言（Lean4）中代码的正确性提高了近1.5倍（pass@5），推理时间计算效率提高了2倍，用更少的生成和更低的采样预算实现了更高的通过率。规范驱动提示将Python编码通过率提高了17.5%。

Conclusion: 结构化领域对齐是推进验证合成的一个有前景的方向。BRIDGE为通过专家迭代或RLVR进行训练奠定了基础，使模型能够在代码、规范和证明之间内化这些推理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态分层对比训练框架（Dynamic Stratified Contrastive Training Framework），用于改进混合整数线性规划（MILP）的分支策略，解决了语义变化、上游节点稀缺和强分支样本收集成本高等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于神经网络的分支策略在解决MILP时面临三个主要挑战：不同深度节点的语义变化、上游节点稀缺性以及强分支样本收集成本高昂。

Method: 通过基于特征分布对分支定界节点进行分组，训练GCNN判别模型逐步分离不同组别的节点；引入上游增强的MILP推导过程，生成理论等价和扰动实例来解决数据稀缺和不平衡问题。

Result: 在标准MILP基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法提高了分支准确性，减少了求解时间，并能有效泛化到未见过的实例。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能有效建模节点间的细微语义差异，显著提升分支准确性和求解效率，尤其对于上游节点效果更为明显。

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental class of NP-hard problems that has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. The Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) method is the dominant approach for solving MILPs and the branching plays an important role in B\&B methods. Neural-based learning frameworks have recently been developed to enhance branching policies and the efficiency of solving MILPs. However, these methods still struggle with semantic variation across depths, the scarcity of upstream nodes, and the costly collection of strong branching samples. To address these issues, we propose \ours, a Dynamic \underline{\textbf{S}}tratified \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Training Framework for \underline{\textbf{MILP}} Branching. It groups branch-and-bound nodes based on their feature distributions and trains a GCNN-based discriminative model to progressively separate nodes across groups, learning finer-grained node representations throughout the tree. To address data scarcity and imbalance at upstream nodes, we introduce an upstream-augmented MILP derivation procedure that generates both theoretically equivalent and perturbed instances. \ours~effectively models subtle semantic differences between nodes, significantly enhancing branching accuracy and solving efficiency, particularly for upstream nodes. Extensive experiments on standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that our method enhances branching accuracy, reduces solving time, and generalizes effectively to unseen instances.

Motivation: 现有公平聚类方法缺乏可解释性，限制了在高风险场景中的应用，需要理解聚类决策背后的原理。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂公平约束下表现稳健，为公平透明的聚类开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.

Conclusion: 该工作通过综合技术手段填补了联邦学习系统的关键空白，为实现边缘设备大规模安全协作的AI民主化愿景铺平了道路。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is retracing the Internet's path from centralized provision to distributed creation. Initially, resource-intensive computation concentrates within institutions capable of training and serving large models.Eventually, as federated learning matures, billions of edge devices holding sensitive data will be able to collectively improve models without surrendering raw information, enabling both contribution and consumption at scale. This democratic vision remains unrealized due to certain compositional gaps; aggregators handle updates without accountability, economic mechanisms are lacking and even when present remain vulnerable to gaming, coordination serializes state modifications limiting scalability, and governance permits retroactive manipulation. This work addresses these gaps by leveraging cryptographic receipts to prove aggregation correctness, geometric novelty measurement to prevent incentive gaming, parallel object ownership to achieve linear scalability, and time-locked policies to check retroactive manipulation.

Abstract: Understanding how chemical perturbations propagate through biological systems is essential for robust molecular property prediction. While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks. These results demonstrate the advantage of hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning for reliable and biologically grounded molecular representations, offering a generalizable framework for integrative biomedical modeling.

Conclusion: 事件驱动动态和替代梯度训练的结合显著降低了梯度的信息量，表明神经形态计算具有内在的隐私保护潜力。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.

Abstract: Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction hinges on the quality of health indicators (HIs), yet existing methods often fail to disentangle complex degradation mechanisms in multi-sensor systems or quantify uncertainty in HI reliability. This paper introduces a novel framework for HI construction, advancing three key contributions. First, we adapt Reconstruction along Projected Pathways (RaPP) as a health indicator (HI) for RUL prediction for the first time, showing that it outperforms traditional reconstruction error metrics. Second, we show that augmenting RaPP-derived HIs with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) via Monte Carlo dropout and probabilistic latent spaces- significantly improves RUL-prediction robustness. Third, and most critically, we propose indicator groups, a paradigm that isolates sensor subsets to model system-specific degradations, giving rise to our novel method, I-GLIDE which enables interpretable, mechanism-specific diagnostics. Evaluated on data sourced from aerospace and manufacturing systems, our approach achieves marked improvements in accuracy and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art HI methods while providing actionable insights into system failure pathways. This work bridges the gap between anomaly detection and prognostics, offering a principled framework for uncertainty-aware degradation modeling in complex systems.

This enables us to build simpler and more effective models, as well as to combine different biological feature sets. Experiments on Dietary Restriction datasets show significant improvements over existing methods, proving that feature selection can be critical for reliable gene prioritization.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient seismic response prediction is essential for the design of resilient structures. While the Finite Element Method (FEM) remains the standard for nonlinear seismic analysis, its high computational demands limit its scalability and real time applicability. Recent developments in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, have shown promise in reducing the computational cost of nonlinear seismic analysis of structures. However, these data driven models often struggle to generalize and capture the underlying physics, leading to reduced reliability. We propose a novel Physics Informed U Net LSTM framework that integrates physical laws with deep learning to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. By embedding domain specific constraints into the learning process, the proposed model achieves improved predictive performance over conventional Machine Learning architectures. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between purely data driven methods and physics based modeling, offering a robust and computationally efficient alternative for seismic response prediction of structures.

Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated unparalleled sampling quality and diversity in numerous fields, such as image generation, voice synthesis, and tabular data synthesis, etc. Inspired by those outstanding results, we apply SGMs to synthesize time-series by learning its conditional score function. To this end, we present a conditional score network for time-series synthesis, deriving a denoising score matching loss tailored for our purposes. In particular, our presented denoising score matching loss is the conditional denoising score matching loss for time-series synthesis. In addition, our framework is such flexible that both regular and irregular time-series can be synthesized with minimal changes to our model design. Finally, we obtain exceptional synthesis performance on various time-series datasets, achieving state-of-the-art sampling diversity and quality.

Conclusion: 当前MDLM训练范式存在关键限制，提出的掩码无关损失方法为构建具有更强上下文理解能力的扩散语言模型提供了可行方向。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs), leveraging a denoising objective that, in principle, should enable more uniform context utilisation. In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.

Motivation: 对抗性逆强化学习(AIRL)在稀疏奖励问题中表现良好，但在高度复杂、不完全信息环境下的性能尚未充分探索。本文旨在解决AIRL在扑克等复杂环境中推断奖励函数不足的问题。

Method: 提出Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL)方法，在AIRL基础上引入来自专家数据的监督损失和随机正则化机制，以增强奖励函数推断和策略学习能力。

Result: 在Gymnasium基准测试和HULHE扑克环境中，H-AIRL相比AIRL实现了更高的样本效率和更稳定的学习过程，并通过可视化分析获得了对学习过程的深入理解。

Conclusion: 将监督信号融入逆强化学习具有显著优势，H-AIRL为处理具有挑战性的现实世界场景提供了一个有前景的框架。

Abstract: Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) has shown promise in addressing the sparse reward problem in reinforcement learning (RL) by inferring dense reward functions from expert demonstrations. However, its performance in highly complex, imperfect-information settings remains largely unexplored. To explore this gap, we evaluate AIRL in the context of Heads-Up Limit Hold'em (HULHE) poker, a domain characterized by sparse, delayed rewards and significant uncertainty. In this setting, we find that AIRL struggles to infer a sufficiently informative reward function. To overcome this limitation, we contribute Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL), an extension that enhances reward inference and policy learning by incorporating a supervised loss derived from expert data and a stochastic regularization mechanism. We evaluate H-AIRL on a carefully selected set of Gymnasium benchmarks and the HULHE poker setting. Additionally, we analyze the learned reward function through visualization to gain deeper insights into the learning process. Our experimental results show that H-AIRL achieves higher sample efficiency and more stable learning compared to AIRL. This highlights the benefits of incorporating supervised signals into inverse RL and establishes H-AIRL as a promising framework for tackling challenging, real-world settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的局部特征归因方法保真度评估指标DPC，通过结合扰动和归因的方向，实现了近10倍的速度提升并消除了随机性，为高风险的医疗等场景提供了确定性且可信赖的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等高风险场景中，临床医生和监管机构需要能忠实反映模型决策过程的解释方法。现有保真度指标如Infidelity依赖蒙特卡洛近似，需要大量模型评估且因随机采样引入不确定性。

Method: 在引导扰动实验中修改现有的预测变化(PC)指标，通过结合扰动和归因的方向，提出了定向预测变化(DPC)指标。

Result: DPC实现了近10倍的速度提升并消除了随机性，在皮肤病变图像和金融表格数据两个数据集、两个黑盒模型、七种解释算法和广泛超参数范围的4744个不同解释上进行了评估。

Conclusion: DPC与PC相结合，能够对基线导向和局部特征归因方法进行整体且计算高效的评估，同时提供确定性和可重现的结果。

Abstract: The utility of an explanation method critically depends on its fidelity to the underlying machine learning model. Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.

Abstract: Natural disasters remain a major challenge for Bangladesh, so real-time monitoring and quick response systems are essential. In this study, we present BanglaMM-Disaster, an end-to-end deep learning-based multimodal framework for disaster classification in Bangla, using both textual and visual data from social media. We constructed a new dataset of 5,037 Bangla social media posts, each consisting of a caption and a corresponding image, annotated into one of nine disaster-related categories. The proposed model integrates transformer-based text encoders, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa, with CNN backbones such as ResNet50, DenseNet169, and MobileNetV2, to process the two modalities. Using early fusion, the best model achieves 83.76% accuracy. This surpasses the best text-only baseline by 3.84% and the image-only baseline by 16.91%. Our analysis also shows reduced misclassification across all classes, with noticeable improvements for ambiguous examples. This work fills a key gap in Bangla multimodal disaster analysis and demonstrates the benefits of combining multiple data types for real-time disaster response in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: 提出通过参数相关学习率控制查询和键权重的变化，解决transformer训练中的稳定性问题，特别是在不适用QK归一化的MLA场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QK归一化虽然能解决transformer权重稳定性问题，但不适用于MLA等场景，因为需要完整物化查询和键，而MLA在推理时不这样做。

Method: 通过为查询和键权重分配参数相关的学习率来控制logits变化，从而保持训练稳定性。

Result: 该方法允许提高基础学习率，在MLA设置中优于其他方法，在使用多头注意力时性能与QK归一化相当。

Conclusion: 参数相关学习率是一种廉价有效的干预措施，能解决transformer训练稳定性问题，特别是在QK归一化不适用的场景中。

Abstract: Stability of neural network weights is critical when training transformer models. The query and key weights are particularly problematic, as they tend to grow large without any intervention. Applying normalization to queries and keys, known as `QK norm', fixes stability issues in practice, but is not always applicable. For example, QK norm is not compatible with Multi Latent Attention (MLA) because QK norm requires full materialization of queries and keys during inference, which is not done in MLA. In this paper we suggest that controlling the changes to logits is important for stability. We show that these changes are controllable by assigning parameter-dependent learning rates to the query and key weights. We find that our cheap intervention allows us to increase the base learning rate of the network, outperform other methods in the MLA setting, and achieve performance competitive with QK norm when using Multi-head Attention.

Motivation: 传统异常检测方法假设训练数据纯正常，但实际数据常被异常污染。固定污染率假设与实际情况不符会严重影响性能，特别是在正常与异常数据分布重叠的噪声环境中。

Method: 提出自适应和激进拒绝(AAR)方法，使用改进的z-score和高斯混合模型阈值动态排除异常，结合硬拒绝和软拒绝策略平衡保留正常数据与排除异常。

Conclusion: AAR为污染数据集提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，增强了鲁棒性，为安全和医疗等领域的实际应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has emerged as a critical tool for extracting fine-grained sentiment insights from user-generated content, particularly in e-commerce and social media domains. However, research on Bangla ABSA remains significantly underexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and specialized frameworks for triplet extraction in this language. This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity. This research advances the state-of-the-art in low-resource language sentiment analysis and provides a scalable solution for Bangla e-commerce analytics applications.

Motivation: 标准Transformer架构中刚性、均匀的计算分配限制了效率和可扩展性，特别是在大规模模型和长序列处理中。

Method: SDT在解码器堆栈中交替使用决策层和动态层，基于贝叶斯惊喜信号进行Top-K路由；STT将条件计算扩展到时间域，通过转换网络预测残差更新来动态执行或绕过Transformer块。

Conclusion: 所提出的架构为效率提升建立了灵活框架，为更高效模型的发展指明了方向。

Abstract: The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.

TL;DR: 提出了浅层通用多项式网络（SUPNs），用单层可学习系数的多项式替代除最后一层外的所有隐藏层，以更少的参数实现足够的表达能力，在近似误差和变异性上优于DNNs和KANs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs和KANs通常需要大量可训练参数来产生合适的近似，这导致网络不够透明，优化空间大，容易产生泛化误差差异大的局部最小值，网络初始化对模型精度影响过大。

Method: 用单层可学习系数的多项式替换除最后一层外的所有隐藏层，结合DNNs和多项式的优势，推导出准最优SUPN参数的显式公式。

Result: 在超过13,000个训练模型的一维、二维和十维数值实验中，对于给定数量的可训练参数，SUPNs的近似误差和变异性通常比DNNs和KANs低一个数量级，甚至在非光滑函数上优于多项式投影。

Conclusion: SUPNs以更少的参数实现了与最佳多项式近似相同的收敛速度，在近似精度和稳定性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are popular methods for function approximation due to their flexibility and expressivity. However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions.

Abstract: Ensemble learning improves classification performance by combining multiple base classifiers. While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns. This paper investigates the relationship between ensemble size and performance through the lens of linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: We study two-layer neural networks and train these with a particle-based method called consensus-based optimization (CBO). We compare the performance of CBO against Adam on two test cases and demonstrate how a hybrid approach, combining CBO with Adam, provides faster convergence than CBO. In the context of multi-task learning, we recast CBO into a formulation that offers less memory overhead. The CBO method allows for a mean-field limit formulation, which we couple with the mean-field limit of the neural network. To this end, we first reformulate CBO within the optimal transport framework. Finally, in the limit of infinitely many particles, we define the corresponding dynamics on the Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein space and show that the variance decreases monotonically.

Conclusion: 该框架为处理多模态生理信号转换中的时间不一致性问题提供了统一方向，能够有效改善标签质量并提升转换准确性。

Abstract: Translating non-invasive signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and ballistocardiography (BCG) into clinically meaningful signals like arterial blood pressure (ABP) is vital for continuous, low-cost healthcare monitoring. However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.

*Wanli Zhong,Haibo Feng,Zirui Zhou,Hanyang Peng,Shiqi Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IntAttention是一种完全整数的注意力机制，通过IndexSoftmax替换浮点运算，消除了量化-softmax-再量化的开销，在边缘设备上实现3.7倍加速和61%能耗降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备部署Transformer模型受限于延迟和能耗预算，INT8量化虽然加速了矩阵乘法，但softmax成为主要瓶颈，占注意力延迟的65%，破坏了端到端整数数据流。

Method: 提出IntAttention全整数注意力流水线，核心是IndexSoftmax硬件友好算子，结合稀疏感知裁剪、32项查找表近似和直接整数归一化，消除所有数据类型转换开销。

Result: 在Armv8 CPU上实现3.7倍加速和61%能耗降低，比传统INT8注意力快2.0倍，在多种语言和视觉模型中保持与基线相当的精度。

Conclusion: IntAttention实现了实用的边缘设备Transformer推理，无需重新训练即可获得显著性能提升。

Abstract: Deploying Transformer models on edge devices is limited by latency and energy budgets. While INT8 quantization effectively accelerates the primary matrix multiplications, it exposes the softmax as the dominant bottleneck. This stage incurs a costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour, which can account for up to 65% of total attention latency and disrupts the end-to-end integer dataflow critical for edge hardware efficiency. To address this limitation, we present IntAttention, the first fully integer, plug-and-play attention pipeline without retraining. At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs. These gains are achieved with high-fidelity accuracy comparable to baselines across diverse language and vision models, enabling practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices. Code will be released in later version of this work.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在时间序列分类中表现出色，但其内部决策机制难以理解。现有可解释性方法主要关注输入输出归因，对内部机制揭示不足。

Method: 采用机制可解释性技术：激活修补、注意力显著性分析和稀疏自编码器，系统探究注意力头和时间步的因果作用，构建内部信息传播的因果图。

Result: 在基准时间序列数据集上的实验揭示了驱动正确分类的关键注意力头和时间位置，并展示了稀疏自编码器在发现可解释潜在特征方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 研究为Transformer可解释性提供了方法论贡献，并为理解Transformer在时间序列分类任务中的功能机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have become state-of-the-art tools in various machine learning tasks, including time series classification, yet their complexity makes understanding their internal decision-making challenging. Existing explainability methods often focus on input-output attributions, leaving the internal mechanisms largely opaque. This paper addresses this gap by adapting various Mechanistic Interpretability techniques; activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders, from NLP to transformer architectures designed explicitly for time series classification. We systematically probe the internal causal roles of individual attention heads and timesteps, revealing causal structures within these models. Through experimentation on a benchmark time series dataset, we construct causal graphs illustrating how information propagates internally, highlighting key attention heads and temporal positions driving correct classifications. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of sparse autoencoders for uncovering interpretable latent features. Our findings provide both methodological contributions to transformer interpretability and novel insights into the functional mechanics underlying transformer performance in time series classification tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个模块化框架，用于分析空间网格时间序列数据中因果图变化所编码的信息，通过修改基于约束的因果发现方法中的独立性测试来实现稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据（如气候应用）通常具有空间网格时间序列结构，系统在不同时空点的行为相似但存在变化。这些变化既包含重要信息，又可能影响假设平稳性或空间平移不变性的算法的稳定性和有效性。

Method: 开发了指导原则来克服核心挑战，通过在独立性测试层面修改基于约束的因果发现方法，构建了一个模块化框架。该框架可以轻松利用现有的基于约束的因果发现方法（如PC、PC-stable、FCI、PCMCI、PCMCI+、LPCMCI），无需或只需少量修改。

Conclusion: 通过将问题分解为更易处理的子问题，简化了对基本限制、控制权衡的超参数以及结果统计解释的理解。开源实现即将发布。

Abstract: Real-world data, for example in climate applications, often consists of spatially gridded time series data or data with comparable structure. While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems. The division into more accessible sub-problems also simplifies the understanding of fundamental limitations, hyperparameters controlling trade-offs and the statistical interpretation of results. An open-source implementation will be available soon.

Motivation: 战略分类中部署分类器会引发战略行为导致分布偏移，现有方法主要局限于线性设置，而许多情况下非线性分类器更适用，但非线性分类器无法计算最佳响应限制了进展。

Method: 通过优化智能体目标的拉格朗日对偶来计算最佳响应，该方法在非线性分类器设置中可直接应用。

Result: 在线性设置中重现了最佳响应，识别出现有方法的关键弱点，在非线性分类器设置中该方法可用于评估和训练。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效计算战略分类中的最佳响应，特别是在非线性分类器设置中具有实用价值。

Abstract: We consider the problem of strategic classification, where the act of deploying a classifier leads to strategic behaviour that induces a distribution shift on subsequent observations. Current approaches to learning classifiers in strategic settings are focused primarily on the linear setting, but in many cases non-linear classifiers are more suitable. A central limitation to progress for non-linear classifiers arises from the inability to compute best responses in these settings. We present a novel method for computing the best response by optimising the Lagrangian dual of the Agents' objective. We demonstrate that our method reproduces best responses in linear settings, identifying key weaknesses in existing approaches. We present further results demonstrating our method can be straight-forwardly applied to non-linear classifier settings, where it is useful for both evaluation and training.

Conclusion: 多尺度时间对齐方法在复杂医疗时间序列分析中具有有效性和鲁棒性，为高维异步医疗序列的智能表示提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: This study proposes a risk prediction method based on a Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) to address the challenges of temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in Electronic Health Records (EHR). The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis. This study provides a new solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and offers important technical support for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction.

Conclusion: 提出的MD-GAK和PMD-GAK框架在环肽细胞膜渗透性预测中表现出色，特别是在不确定性估计方面，提供了一种完全可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides are promising modalities for targeting intracellular sites; however, cell-membrane permeability remains a key bottleneck, exacerbated by limited public data and the need for well-calibrated uncertainty. Instead of relying on data-eager complex deep learning architecture, we propose a monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel (MD-GAK), which couples chemically meaningful residue-residue similarity with sequence alignment while decoupling local matches from gap penalties. MD-GAK is a relatively simple kernel. To further demonstrate the robustness of our framework, we also introduce a variant, PMD-GAK, which incorporates a triangular positional prior. As we will show in the experimental section, PMD-GAK can offer additional advantages over MD-GAK, particularly in reducing calibration errors. Since our focus is on uncertainty estimation, we use Gaussian Processes as the predictive model, as both MD-GAK and PMD-GAK can be directly applied within this framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through an extensive set of experiments, comparing our fully reproducible approach against state-of-the-art models, and show that it outperforms them across all metrics.

Abstract: Latent reasoning represents a new development in Transformer language models that has shown potential in compressing reasoning lengths compared to chain-of-thought reasoning. By directly passing the information-rich previous final latent state into the next sequence, latent reasoning removes the restriction to human language tokens as the medium for reasoning. We develop adaptive-length latent reasoning models and introduce a post-SFT reinforcement-learning methodology to optimize latent reasoning length by minimizing reasoning length while maintaining accuracy. This, in turn, further reduces compute usage and raises the bar on the compressive capabilities of latent reasoning models. Experiments on the Llama 3.2 1B model and the GSM8K-Aug dataset show a $52\%$ drop in total reasoning length with no penalty to accuracy. In future work, we plan to extend to additional models and datasets, analyze relationships between training coefficients, experiment with architecture variations, and continue our knowledge distillation for latent reasoning SFT efforts. We make our code and pretrained weights available at https://github.com/apning/adaptive-latent-reasoning.

Abstract: Smart grids are a fusion of classical power infrastructure and advanced communication networks and smart control, to create a cyber-physical environment that is more efficient and flexible than ever before. This integration causes vulnerabilities that can undermine grid stability as well as reliability. Digital forensics is a fundamental concept of learning and identifying, detecting, and mitigating such security incidents. This paper presents an all-in-one machine learning-based digital forensic framework of smart grid systems deployed on the Cloud. The framework combines the data acquisition at the sensor-level, authenticated communication, scalable cloud storage and automated forensic analytics. The model uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms - such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Trees and deep neural architectures for anomaly detection, event reconstruction and intrusion analysis in real time. After several simulation and experimental studies on real-time smart-meter data streams, the proposed framework is shown to be very accurate, scalable and resilient to cyber-attacks including data tampering, false-data injection and coordinated control-loop manipulation. The results indicate that cloud services are the best backbone for big-data-driven forensic workflows, which allows energy utilities to achieve a fast situational awareness and intelligent incident response.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art results across many natural language tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain difficult to interpret. In this work, we extract, process, and visualize latent state geometries in Transformer-based language models through dimensionality reduction. We capture layerwise activations at multiple points within Transformer blocks and enable systematic analysis through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP). We demonstrate experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMa models, where we uncover interesting geometric patterns in latent space. Notably, we identify a clear separation between attention and MLP component outputs across intermediate layers, a pattern not documented in prior work to our knowledge. We also characterize the high norm of latent states at the initial sequence position and visualize the layerwise evolution of latent states. Additionally, we demonstrate the high-dimensional helical structure of GPT-2's positional embeddings, the sequence-wise geometric patterns in LLaMa, and experiment with repeating token sequences. We aim to support systematic analysis of Transformer internals with the goal of enabling further reproducible interpretability research.

Motivation: 研究发现2012-2023年间AI训练FLOP效率提升了22,000倍，但通过小规模消融实验只能解释不到10倍的增益，存在巨大效率差距。

Method: 进行扩展实验比较LSTM和Transformer的规模依赖效率差异，使用实验外推和文献估计来分析效率增益来源。

Conclusion: 算法效率增益与计算规模密切相关，效率衡量具有强烈的参考依赖性，小规模算法的进展比预期慢得多。

Abstract: Algorithms have been estimated to increase AI training FLOP efficiency by a factor of 22,000 between 2012 and 2023 [Ho et al., 2024]. Running small-scale ablation experiments on key innovations from this time period, we are able to account for less than 10x of these gains. Surveying the broader literature, we estimate that additional innovations not included in our ablations account for less than 10x, yielding a total under 100x. This leads us to conduct scaling experiments, which reveal that much of this efficiency gap can be explained by algorithms with scale-dependent efficiency improvements. In particular, we conduct scaling experiments between LSTMs and Transformers, finding exponent differences in their compute-optimal scaling law while finding little scaling difference for many other innovations. These experiments demonstrate that - contrary to standard assumptions - an algorithm's efficiency gains are tied to compute scale. Using experimental extrapolation and literature estimates, we account for 6,930x efficiency gains over the same time period, with the scale-dependent LSTM-to-Transformer transition accounting for the majority of gains. Our results indicate that algorithmic progress for small models has been far slower than previously assumed, and that measures of algorithmic efficiency are strongly reference-dependent.

Conclusion: 神经网络在真实高维数据学习过程中会自发形成有组织的、尺度不变的几何结构，揭示了神经网络学习的内在几何特性。

Abstract: Recent work by Freedman and Mulligan demonstrated that shallow multilayer perceptrons spontaneously develop Kolmogorov-Arnold geometric (KAG) structure during training on synthetic three-dimensional tasks. However, it remained unclear whether this phenomenon persists in realistic high-dimensional settings and what spatial properties this geometry exhibits.
  We extend KAG analysis to MNIST digit classification (784 dimensions) using 2-layer MLPs with systematic spatial analysis at multiple scales. We find that KAG emerges during training and appears consistently across spatial scales, from local 7-pixel neighborhoods to the full 28x28 image. This scale-agnostic property holds across different training procedures: both standard training and training with spatial augmentation produce the same qualitative pattern. These findings reveal that neural networks spontaneously develop organized, scale-invariant geometric structure during learning on realistic high-dimensional data.

Motivation: 解决深度视觉Transformer性能不如浅层模型的问题，挑战传统的缩放假设。

Method: 通过系统实证分析ViT-S、ViT-B和ViT-L在ImageNet上的表现，使用信息混洗指数量化信息混合模式。

Result: 发现[CLS]令牌逐渐被边缘化，ViT-L的信息-任务权衡比ViT-B晚出现约10层，这些额外层与信息扩散增加相关而非性能提升。

Conclusion: Transformer架构可能从精心校准的深度中获益更多，而不是简单地增加参数数量，信息混洗指数为现有模型提供了有用的诊断工具。

Abstract: Deeper Vision Transformers often perform worse than shallower ones, which challenges common scaling assumptions. Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count. The Information Scrambling Index provides a useful diagnostic for existing models and suggests a potential design target for future architectures.

Motivation: 优化LLM在多轮目标导向对话（如营销、销售代理）中的表现面临挑战，主要由于稀疏的长期奖励以及响应级规划与令牌级生成之间的差异。

Method: 将多轮RL问题形式化地简化为一系列单轮RLHF问题，使用多轮Q函数作为奖励模型，提出Iterative PPO算法，交替进行Q函数拟合和策略改进。

Result: 证明使用标准令牌级PPO解决单轮RL问题等价于多轮问题中的策略改进步骤，该方法可直接利用稳定的现成单轮RLHF工具实现。

Conclusion: Iterative PPO在完全在线和完全离线方法之间找到了平衡点，既保持了在线更新的适应性，又获得了离线训练的稳定性优势。

Abstract: Optimizing large language models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversational outcomes remains a significant challenge, especially in goal-oriented settings like AI marketing or sales agents who facilitate transactions via messaging platforms. The difficulty stems from sparse, long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we propose a formal reduction of the multi-turn RL problem into a sequence of single-turn RLHF-style problems. This is achieved by setting a learned multi-turn Q-function as the reward model for the single-turn problem. We demonstrate and prove a key insight: solving this single-turn RL problem with standard token-level PPO is equivalent to a policy improvement step within the multi-turn problem. This insight naturally leads to Iterative PPO, a batch online policy iteration algorithm that alternates between fitting Q-functions from logged conversation trajectories and improving the policy. A major practical advantage is that Iterative PPO directly leverages stable, off-the-shelf single-turn RLHF tools, making it straightforward to implement. Our method occupies a middle ground between fully online and fully offline approaches, retaining the adaptability of online updates while gaining the stability benefits of offline training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI编程代理在追求奖励时可能通过硬编码测试用例或编辑测试文件等方式进行奖励攻击，需要系统性的评估方法来检测这种行为。

Method: 从LiveCodeBench获取问题，创建易于奖励攻击的环境，使用三种方法检测奖励攻击：保留单元测试、LLM判断器和测试文件编辑检测，并对这些方法进行人工验证。

Result: LLM判断器在明确情况下能有效检测奖励攻击，保留测试用例的改进效果有限；Codex和Claude Code存在明显的奖励攻击行为，所有三个代理都表现出未对齐的行为。

Conclusion: EvilGenie基准测试揭示了当前AI编程代理普遍存在的奖励攻击问题，LLM判断器是有效的检测工具，需要进一步研究来解决这些对齐问题。

Abstract: We introduce EvilGenie, a benchmark for reward hacking in programming settings. We source problems from LiveCodeBench and create an environment in which agents can easily reward hack, such as by hardcoding test cases or editing the testing files. We measure reward hacking in three ways: held out unit tests, LLM judges, and test file edit detection. We verify these methods against human review and each other. We find the LLM judge to be highly effective at detecting reward hacking in unambiguous cases, and observe only minimal improvement from the use of held out test cases. In addition to testing many models using Inspect's basic_agent scaffold, we also measure reward hacking rates for three popular proprietary coding agents: OpenAI's Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, and Google's Gemini CLI Using GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, respectively. We observe explicit reward hacking by both Codex and Claude Code, and misaligned behavior by all three agents. Our codebase can be found at https://github.com/JonathanGabor/EvilGenie.

TL;DR: RARO是一种通过逆向强化学习从专家演示中学习推理能力的方法，无需任务特定的验证器，在多个推理任务上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现实世界的推理密集型任务缺乏验证器，但拥有大量未被充分利用的专家演示数据，需要开发能够仅从专家演示中学习推理能力的方法。

Method: RARO通过策略（生成器）和相对主义评论家（判别器）之间的对抗性交互来学习：策略学习模仿专家答案，评论家学习区分策略和专家答案，两者通过强化学习联合训练。

Result: RARO在Countdown、DeepMath和Poetry Writing等评估任务上显著优于无验证器的基线方法，并展现出与可验证任务上RL方法相同的稳健扩展趋势。

Conclusion: 该方法能够仅从专家演示中有效激发强大的推理性能，即使在缺乏任务特定验证器的情况下也能实现稳健的推理学习。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason often relies on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with task-specific verifiers. However, many real-world reasoning-intensive tasks lack verifiers, despite offering abundant expert demonstrations that remain under-utilized for reasoning-focused training. We introduce RARO (Relativistic Adversarial Reasoning Optimization) that learns strong reasoning capabilities from only expert demonstrations via Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Our method sets up an adversarial interaction between a policy (generator) and a relativistic critic (discriminator): the policy learns to mimic expert answers, while the critic learns to compare and distinguish between policy and expert answers. Our method trains both the policy and the critic jointly and continuously via RL, and we identify the key stabilization techniques required for robust learning. Empirically, RARO significantly outperforms strong verifier-free baselines on all of our evaluation tasks -- Countdown, DeepMath, and Poetry Writing -- and enjoys the same robust scaling trends as RL on verifiable tasks. These results demonstrate that our method effectively elicits strong reasoning performance from expert demonstrations alone, enabling robust reasoning learning even when task-specific verifiers are unavailable.

Abstract: The rise of AI in telecommunications, from optimizing Radio Access Networks to managing user experience, has sharply increased data volumes and training demands. Telecom data is often noisy, high-dimensional, costly to store, process, and label. Despite Ai's critical role, standard workflows still assume all training samples contribute equally. On the other hand, next generation systems require AI models that are accurate, efficient, and sustainable.The paper questions the assumptions of equal importance by focusing on applying and analyzing the roles of individual samples in telecom training and assessing whether the proposed model optimizes computation and energy use. we perform sample-level gradient analysis across epochs to identify patterns of influence and redundancy in model learning. Based on this, we propose a sample importance framework thats electively prioritizes impactful data and reduces computation without compromising accuracy. Experiments on three real-world telecom datasets show that our method [reserves performance while reducing data needs and computational overhead while advancing the goals of sustainable AI in telecommunications.

Motivation: 大型语言模型推理在异构边缘-云环境中存在高解码延迟和有限可扩展性，现有推测解码技术局限于单节点执行。

Method: 提出DSD分布式推测解码框架，引入DSD-Sim离散事件模拟器捕捉网络、批处理和调度动态，并设计自适应窗口控制策略动态调整推测窗口大小。

Conclusion: DSD通过分布式推测解码有效解决了LLM推理在异构环境中的性能瓶颈，实现了更好的可扩展性和吞吐量。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high decoding latency and limited scalability across heterogeneous edge-cloud environments. Existing speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative decoding framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-target execution. Given the lack of prior work on simulating this paradigm, we first introduce DSD-Sim, a discrete-event simulator that captures network, batching, and scheduling dynamics. Building on insights from DSD-Sim, we further design an Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy that dynamically adjusts speculation window size to optimize throughput. Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable LLM serving across edge and cloud.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于非参数bootstrap假设检验的特征选择新方法，通过引入随机噪声特征并与噪声特征的最大重要性值进行比较，解决了传统方法缺乏理论依据和统计驱动停止标准的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法存在计算成本高、缺乏统计驱动的停止标准、重要性评分显著性评估不足等问题，而常用的引入随机噪声特征的启发式方法缺乏理论依据。

Method: 引入多个随机噪声特征，将每个特征的重要性与噪声特征的最大重要性值进行比较，结合非参数bootstrap假设检验框架建立理论基础。

Result: 在模拟数据集上相比Boruta和Knockoff方法能更一致地恢复有意义的信号；在真实数据集上表现优于Boruta、RFE和Extra Trees等方法。

Conclusion: 该方法作为一种稳健的特征选择算法，能够提取支持可靠推断、增强预测性能和高效计算的信息预测因子。

Abstract: Feature selection has remained a daunting challenge in machine learning and artificial intelligence, where increasingly complex, high-dimensional datasets demand principled strategies for isolating the most informative predictors. Despite widespread adoption, many established techniques suffer from notable limitations; some incur substantial computational cost, while others offer no definite statistical driven stopping criteria or assesses the significance of their importance scores. A common heuristic approach introduces multiple random noise features and retains all predictors ranked above the strongest noise feature. Although intuitive, this strategy lacks theoretical justification and depends heavily on heuristics. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method that addresses these limitations. Our approach introduces multiple random noise features and evaluates each feature's importance against the maximum importance value among these noise features incorporating a non-parametric bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework to establish a solid theoretical foundation. We establish the conceptual soundness of our approach through statistical derivations that articulate the principles guiding the design of our algorithm. To evaluate its reliability, we generated simulated datasets under controlled statistical settings and benchmarked performance against Boruta and Knockoff-based methods, observing consistently stronger recovery of meaningful signal. As a demonstration of practical utility, we applied the technique across diverse real-world datasets, where it surpassed feature selection techniques including Boruta, RFE, and Extra Trees. Hence, the method emerges as a robust algorithm for principled feature selection, enabling the distillation of informative predictors that support reliable inference, enhanced predictive performance, and efficient computation.

TL;DR: 论文认为DNN实现了计算奥卡姆剃刀原理——找到拟合数据的最简单算法，这解释了其相对于传统统计方法的成功。通过HTMC范数和ResNet范数的关系，表明最小化ResNet范数等价于找到节点数几乎最优的电路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释深度神经网络(DNN)相比传统统计方法取得巨大成功的原因，提出DNN实现了计算奥卡姆剃刀原理，即找到拟合数据的最简单算法。

Method: 定义HTMC范数（在γ>2时函数集合凸化）和ResNet范数（参数的加权ℓ1范数），建立两个范数之间的近似匹配三明治界，证明最小化ResNet范数等价于找到节点数几乎最优的电路。

Result: HTMC范数和ResNet范数之间存在几乎匹配的界限关系，表明ResNets在HTMC机制下是计算实函数的替代模型，更适合该机制及其凸性特性。

Conclusion: ResNets作为计算实函数的替代模型，在HTMC机制下表现更好，最小化ResNet范数相当于找到节点数几乎最优的电路，这支持了DNN实现计算奥卡姆剃刀的观点。

Abstract: This paper argues that DNNs implement a computational Occam's razor -- finding the `simplest' algorithm that fits the data -- and that this could explain their incredible and wide-ranging success over more traditional statistical methods. We start with the discovery that the set of real-valued function $f$ that can be $ε$-approximated with a binary circuit of size at most $cε^{-γ}$ becomes convex in the `Harder than Monte Carlo' (HTMC) regime, when $γ>2$, allowing for the definition of a HTMC norm on functions. In parallel one can define a complexity measure on the parameters of a ResNets (a weighted $\ell_1$ norm of the parameters), which induce a `ResNet norm' on functions. The HTMC and ResNet norms can then be related by an almost matching sandwich bound. Thus minimizing this ResNet norm is equivalent to finding a circuit that fits the data with an almost minimal number of nodes (within a power of 2 of being optimal). ResNets thus appear as an alternative model for computation of real functions, better adapted to the HTMC regime and its convexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统在不确定时经常静默失败，需要开发具有理论保证的校准方法来提高决策可靠性。

Method: 使用Fisher-Rao度量将概率向量建模为概率单纯形上的点，开发Additive Log-Ratio校准映射，构建基于Fisher-Rao距离的几何可靠性评分和中性区域。

Result: 在腺相关病毒分类任务中，两阶段框架（校准后基于可靠性延迟）捕获72.5%的错误，同时延迟34.5%的样本。校准估计器具有O_p(n^{-1/2})的一致性收敛率。

Conclusion: 该工作连接了信息几何和统计学习，为需要严格验证的应用提供了形式化保证，几何校准的价值在于其理论基础而非对简单方法的经验优势。

Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence systems make critical decisions yet often fail silently when uncertain. We develop a geometric framework for post-hoc calibration of neural network probability outputs, treating probability vectors as points on the $(c-1)$-dimensional probability simplex equipped with the Fisher--Rao metric. Our approach yields Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) calibration maps that reduce exactly to Platt scaling for binary problems (Proposition~1) while extending naturally to multi-class settings -- providing a principled generalization that existing methods lack. Complementing calibration, we define geometric reliability scores based on Fisher--Rao distance and construct neutral zones for principled deferral of uncertain predictions.
  Theoretical contributions include: (i) consistency of the calibration estimator at rate $O_p(n^{-1/2})$ via M-estimation theory (Theorem~1), and (ii) tight concentration bounds for reliability scores with explicit sub-Gaussian parameters enabling sample size calculations for validation set design (Theorem~2). We conjecture Neyman--Pearson optimality of our neutral zone construction based on connections to Bhattacharyya coefficients. Empirical validation on Adeno-Associated Virus classification demonstrates that the two-stage framework (calibration followed by reliability-based deferral) captures 72.5\% of errors while deferring 34.5\% of samples. Notably, this operational gain is achievable with any well-calibrated probability output; the contribution of geometric calibration lies in its theoretical foundations rather than empirical superiority over simpler alternatives. This work bridges information geometry and statistical learning, offering formal guarantees relevant to applications requiring rigorous validation.

Conclusion: 深度神经网络在部分线性模型的LAD回归中具有良好理论性质，但需要在统计准确性和计算效率之间进行权衡。松弛方法提供了更实用的计算方案，而原始方法具有更好的统计保证。

Abstract: This paper investigates the partial linear model by Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) regression. We parameterize the nonparametric term using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and formulate a penalized LAD problem for estimation. Specifically, our model exhibits the following challenges. First, the regularization term can be nonconvex and nonsmooth, necessitating the introduction of infinite dimensional variational analysis and nonsmooth analysis into the asymptotic normality discussion. Second, our network must expand (in width, sparsity level and depth) as more samples are observed, thereby introducing additional difficulties for theoretical analysis. Third, the oracle of the proposed estimator is itself defined through a ultra high-dimensional, nonconvex, and discontinuous optimization problem, which already entails substantial computational and theoretical challenges. Under such the challenges, we establish the consistency, convergence rate, and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Furthermore, we analyze the oracle problem itself and its continuous relaxation. We study the convergence of a proximal subgradient method for both formulations, highlighting their structural differences lead to distinct computational subproblems along the iterations. In particular, the relaxed formulation admits significantly cheaper proximal updates, reflecting an inherent trade-off between statistical accuracy and computational tractability.

Result: 建立了可能性变分推理的理论框架，揭示了可能性理论与概率理论在数学结构上的差异

Conclusion: 可能性变分推理为处理稀疏或不精确信息提供了鲁棒且可解释的推理框架

Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a cornerstone of modern Bayesian learning, enabling approximate inference in complex models that would otherwise be intractable. However, its formulation depends on expectations and divergences defined through high-dimensional integrals, often rendering analytical treatment impossible and necessitating heavy reliance on approximate learning and inference techniques. Possibility theory, an imprecise probability framework, allows to directly model epistemic uncertainty instead of leveraging subjective probabilities. While this framework provides robustness and interpretability under sparse or imprecise information, adapting VI to the possibilistic setting requires rethinking core concepts such as entropy and divergence, which presuppose additivity. In this work, we develop a principled formulation of possibilistic variational inference and apply it to a special class of exponential-family functions, highlighting parallels with their probabilistic counterparts and revealing the distinctive mathematical structures of possibility theory.

Abstract: A fundamental theoretical question in network analysis is to determine under which conditions community recovery is possible in polynomial time in the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). When the number $K$ of communities remains smaller than $\sqrt{n}$ --where $n$ denotes the number of nodes--, non-trivial community recovery is possible in polynomial time above, and only above, the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold, originally postulated using arguments from statistical physics.
  When $K \geq \sqrt{n}$, Chin, Mossel, Sohn, and Wein recently proved that, in the \emph{sparse regime}, community recovery in polynomial time is achievable below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths. This finding led them to postulate a new threshold for the many-communities regime $K \geq \sqrt{n}$. Subsequently, Carpentier, Giraud, and Verzelen established the failure of low-degree polynomials below this new threshold across all density regimes, and demonstrated successful recovery above the threshold in certain moderately sparse settings. While these results provide strong evidence that, in the many community setting, the computational barrier lies at the threshold proposed in~Chin et al., the question of achieving recovery above this threshold still remains open in most density regimes.
  The present work is a follow-up to~Carpentier et al., in which we prove Conjecture~1.4 stated therein by: \\ 1- Constructing a family of motifs satisfying specific structural properties; and\\ 2- Proving that community recovery is possible above the proposed threshold by counting such motifs.\\ Our results complete the picture of the computational barrier for community recovery in the SBM with $K \geq \sqrt{n}$ communities. They also indicate that, in moderately sparse regimes, the optimal algorithms appear to be fundamentally different from spectral methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于演化的因果效应估计方法，通过观察多轮干预下结果的变化来补偿缺失的网络结构信息，无需恢复确切的网络结构即可识别群体层面的因果效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂网络系统中，干预效应会溢出到其他单元，但驱动这些干扰结构的交互路径通常未被观察到。传统方法需要恢复确切的网络结构，而本文认为识别群体层面的因果效应无需如此。

Method: 采用基于演化的方法，研究结果在多个观察轮次中如何响应干预而变化。使用暴露映射视角，给出结果经验分布遵循低维递归方程的公理化特征，并识别存在此类演化映射的最小结构条件。该方法被视为分布层面的双重差分法。

Result: 治疗随机化不仅消除潜在混杂，还诱导从隐藏干扰通道的隐式采样，使得能够一致地学习异质性溢出效应。该方法在密集网络中实例化为因果消息传递，并可扩展到更一般的干扰结构。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不恢复确切网络结构的情况下识别群体层面的因果效应，但强时间趋势或内生干扰可能破坏识别。

Abstract: Causal effect estimation in networked systems is central to data-driven decision making. In such settings, interventions on one unit can spill over to others, and in complex physical or social systems, the interaction pathways driving these interference structures remain largely unobserved. We argue that for identifying population-level causal effects, it is not necessary to recover the exact network structure; instead, it suffices to characterize how those interactions contribute to the evolution of outcomes. Building on this principle, we study an evolution-based approach that investigates how outcomes change across observation rounds in response to interventions, hence compensating for missing network information. Using an exposure-mapping perspective, we give an axiomatic characterization of when the empirical distribution of outcomes follows a low-dimensional recursive equation, and identify minimal structural conditions under which such evolution mappings exist. We frame this as a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences. Rather than assuming parallel paths for individual units, it exploits parallel evolution patterns across treatment scenarios to estimate counterfactual trajectories. A key insight is that treatment randomization plays a role beyond eliminating latent confounding; it induces an implicit sampling from hidden interference channels, enabling consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects. We highlight causal message passing as an instantiation of this method in dense networks while extending to more general interference structures, including influencer networks where a small set of units drives most spillovers. Finally, we discuss the limits of this approach, showing that strong temporal trends or endogenous interference can undermine identification.
