In\nparticular, we show that it avoids some pitfalls of MMD, by being more\ndiscriminative and robust to the choice of hyperparameters.

However, because such\nheuristics are usually not optimal, much human effort and computational\nresources are wasted in carefully balancing tasks and heuristic rewards.\nTheoretically rigorous ways of incorporating heuristics rely on the idea of\n\\textit{policy invariance}, which guarantees that the performance of a policy\nobtained by maximizing heuristic rewards is the same as the optimal policy with\nrespect to the task reward. However, in practice, policy invariance doesn't\nresult in policy improvement, and such methods are known to empirically perform\npoorly. We propose a new paradigm to mitigate reward hacking and effectively\nuse heuristics based on the practical goal of maximizing policy improvement\ninstead of policy improvement.

While existing research has primarily\nconcentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter\nregularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT\nremains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two\ncore post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge\nretention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising\nseven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base\nmodel for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant\nfindings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT\ninherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to\nmulti-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the\nmodel's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).\nConversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis\nshows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought\nreasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit\nregularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.\nFinally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the\nstability and efficiency of RFT.

Nevertheless, real-world FL often faces major challenges\nincluding communication overhead during the transfer of large model parameters\nand statistical heterogeneity, arising from non-identical independent data\ndistributions across clients. In this work, we propose an FL framework that 1)\nprovides inherent interpretations using prototypes, and 2) tackles statistical\nheterogeneity by utilising lightweight adapter modules to act as compressed\nsurrogates of local models and guide clients to achieve generalisation despite\nvarying client distribution. Each client locally refines its model by aligning\nclass embeddings toward prototype representations and simultaneously adjust the\nlightweight adapter. Our approach replaces the need to communicate entire model\nweights with prototypes and lightweight adapters. This design ensures that each\nclient's model aligns with a globally shared structure while minimising\ncommunication load and providing inherent interpretations. Moreover, we\nconducted our experiments on a real-world retinal fundus image dataset, which\nprovides clinical-site information. We demonstrate inherent interpretable\ncapabilities and perform a classification task, which shows improvements in\naccuracy over baseline algorithms."}

To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps.

Over the past decade, progress in scalable\narchitectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI,\nexplainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of\ngraph learning to various challenging environments.

This perspective\nnecessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy\nand opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In\ncontrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like\noptimizer, expressed as $\\bm{x}_{t+1} = \\bm{x}_t - \\gamma_t\n\\frac{|\\bm{m}_t|}{{\\sqrt{\\bm{v}_t}+\\epsilon}} \\circ {\\rm Sign}(\\bm{m}_t)$.

This investigation is\nmotivated by multi-distribution learning, which takes the classical machine\nlearning paradigm of minimising a single risk over a (precise) probability and\nreplaces it with $\\Gamma$-maximin risk minimization over an IP. We provide\nnecessary conditions for elicitability of a IP-property. Furthermore, we\nexplain what an elicitable IP-property actually elicits through Bayes pairs --\nthe elicited IP-property is the corresponding standard property of the maximum\nBayes risk distribution."}

While prior work argues that BoN is almost optimal in reward vs KL\ntradeoffs, the effectiveness of BoN depends critically on the quality of the\nproxy reward model used for selection. For this purpose, we study BoN through a\nsmooth version known as Soft Best-of-N (SBoN) and develop a theoretical\nframework to address this gap. We analyze the scaling behaviour of BoN by\nproviding bounds on the KL divergence between the SBoN policy and the reference\npolicy, offering insights into how performance varies with the number of\nsamples. We also study the regret gap, i.e., the gap between the expected true\nreward under the optimal policy and the SBoN policy. Our theoretical and\nempirical findings show that smoothing helps SBoN mitigate reward\noveroptimization, especially when the quality of the proxy reward is low."}

We choose such a process where the degree of dependence is measured\nby mixing coefficients. As a representative example, we analyze a strictly\nstationary Markov chain, where the dependence structure is characterized by the\n\\(\\phi\\)- and \\(\\beta\\)-mixing coefficients. Under these assumptions, we derive\nprobabilistic upper bounds as well as convergence rates for both the\nexponential and polynomial decay of the mixing coefficients."}

We introduce a novel distance between measures that\ncompares them through a Schatten norm of their kernel covariance operators. We\nshow that this new distance is an integral probability metric that can be\nframed between a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and a Wasserstein distance. In\nparticular, we show that it avoids some pitfalls of MMD, by being more\ndiscriminative and robust to the choice of hyperparameters. Moreover, it\nbenefits from some compelling properties of kernel methods, that can avoid the\ncurse of dimensionality for their sample complexity. We provide an algorithm to\ncompute the distance in practice by introducing an extension of kernel matrix\nfor difference of distributions that could be of independent interest. Those\nadvantages are illustrated by robust approximate Bayesian computation under\ncontamination as well as particle flow simulations."}

The two main tasks in\nprevalence estimation are to adjust for bias, due to the prevalence in the\ntraining dataset, and to quantify the uncertainty in the estimate. The standard\nmethods used to quantify uncertainty in prevalence estimates are bootstrapping\nand Bayesian quantification methods. It is not clear which approach is ideal in\nterms of precision (i.e. the width of confidence intervals) and coverage (i.e.\nthe confidence intervals being well-calibrated). Here, we propose Precise\nQuantifier (PQ), a Bayesian quantifier that is more precise than existing\nquantifiers and with well-calibrated coverage. We discuss the theory behind PQ\nand present experiments based on simulated and real-world datasets. Through\nthese experiments, we establish the factors which influence quantification\nprecision: the discriminatory power of the underlying classifier; the size of\nthe labeled dataset used to train the quantifier; and the size of the unlabeled\ndataset for which prevalence is estimated. Our analysis provides deep insights\ninto uncertainty quantification for quantification learning."}
