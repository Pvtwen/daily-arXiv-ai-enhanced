### [1] [Rapid and Accurate Changepoint Detection of Power System Forced Oscillations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15812)
*Luke Dosiek,Akaash Karn,Frank Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用变点检测(CPD)估计电力系统数据中强迫振荡起止时间的新方法，通过手动设置PELT算法的惩罚参数，显著减少计算时间而不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中PELT算法自动调优惩罚参数导致计算时间长，需要改进以提升效率。

Method: 使用PELT算法进行变点检测，但手动提供惩罚参数而非自动调优，同时减少输入参数数量并提供数据驱动的最小FO段长度设置方法。

Result: 在minniWECC模型测试中，计算时间减少98%，同时保持高估计精度。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了强迫振荡检测的计算效率，为机电模式仪表提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper describes a new approach for using changepoint detection (CPD) to estimate the starting and stopping times of a forced oscillation (FO) in measured power system data. As with a previous application of CPD to this problem, the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm is used. However, instead of allowing PELT to automatically tune its penalty parameter, a method of manually providing it is presented that dramatically reduces computation time without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, the new algorithm requires fewer input parameters and provides a formal, data-driven approach to setting the minimum FO segment length to consider as troublesome for an electromechanical mode meter. A low-order ARMAX representation of the minniWECC model is used to test the approach, where a 98\% reduction in computation time is enjoyed with high estimation accuracy.

*Roman Dolgopolyi,Antonis Chatzipanagiotou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 基于CNN-Transformer架构的EEG情绪分类模型，使用5个电极实现91%准确率，支持低成本家用脑电设备部署


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发可访问的家用情绪监测系统，解决传统行为线索（如面部表情、语调）在临床或护理环境中受限或难以解释的问题

Method: 使用CNN-Transformer混合架构，融合SEED、SEED-FRA、SEED-GER数据集（1455个样本），仅需5个电极而非传统的62个

Conclusion: 该技术为媒体内容引发的情绪变化研究奠定基础，可集成到医疗、健康和家庭健康平台，实现连续被动情绪监测，有望改变心理健康诊断和干预方式

Abstract: An advanced emotion classification model was developed using a CNN-Transformer architecture for emotion recognition from EEG brain wave signals, effectively distinguishing among three emotional states, positive, neutral and negative. The model achieved a testing accuracy of 91%, outperforming traditional models such as SVM, DNN, and Logistic Regression. Training was conducted on a custom dataset created by merging data from SEED, SEED-FRA, and SEED-GER repositories, comprising 1,455 samples with EEG recordings labeled according to emotional states. The combined dataset represents one of the largest and most culturally diverse collections available. Additionally, the model allows for the reduction of the requirements of the EEG apparatus, by leveraging only 5 electrodes of the 62. This reduction demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a more affordable consumer-grade EEG headset, thereby enabling accessible, at-home use, while also requiring less computational power. This advancement sets the groundwork for future exploration into mood changes induced by media content consumption, an area that remains underresearched. Integration into medical, wellness, and home-health platforms could enable continuous, passive emotional monitoring, particularly beneficial in clinical or caregiving settings where traditional behavioral cues, such as facial expressions or vocal tone, are diminished, restricted, or difficult to interpret, thus potentially transforming mental health diagnostics and interventions...

### [3] [Integrated Coexistence for Satellite and Terrestrial Networks with Multistatic ISAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15947)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G时代LEO卫星通信与地面ISAC的紧密集成面临频谱共享带来的严重干扰问题，需要解决实际CSI获取的挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段结构：预优化和精细化，利用卫星CSI的可预测性；提出地面波束成形与卫星功率分配的协同设计方法；设计多静态ISAC的目标-雷达关联方法。

Result: 仿真结果显示该方法显著提升了集成网络性能，随着波束数量和雷达接收器增加，整体性能接近无干扰基准。

Conclusion: 证明了卫星与地面网络频谱共存的可行性，为6G集成网络提供了实用的合作框架。

Abstract: Tightly integrated low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications and terrestrial integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are expected to be key novel aspects of the 6G era. Spectrum sharing between satellite and terrestrial cellular networks may, however, cause severe interference. This paper introduces a cooperation framework for integrated coexistence between satellite and terrestrial networks where the terrestrial network also deploys multistatic ISAC. Unlike prior works that assume ideal channel state information (CSI) acquisition, the proposed approach develops a practical structure consisting of pre-optimization and refinement stages that leverages the predictability of satellite CSI. In addition, a co-design of terrestrial beamforming and satellite power allocation utilizing a weighted minimum mean-squared error algorithm is proposed, and a target-radar association method designed for multistatic ISAC is presented. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly enhances the performance of these integrated networks. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the overall performance approaches the interference-free benchmark as the number of spot beams and radar receivers increases, demonstrating the feasibility of spectral coexistence between the two networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IMU系统需要用户特定适配，相机方法侵犯隐私，因此开发一种舒适、无需调整且保护隐私的下半身运动捕捉系统。

Method: 在裤子中集成导电纺织贴片和紧凑采集单元，使用轻量级Transformer深度学习模型将电容信号映射到关节角度。

Result: 模型在11名参与者16种日常和锻炼动作上，平均关节位置误差11.96cm，平均关节角度误差12.3度，性能优于现有纺织基架构，参数减少22倍，FLOPs减少18倍，在智能手表上实时推理42FPS。

Conclusion: VersaPants为健身、医疗和健康应用提供了可扩展、舒适且可嵌入的运动捕捉解决方案。

Abstract: We present VersaPants, the first loose-fitting, textile-based capacitive sensing system for lower-body motion capture, built on the open-hardware VersaSens platform. By integrating conductive textile patches and a compact acquisition unit into a pair of pants, the system reconstructs lower-body pose without compromising comfort. Unlike IMU-based systems that require user-specific fitting or camera-based methods that compromise privacy, our approach operates without fitting adjustments and preserves user privacy. VersaPants is a custom-designed smart garment featuring 6 capacitive channels per leg. We employ a lightweight Transformer-based deep learning model that maps capacitance signals to joint angles, enabling embedded implementation on edge platforms. To test our system, we collected approximately 3.7 hours of motion data from 11 participants performing 16 daily and exercise-based movements. The model achieves a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 11.96 cm and a mean per-joint angle error (MPJAE) of 12.3 degrees across the hip, knee, and ankle joints, indicating the model's ability to generalize to unseen users and movements. A comparative analysis of existing textile-based deep learning architectures reveals that our model achieves competitive reconstruction performance with up to 22 times fewer parameters and 18 times fewer FLOPs, enabling real-time inference at 42 FPS on a commercial smartwatch without quantization. These results position VersaPants as a promising step toward scalable, comfortable, and embedded motion-capture solutions for fitness, healthcare, and wellbeing applications.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖l1范数近似和交替优化技术，存在计算复杂度高、缺乏鲁棒收敛保证的问题。

Method: 使用sigmoid函数近似l0范数准入控制指标，引入惩罚对偶分解算法联合优化波束成形和准入控制。

Result: 相比现有方法，实现了更低的功耗、容纳更多用户、减少计算时间，并支持分布式实现。

Conclusion: 该方法能够收敛到平稳解，在计算复杂度和性能方面均优于传统方法。

Abstract: Joint admission control and power minimization are critical challenges in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted networks. Traditional methods often rely on \( l_1 \)-norm approximations and alternating optimization (AO) techniques, which suffer from high computational complexity and lack robust convergence guarantees. To address these limitations, we propose a sigmoid-based approximation of the \( l_0 \)-norm AC indicator, enabling a more efficient and tractable reformulation of the problem. Additionally, we introduce a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm to jointly optimize beamforming and admission control, ensuring convergence to a stationary solution. This approach reduces computational complexity and supports distributed implementation. Moreover, it outperforms existing methods by achieving lower power consumption, accommodating more users, and reducing computational time.

Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder that is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality. While existing diagnostic approaches can roughly classify OSA severity or detect isolated respiratory events, they lack the precision and comprehensiveness required for high resolution, event level diagnosis. Here, we present UT OSANet, a deep learning based model designed as a event level, multi scenario diagnostic tool for OSA. This model facilitates detailed identification of events associated with OSA, including apnea, hypopnea, oxygen desaturation, and arousal. Moreover, the model employs flexibly adjustable input modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG), airflow, and SpO 2. It utilizes a random masked modality combination training strategy, allowing it to comprehend cross-modal relationships while sustaining consistent performance across varying modality conditions. This model was trained and evaluated utilizing 9,021 polysomnography (PSG) recordings from five independent datasets. achieving sensitivities up to 0.93 and macro F1 scores of 0.84, 0.85 across home, clinical, and research scenarios. This model serves as an event-level, multi-scenario diagnostic instrument for real-world applications of OSA, while also establishing itself as a means to deepen the mechanistic comprehension of respiratory processes in sleep disorders and their extensive health implications.

Conclusion: 这项研究对于实现实用且可扩展的量子增强通信系统至关重要，为里德堡阵列的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers have been seen as novel radio frequency measurements and the high sensitivity to a large range of frequencies makes it attractive for communications reception. However, current implementations of Rydberg array antennas predominantly rely on simple stacking of multiple single-antenna units. While conceptually straightforward, this approach leads to substantial system bulkiness due to the unique requirements of atomic sensors, particularly the need for multiple spatially separated laser setups, rendering such designs both impractical for real-world applications and challenging to fabricate. This limitation underscores the critical need for developing multiplexed Rydberg sensor array architectures. In the domain of conventional RF array antennas, hybrid analog-digital beamforming has emerged as a pivotal architecture for large-scale millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, as it substantially reduces the hardware complexity associated with fully-digital beamforming while closely approaching its performance. Drawing inspiration from this methodology, we conduct a systematic study in this work on the design principles, equivalent modeling, and precoding strategies for low-complexity multiplexed Rydberg array, an endeavor crucial to enabling practical and scalable quantum-enhanced communication systems.

### [8] [Dynamic Multiple-Parameter Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform and its Intelligent Filtering Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16277)
*Manjun Cui,Ziqi Yan,Yangfan He,Zhichao Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出动态多参数联合时间-顶点分数傅里叶变换(DMPJFRFT)，通过引入时变分数参数实现动态图结构的自适应谱建模，在去噪和去模糊任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联合时间-顶点变换只能为空间域和时间域各分配一个分数阶，限制了建模图信号复杂动态变化的能力。

Method: 提出DMPJFRFT框架，为每个时间步分配不同的分数阶，实现动态灵活的时空信号表示；开发了基于梯度下降和神经网络的两种滤波方法用于动态信号恢复。

Result: 在动态图和视频数据集上的实验表明，该框架能有效捕捉时间拓扑变化，在去噪和去模糊任务中优于最先进的图基变换和神经网络。

Conclusion: DMPJFRFT通过时变分数参数实现了对动态图结构的自适应谱建模，为动态图信号处理提供了更灵活有效的工具。

Abstract: Dynamic graph signal processing provides a principled framework for analyzing time-varying data defined on irregular graph domains. However, existing joint time-vertex transforms such as the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform assign only one fractional order to the spatial domain and another one to the temporal domain, thereby restricting their capacity to model the complex and continuously varying dynamics of graph signals. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dynamic multiple-parameter joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (DMPJFRFT) framework, which introduces time-varying fractional parameters to achieve adaptive spectral modeling of dynamic graph structures. By assigning distinct fractional orders to each time step, the proposed transform enables dynamic and flexible representation of spatio-temporal signal evolution in the joint time-vertex spectral domain. Theoretical properties of the DMPJFRFT are systematically analyzed, and two filtering approaches: a gradient descent-based method and a neural network-based method, are developed for dynamic signal restoration. Experimental results on dynamic graph and video datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively captures temporal topology variations and achieves superior performance in denoising and deblurring tasks compared with some state-of-the-art graph-based transforms and neural networks.

Abstract: A joint communication and computation (JCC) framework using segmented pinching antenna system (PASS) is proposed, where both the communication bit streams and computation data are simultaneously transmitted via uplink communications. The segmented PASS design is used to yield the tractable uplink transmission, and to mitigate large-scale path loss and in-waveguide loss. Based on three operating protocols, namely segment selection (SS), segment aggregation (SA), and segment multiplexing (SM), the joint transmit and receive beamforming problem is formulated: 1) The mean square error (MSE) minimization problem is formulated for computation-oriented cases. To address this problem, a low-complexity alternating optimization-minimum mean square error (AO-MMSE) algorithm is developed. This problem is decomposed into receiver-side and transmitter-side MSE subproblems that are iteratively optimized by MMSE receivers to obtain the closed-form solutions. It is mathematically proved that the segmented JCC-PASS framework significantly outperforms the conventional PASS for the average in-waveguide propagation gain. 2) The weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem is formulated for communication-oriented cases. To solve the decomposed receiver-side and transmitter-side MSE subproblems, the AO-weighted minimum mean square error (AO-WMMSE) algorithm is further developed. An auxiliary weight variable is introduced to linearize the WSR function and is alternatively optimized based on WMMSE to derive the closed-form solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed JCC-PASS framework achieves up to 70.65% and 45.32% reductions in MSE compared with conventional MIMO and conventional PASS, and ii) it reaches 87.70% and 51.35% improvements in WSR compared with conventional MIMO and conventional PASS, respectively.

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI)-based user equipment (UE) positioning with neural networks -- referred to as neural positioning -- is a promising approach for accurate off-device UE localization. Most existing methods train their neural networks with ground-truth position labels obtained from external reference positioning systems, which requires costly hardware and renders label acquisition difficult in large areas. In this work, we propose a novel neural positioning pipeline that avoids the need for any external reference positioning system. Our approach trains the positioning network only using CSI acquired off-device and relative displacement commands executed on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) robot platforms, such as robotic vacuum cleaners -- such an approach enables inexpensive training of accurate neural positioning functions over large areas. We evaluate our method in three real-world scenarios, ranging from small line-of-sight (LoS) areas to larger non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments, using CSI measurements acquired in IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi and 5G New Radio (NR) systems. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed neural positioning pipeline achieves UE localization accuracies close to state-of-the-art methods that require externally acquired high-precision ground-truth position labels for training.

Abstract: Recent advances in Wireless Physical Layer Foundation Models (WPFMs) promise a new paradigm of universal Radio Frequency (RF) representations. However, these models inherit critical limitations found in deep learning such as the lack of explainability, robustness, adaptability, and verifiable compliance with physical and regulatory constraints. In addition, the vision for an AI-native 6G network demands a level of intelligence that is deeply embedded into the systems and is trustworthy. In this vision paper, we argue that the neuro-symbolic paradigm, which integrates data-driven neural networks with rule- and logic-based symbolic reasoning, is essential for bridging this gap. We envision a novel Neuro-Symbolic framework that integrates universal RF embeddings with symbolic knowledge graphs and differentiable logic layers. This hybrid approach enables models to learn from large datasets while reasoning over explicit domain knowledge, enabling trustworthy, generalizable, and efficient wireless AI that can meet the demands of future networks.

Abstract: Very wideband apertures are needed in positioning, sensing, spectrum monitoring, and modern spread spectrum, e.g., frequency hopping systems. Vivaldi antennas are one of the prominent choices for the aforementioned systems due to their natural wideband characteristics. Furthermore, tightly-coupled antenna arrays have been researched in the recent years to extend the lower band edge of compact arrays by taking advantage of the strong mutual coupling between the elements especially with dipole elements, but not with dual-polarized Vivaldi antennas. This paper presents a novel tightly-coupled dual-polarized antipodal Vivaldi antenna (TC-AVA) with -6 dB impedance bandwidth of 3 to 20 GHz. The tight coupling by overlapping the Vivaldi leaves is shown to extend the lower band edge from 3.75 to 3 GHz and 2.75 GHz, an improvement of 20% to 25% for both polarizations, compared with an isolated antipodal Vivaldi element.

Abstract: Ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) readings are prone to mixed noise from physical activities, including baseline wander (BW), muscle artifact (MA), and electrode motion artifact (EM). Developing a method to remove such complex noise and reconstruct high-fidelity signals is clinically valuable for diagnostic accuracy. However, denoising of multi-beat ECG segments remains understudied and poses technical challenges. To address this, we propose Time-Frequency Complementary Diffusion (TFCDiff), a novel approach that operates in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain and uses the DCT coefficients of noisy signals as conditioning input. To refine waveform details, we incorporate Temporal Feature Enhancement Mechanism (TFEM) to reinforce temporal representations and preserve key physiological information. Comparative experiments on a synthesized dataset demonstrate that TFCDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across five evaluation metrics. Furthermore, TFCDiff shows superior generalization on the unseen SimEMG Database, outperforming all benchmark models. Notably, TFCDiff processes raw 10-second sequences and maintains robustness under flexible random mixed noise (fRMN), enabling plug-and-play deployment in wearable ECG monitors for high-motion scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放受限于基础模型的有限上下文长度，远小于训练时的token数量，需要扩展测试时推理能力。

Method: 提出3D测试时缩放框架，结合上下文长度缩放、批处理缩放（并行采样提升准确率）和轮次缩放（迭代自优化提升推理质量）。

Conclusion: 三维测试时缩放框架能有效扩展推理能力，并可自然扩展到具身学习等开放领域，实现人形控制行为设计。

Abstract: Reasoning reinforcement learning (RL) has recently revealed a new scaling effect: test-time scaling. Thinking models such as R1 and o1 improve their reasoning accuracy at test time as the length of the reasoning context increases. However, compared with training-time scaling, test-time scaling is fundamentally limited by the limited context length of base models, which remains orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of tokens consumed during training. We revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality. Building on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling. We show that: (1) each dimension demonstrates a test-time scaling effect, but with a bounded capacity; (2) combining all three dimensions substantially improves the reasoning performance of challenging testbeds, including IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and further benefits from human preference feedback; and (3) the human-in-the-loop framework naturally extends to a more open-ended domain, i.e., embodied learning, which enables the design of humanoid control behaviors.

Abstract: Operational forecasting of the ionosphere remains a critical space weather challenge due to sparse observations, complex coupling across geospatial layers, and a growing need for timely, accurate predictions that support Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), communications, aviation safety, as well as satellite operations. As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions. This work presents an extensive dataset and modeling pipeline that enables exploration of not only ionospheric dynamics but also broader Sun-Earth interactions, supporting both scientific inquiry and operational forecasting efforts.

### [16] [Optimizing Operation Recipes with Reinforcement Learning for Safe and Interpretable Control of Chemical Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16297)
*Dean Brandner,Sergio Lucia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种结合专家知识和强化学习的方法来优化化工过程操作，通过优化操作配方参数和线性控制器，在数据需求少、约束处理更好、可解释性更强的条件下实现接近最优控制的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化工过程优化对节能降耗至关重要，但传统强化学习方法面临硬约束难以满足、训练数据需求大的挑战，而详细动态模型又计算复杂。现有方法多依赖人工定义的操作配方，导致性能次优且灵活性有限。

Method: 利用操作配方中嵌入的专家知识，使用强化学习优化配方参数和底层线性控制器，生成优化的操作配方。该方法具有结构化特性，数据需求少且约束处理更有效。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过结合专家知识和强化学习，为化工过程优化提供了一种数据需求少、约束处理强、可解释性高的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Optimal operation of chemical processes is vital for energy, resource, and cost savings in chemical engineering. The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data. Optimal control methods, such as model predictive control, also struggle with the complexity of the underlying dynamic models. Consequently, many chemical processes rely on manually defined operation recipes combined with simple linear controllers, leading to suboptimal performance and limited flexibility.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages expert knowledge embedded in operation recipes. By using reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of these recipes and their underlying linear controllers, we achieve an optimized operation recipe. This method requires significantly less data, handles constraints more effectively, and is more interpretable than traditional reinforcement learning methods due to the structured nature of the recipes. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through simulation results of an industrial batch polymerization reactor, showing that it can approach the performance of optimal controllers while addressing the limitations of existing methods.

### [17] [Beyond Tsybakov: Model Margin Noise and $\mathcal{H}$-Consistency Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15816)
*Mehryar Mohri,Yutao Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的低噪声条件——模型边界噪声(MM噪声)假设，并在该条件下推导了增强的H-一致性边界。MM噪声比Tsybakov噪声条件更弱，能够产生更好的H-一致性边界，并在中间噪声水平下在线性和平方根机制之间平滑插值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Tsybakov噪声条件可能过于严格，需要一种更弱的噪声假设来获得更好的H-一致性边界。MM噪声假设依赖于给定假设与贝叶斯分类器之间的差异，而不是内在分布最小边界。

Method: 引入模型边界噪声(MM噪声)假设，该假设比Tsybakov噪声条件更弱但能产生相同有利指数的增强H-一致性边界。将结果实例化到常见的替代损失函数族。

Result: 获得了在MM噪声条件下的增强H-一致性边界，这些边界在中间噪声水平下在线性和平方根机制之间平滑插值。为常见替代损失函数族提供了具体边界实例。

Conclusion: MM噪声假设为分类问题提供了一个更弱但有效的低噪声条件，能够推导出改进的H-一致性边界，扩展了现有理论结果并提供了实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce a new low-noise condition for classification, the Model Margin Noise (MM noise) assumption, and derive enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds under this condition. MM noise is weaker than Tsybakov noise condition: it is implied by Tsybakov noise condition but can hold even when Tsybakov fails, because it depends on the discrepancy between a given hypothesis and the Bayes-classifier rather than on the intrinsic distributional minimal margin (see Figure 1 for an illustration of an explicit example). This hypothesis-dependent assumption yields enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds for both binary and multi-class classification. Our results extend the enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds of Mao, Mohri, and Zhong (2025a) with the same favorable exponents but under a weaker assumption than the Tsybakov noise condition; they interpolate smoothly between linear and square-root regimes for intermediate noise levels. We also instantiate these bounds for common surrogate loss families and provide illustrative tables.

Motivation: 硬件设计验证是最耗时和资源密集的阶段，生成有效的测试激励既关键又劳动密集，LLM为此提供了新的自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用CD-DPO方法微调LLM，通过PairaNet数据集（包含基于仿真覆盖指标标注的高质量和低质量测试平台对）进行偏好训练，将定量覆盖反馈直接集成到优化目标中。

Result: 在CVDP CID12基准测试中，TB or not TB优于开源和商业基线，代码覆盖率提升高达77.27%。

Conclusion: 覆盖驱动偏好优化对于基于LLM的硬件验证非常有效，能够生成最大化验证覆盖率的激励。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in applying them to hardware design and verification. Among these stages, design verification remains the most time-consuming and resource-intensive phase, where generating effective stimuli for the design under test (DUT) is both critical and labor-intensive. We present {\it TB or not TB}, a framework for automated stimulus generation using LLMs fine-tuned through Coverage-Driven Direct Preference Optimization (CD-DPO). To enable preference-based training, we introduce PairaNet, a dataset derived from PyraNet that pairs high- and low-quality testbenches labeled using simulation-derived coverage metrics. The proposed CD-DPO method integrates quantitative coverage feedback directly into the optimization objective, guiding the model toward generating stimuli that maximize verification coverage. Experiments on the CVDP CID12 benchmark show that {\it TB or not TB} outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines, achieving up to 77.27\% improvement in code coverage, demonstrating the effectiveness of Coverage-driven preference optimization for LLM-based hardware verification.

Abstract: Scalable Gaussian process (GP) inference is essential for sequential decision-making tasks, yet improving GP scalability remains a challenging problem with many open avenues of research. This paper focuses on iterative GPs, where iterative linear solvers, such as conjugate gradients, stochastic gradient descent or alternative projections, are used to approximate the GP posterior. We propose a new method which improves solver convergence of a large linear system by leveraging the known solution to a smaller system contained within. This is significant for tasks with incremental data additions, and we show that our technique achieves speed-ups when solving to tolerance, as well as improved Bayesian optimisation performance under a fixed compute budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性扰动的文本图像可能导致OCR系统产生误导性转录，现有防御方法存在模型特定、计算昂贵、影响正常输入性能等局限性。

Method: 采用拓扑自编码器，利用拓扑特征在潜在空间中强制执行流形级别的一致性，无需显式梯度正则化。

Result: 在EMNIST、MNIST数据集上对标准对抗攻击、自适应攻击和OCR特定水印攻击进行了基准测试。

Conclusion: TopoReformer提供了一种有效的对抗性防御方法，能够保持文本结构完整性并提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarially perturbed images of text can cause sophisticated OCR systems to produce misleading or incorrect transcriptions from seemingly invisible changes to humans. Some of these perturbations even survive physical capture, posing security risks to high-stakes applications such as document processing, license plate recognition, and automated compliance systems. Existing defenses, such as adversarial training, input preprocessing, or post-recognition correction, are often model-specific, computationally expensive, and affect performance on unperturbed inputs while remaining vulnerable to unseen or adaptive attacks. To address these challenges, TopoReformer is introduced, a model-agnostic reformation pipeline that mitigates adversarial perturbations while preserving the structural integrity of text images. Topology studies properties of shapes and spaces that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, focusing on global structures such as connectivity, holes, and loops rather than exact distance. Leveraging these topological features, TopoReformer employs a topological autoencoder to enforce manifold-level consistency in latent space and improve robustness without explicit gradient regularization. The proposed method is benchmarked on EMNIST, MNIST, against standard adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner), adaptive attacks (EOT, BDPA), and an OCR-specific watermark attack (FAWA).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 策略梯度方法虽然有效，但往往因梯度估计的高方差导致性能不稳定、收敛缓慢，需要提高可靠性和效率。

Method: 提出奖励分析框架，基于高置信度的性能估计选择性更新策略，理论上不会减慢基线方法的收敛速度。

Result: 在8个连续控制基准测试中，收敛速度提升1.5倍，回报方差在某些设置下减少1.75倍。

Conclusion: 该分析框架为复杂环境中更可靠和高效的策略学习提供了通用且理论上有依据的路径。

Abstract: Policy gradient methods, which have been extensively studied in the last decade, offer an effective and efficient framework for reinforcement learning problems. However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种优化本地差分隐私机制的设计方法，旨在减少数据不公平性并改善下游分类的公平性。通过推导闭式最优机制和开发可处理的优化框架，建立了隐私感知预处理与分类公平性之间的直接联系。

Motivation: 研究如何通过本地差分隐私机制设计来减少数据不公平性，从而改善下游分类任务的公平性，同时保护敏感属性的隐私。

Method: 首先推导了二元敏感属性的闭式最优机制，然后开发了一个可处理的优化框架来获得多值属性的相应最优机制。

Result: 实证结果表明，该方法在减少数据不公平性方面始终优于现有的LDP机制，同时保持与非私有模型相近的准确性。与领先的预处理和后处理公平性方法相比，实现了更有利的准确性-公平性权衡。

Conclusion: 本地差分隐私是一种有原则且有效的预处理公平性干预技术，能够在保护敏感属性隐私的同时改善分类公平性。

Abstract: We investigate how to optimally design local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms that reduce data unfairness and thereby improve fairness in downstream classification. We first derive a closed-form optimal mechanism for binary sensitive attributes and then develop a tractable optimization framework that yields the corresponding optimal mechanism for multi-valued attributes. As a theoretical contribution, we establish that for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers, reducing data unfairness necessarily leads to lower classification unfairness, thus providing a direct link between privacy-aware pre-processing and classification fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes. Taken together, these results highlight LDP as a principled and effective pre-processing fairness intervention technique.

*Poushali Sengupta,Yan Zhang,Frank Eliassen,Sabita Maharjan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ExCIR和BlockCIR两种相关性感知的归因方法，通过稳健中心化和分组处理解决现有全局归因方法计算成本高、稳定性差和扩展性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型复杂度增加和高风险应用对透明度的需求，现有全局归因方法存在计算成本高、在相关输入下缺乏稳定性、难以扩展到大型异构数据集的问题。

Method: ExCIR通过稳健中心化（减去中位数或中均值）量化特征与模型输出之间的符号对齐共变，并引入轻量级传输协议；BlockCIR是ExCIR的分组扩展，将相关特征集作为单个单元评分，避免共线性簇中的重复计算。

Result: 在文本、表格、信号和图像数据集上，ExCIR与现有基线方法一致，提供稳定的top-k排名，并通过在数据子集上的轻量级评估减少运行时间。

Conclusion: ExCIR为实际部署提供了计算高效、一致且可扩展的可解释性解决方案。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is increasingly essential as modern models become more complex and high-stakes applications demand transparency, trust, and regulatory compliance. Existing global attribution methods often incur high computational costs, lack stability under correlated inputs, and fail to scale efficiently to large or heterogeneous datasets. We address these gaps with \emph{ExCIR} (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a correlation-aware attribution score equipped with a lightweight transfer protocol that reproduces full-model rankings using only a fraction of the data. ExCIR quantifies sign-aligned co-movement between features and model outputs after \emph{robust centering} (subtracting a robust location estimate, e.g., median or mid-mean, from features and outputs). We further introduce \textsc{BlockCIR}, a \emph{groupwise} extension of ExCIR that scores \emph{sets} of correlated features as a single unit. By aggregating the same signed-co-movement numerators and magnitudes over predefined or data-driven groups, \textsc{BlockCIR} mitigates double-counting in collinear clusters (e.g., synonyms or duplicated sensors) and yields smoother, more stable rankings when strong dependencies are present. Across diverse text, tabular, signal, and image datasets, ExCIR shows trustworthy agreement with established global baselines and the full model, delivers consistent top-$k$ rankings across settings, and reduces runtime via lightweight evaluation on a subset of rows. Overall, ExCIR provides \emph{computationally efficient}, \emph{consistent}, and \emph{scalable} explainability for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: AFOCP是一种改进的在线保形预测方法，通过特征空间操作和注意力机制，在保持覆盖率的同时显著减小预测区间大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准在线保形预测存在两个关键限制：在输出空间使用简单的不符合性分数，以及统一处理所有历史观测值进行分位数估计。

Method: AFOCP引入两个关键创新：1) 在预训练神经网络的特征空间操作，利用学习到的表示构建更紧凑的预测集；2) 使用注意力机制自适应加权历史观测值。

Result: 在合成和真实世界时间序列数据集上的实验表明，AFOCP相比标准OCP能将预测区间大小减少高达88%，同时保持目标覆盖率水平。

Conclusion: AFOCP通过特征空间校准和基于注意力的自适应加权，有效解决了标准OCP的局限性，在非平稳性和分布偏移情况下提供更紧凑的预测集。

Abstract: Online conformal prediction (OCP) wraps around any pre-trained predictor to produce prediction sets with coverage guarantees that hold irrespective of temporal dependencies or distribution shifts. However, standard OCP faces two key limitations: it operates in the output space using simple nonconformity (NC) scores, and it treats all historical observations uniformly when estimating quantiles. This paper introduces attention-based feature OCP (AFOCP), which addresses both limitations through two key innovations. First, AFOCP operates in the feature space of pre-trained neural networks, leveraging learned representations to construct more compact prediction sets by concentrating on task-relevant information while suppressing nuisance variation. Second, AFOCP incorporates an attention mechanism that adaptively weights historical observations based on their relevance to the current test point, effectively handling non-stationarity and distribution shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that AFOCP maintains long-term coverage while provably achieving smaller prediction intervals than standard OCP under mild regularity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that AFOCP consistently reduces the size of prediction intervals by as much as $88\%$ as compared to OCP, while maintaining target coverage levels, validating the benefits of both feature-space calibration and attention-based adaptive weighting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验面临患者群体分散、招募缓慢和成本高昂等挑战，特别是在肿瘤学和罕见病领域。现有基于真实世界数据的外部控制臂方法存在局限，需要更好的合成控制臂生成方法。

Method: 使用变分自编码器在统一潜变量框架下联合生成混合类型协变量和生存结局，不假设独立删失，并提出了生成后选择程序来改善校准。

Conclusion: 该方法在生成生存模型方面取得进展，但也突出了开放挑战，特别是在校准改进方面需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Clinical trials face mounting challenges: fragmented patient populations, slow enrollment, and unsustainable costs, particularly for late phase trials in oncology and rare diseases. While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power. We propose a post-generation selection procedure that improves calibration, highlighting both progress and open challenges for generative survival modeling.

Result: 在MIMIC-III基准测试中，多模态集成方法相比最佳单模型显著提升了区分能力（AUPRC 0.565 vs 0.526；AUROC 0.891 vs 0.876），并保持良好校准。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持竞争力的同时，提供了可靠、可审计的风险估计和透明、可预测的操作，这对临床应用至关重要。

Abstract: Early identification of intensive care patients at risk of in-hospital mortality enables timely intervention and efficient resource allocation. Despite high predictive performance, existing machine learning approaches lack transparency and robustness, limiting clinical adoption. We present a lightweight, transparent multimodal ensemble that fuses physiological time-series measurements with unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability: feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision. On the MIMIC-III benchmark, our late-fusion ensemble improves discrimination over the best single model (AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526; AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876) while maintaining well-calibrated predictions. The system remains robust through a calibrated fallback when a modality is missing. These results demonstrate competitive performance with reliable, auditable risk estimates and transparent, predictable operation, which together are crucial for clinical use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECP算法虽然能确保每次函数评估都提供信息，但存在计算成本高和早期行为过于保守的问题，需要开发更高效实用的优化算法。

Method: ECPv2引入三个关键技术：(1)自适应下界避免无效接受区域，(2)Worst-m记忆机制限制与固定大小历史评估子集的比较，(3)固定随机投影加速高维距离计算。

Result: 理论证明ECPv2保持ECP的无悔保证和最优有限时间边界，实验验证在多种高维非凸优化问题中，ECPv2始终匹配或优于最先进的优化器，同时显著减少计算时间。

Conclusion: ECPv2是一个理论严谨且实用的全局优化算法，在保持理论保证的同时显著提升了计算效率和实际性能。

Abstract: We propose ECPv2, a scalable and theoretically grounded algorithm for global optimization of Lipschitz-continuous functions with unknown Lipschitz constants. Building on the Every Call is Precious (ECP) framework, which ensures that each accepted function evaluation is potentially informative, ECPv2 addresses key limitations of ECP, including high computational cost and overly conservative early behavior. ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability. We further empirically validate these findings through extensive experiments and ablation studies. Using principled hyperparameter settings, we evaluate ECPv2 across a wide range of high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problems. Across benchmarks, ECPv2 consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, while significantly reducing wall-clock time.

GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.
  On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the "Full" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the "Scarce" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.
  In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.
  These results show that rigorous physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases can achieve large gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE).

Conclusion: 本文首次提供了具有高接受率和低开销的多草稿推测采样算法，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative sampling reduces the latency of autoregressive decoding for target model LLMs without sacrificing inference quality, by using a cheap draft model to suggest a candidate token and a verification criterion to accept or resample this token. To improve acceptance and decoding efficiency, recent work has explored the multi-draft extension, where at each step $n$ draft tokens are generated, and the verification criterion is a distribution conditioned on these. When this criterion maximizes the probability of accepting some draft token, it is called the optimal transport (OT). However, finding the OT is difficult, as it is the solution of a linear program (OTLP) in over $V^n$ variables, with $V$ being the vocabulary size. Two recent theoretical works have reframed the OTLP in terms of importance sampling or subset selection. In this work, we prove that these formulations are equivalent to an exponentially large relaxed OTLP, so it remains infeasible to solve. Then, we reverse engineer subset selection to formulate the OTLP as a max-flow problem. With a novel application of polymatroid theory, we reduce the exponentially large OTLP to a convex optimization problem in at most $V$ variables. This allows us to devise an algorithm for optimal $n$-draft speculative sampling when the $n$ tokens are chosen i.i.d. from a single draft model, which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy. Finally, we measure acceptance rates and algorithm runtimes for various $n$ and top-$k$ draft sampling settings. Our findings give the first multi-draft algorithm with 90% acceptance and under 100 ms of overhead per generated token with negligible deviation from the target model distribution.

Abstract: Generative models for structure-based drug design are often limited to a specific modality, restricting their broader applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures. As a final contribution, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for structure-conditioned macrocyclic peptide generation. The code is available at https://github.com/prescient-design/funcbind.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive generation, yet their reliance on Transformer backbones limits inference efficiency due to quadratic attention and KV-cache overhead. In this work, we introduce DiffuApriel, a masked diffusion language model built on a bidirectional Mamba backbone that combines the diffusion objective with linear-time sequence modeling. DiffuApriel matches the performance of Transformer-based diffusion models while achieving up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences with a 1.3B model. We further propose DiffuApriel-H, a hybrid variant that interleaves attention and mamba layers, offering up to 2.6x throughput improvement with balanced global and local context modeling. Our results demonstrate that bidirectional state-space architectures serve as strong denoisers in masked diffusion LMs, providing a practical and scalable foundation for faster, memory-efficient text generation.

Abstract: Tabular data underpins decisions across science, industry, and public services. Despite rapid progress, advances in deep learning have not fully carried over to the tabular domain, where gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) remain a default choice in practice. We present iLTM, an integrated Large Tabular Model that unifies tree-derived embeddings, dimensionality-agnostic representations, a meta-trained hypernetwork, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and retrieval within a single architecture. Pretrained on more than 1,800 heterogeneous classification datasets, iLTM achieves consistently superior performance across tabular classification and regression tasks, from small datasets to large and high-dimensional tasks. After light fine-tuning, the meta-trained hypernetwork transfers to regression targets, matching or surpassing strong baselines. Extensive experiments show that iLTM outperforms well-tuned GBDTs and leading deep tabular models while requiring less task-specific tuning. By bridging the gap between tree-based and neural methods, iLTM offers a new framework for tabular foundation models for robust, adaptable, and scalable tabular learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了自适应正交多项式滤波器(AOPF)来解决谱GNN的异质性和过平滑问题，引入了L-JacobiNet和S-JacobiNet两个模型，发现[0,∞)域更适合异质性建模，而[-1,1]域在高阶时数值稳定性更好，且ChebyNet的主要问题是稳定性而非静态特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统谱GNN如ChebyNet由于使用静态低通滤波器设计，受到异质性和过平滑问题的限制，需要探索自适应滤波器解决方案。

Method: 提出了自适应正交多项式滤波器(AOPF)类，包括两个在[-1,1]域操作的模型：L-JacobiNet（ChebyNet的自适应泛化）和S-JacobiNet（LayerNorm稳定的静态ChebyNet），并与[0,∞)域的AOPF进行比较分析。

Result: [0,∞)域在建模异质性方面更优，而[-1,1]域在高阶(K>20)时提供更好的数值稳定性；静态S-JacobiNet在5个基准数据集中的4个上优于自适应L-JacobiNet。

Conclusion: ChebyNet的主要缺陷是稳定性问题而非静态特性，S-JacobiNet是一个被忽视的强大基线模型，在[-1,1]域的自适应可能导致过拟合。

Abstract: Spectral GNNs, like ChebyNet, are limited by heterophily and over-smoothing due to their static, low-pass filter design. This work investigates the "Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter" (AOPF) class as a solution. We introduce two models operating in the [-1, 1] domain: 1) `L-JacobiNet`, the adaptive generalization of `ChebyNet` with learnable alpha, beta shape parameters, and 2) `S-JacobiNet`, a novel baseline representing a LayerNorm-stabilized static `ChebyNet`. Our analysis, comparing these models against AOPFs in the [0, infty) domain (e.g., `LaguerreNet`), reveals critical, previously unknown trade-offs. We find that the [0, infty) domain is superior for modeling heterophily, while the [-1, 1] domain (Jacobi) provides superior numerical stability at high K (K>20). Most significantly, we discover that `ChebyNet`'s main flaw is stabilization, not its static nature. Our static `S-JacobiNet` (ChebyNet+LayerNorm) outperforms the adaptive `L-JacobiNet` on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets, identifying `S-JacobiNet` as a powerful, overlooked baseline and suggesting that adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain can lead to overfitting.

Conclusion: 统一的光谱潜在空间能有效利用更大、更多样化的MIR数据集，提升当前NIR库中代表性不足的土壤属性预测能力。

Abstract: We propose a self-supervised machine learning (SSML) framework for multi-fidelity learning and extended predictive soil spectroscopy based on latent space embeddings. A self-supervised representation was pretrained with the large MIR spectral library and the Variational Autoencoder algorithm to obtain a compressed latent space for generating spectral embeddings. At this stage, only unlabeled spectral data were used, allowing us to leverage the full spectral database and the availability of scan repeats for augmented training. We also leveraged and froze the trained MIR decoder for a spectrum conversion task by plugging it into a NIR encoder to learn the mapping between NIR and MIR spectra in an attempt to leverage the predictive capabilities contained in the large MIR library with a low cost portable NIR scanner. This was achieved by using a smaller subset of the KSSL library with paired NIR and MIR spectra. Downstream machine learning models were then trained to map between original spectra, predicted spectra, and latent space embeddings for nine soil properties. The performance of was evaluated independently of the KSSL training data using a gold-standard test set, along with regression goodness-of-fit metrics. Compared to baseline models, the proposed SSML and its embeddings yielded similar or better accuracy in all soil properties prediction tasks. Predictions derived from the spectrum conversion (NIR to MIR) task did not match the performance of the original MIR spectra but were similar or superior to predictive performance of NIR-only models, suggesting the unified spectral latent space can effectively leverage the larger and more diverse MIR dataset for prediction of soil properties not well represented in current NIR libraries.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks offer a principled approach to graph filtering but face a fundamental "Stability-vs-Adaptivity" trade-off. This trade-off is dictated by the choice of spectral domain. Filters in the finite [-1, 1] domain (e.g., ChebyNet) are numerically stable at high polynomial degrees (K) but are static and low-pass, causing them to fail on heterophilic graphs. Conversely, filters in the semi-infinite [0, infty) domain (e.g., KrawtchoukNet) are highly adaptive and achieve SOTA results on heterophily by learning non-low-pass responses. However, as we demonstrate, these adaptive filters can also suffer from numerical instability, leading to catastrophic performance collapse at high K. In this paper, we propose to resolve this trade-off by designing a hybrid-domain GNN, HybSpecNet, which combines a stable `ChebyNet` branch with an adaptive `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We first demonstrate that a "naive" hybrid architecture, which fuses the branches via concatenation, successfully unifies performance at low K, achieving strong results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. However, we then prove that this naive architecture fails the stability test. Our K-ablation experiments show that this architecture catastrophically collapses at K=25, exactly mirroring the collapse of its unstable `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We identify this critical finding as "Instability Poisoning," where `NaN`/`Inf` gradients from the adaptive branch destroy the training of the model. Finally, we propose and validate an advanced architecture that uses "Late Fusion" to completely isolate the gradient pathways. We demonstrate that this successfully solves the instability problem, remaining perfectly stable up to K=30 while retaining its SOTA performance across all graph types. This work identifies a critical architectural pitfall in hybrid GNN design and provides the robust architectural solution.

Result: 预测性能良好，训练集误差指标低且R²值高（0.997-1.000），验证集R²值稍低（0.971-0.999）。Random Forest、XGBoost、决策树和k近邻算法表现最佳，而支持向量、线性、Lasso、Ridge和ElasticNet回归表现最差。

Conclusion: 基于代理的SEIRV模型结合机器学习算法能够有效预测WSN中的恶意软件传播，其中集成学习方法表现最优。

Abstract: The lack of epidemiological data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a fundamental difficulty in constructing robust models to forecast and mitigate threats such as viruses and worms. Many studies have examined different epidemic models for WSNs, focusing on how malware infections spread given the network's specific properties, including energy limits and node mobility. In this study, an agent-based implementation of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-vaccinated (SEIRV) mathematical model was employed for machine learning (ML) predictions. Using tools such as NetLogo's BehaviorSpace and Python, two epidemic synthetic datasets were generated and prepared for the application of several ML algorithms. Posed as a regression problem, the infected and recovered nodes were predicted, and the performance of these algorithms is compared using the error metrics of the train and test sets. The predictions performed well, with low error metrics and high R^2 values (0.997, 1.000, 0.999, 1.000), indicating an effective fit to the training set. The validation values were lower (0.992, 0.998, 0.971, and 0.999), as is typical when evaluating model performance on unseen data. Based on the recorded performances, support vector, linear, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet regression were among the worst-performing algorithms, while Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and k-nearest neighbors achieved the best results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器遗忘算法旨在从模型中移除选定训练数据的影响，避免从头重新训练的计算开销。D2D和R2D是易于实现且具有可证明遗忘保证的全批量梯度下降算法，但随机版本在非凸函数上缺乏理论支持。

Method: 通过分析受扰或有偏梯度系统（收缩、半收缩或扩张），建立遗忘与重训练轨迹的最优随机耦合，获得概率敏感性边界，并结合新型松弛高斯机制实现(ε, δ)遗忘保证。

Result: 证明了随机R2D和D2D在强凸、凸和非凸损失函数下均能达到(ε, δ)认证遗忘。D2D在强凸函数上比R2D有更紧的保证，而R2D在凸和非凸设置下也能实现遗忘。

Conclusion: R2D通过逆转累积扰动将遗忘模型拉近重训练模型，在凸和非凸情况下都能实现遗忘；D2D依赖收缩到唯一全局最小值，在强凸函数上提供更优保证。两种算法在不同场景下各有优势。

Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the impact of selected training data from a model without the computational expenses of retraining from scratch. Two such algorithms are ``Descent-to-Delete" (D2D) and ``Rewind-to-Delete" (R2D), full-batch gradient descent algorithms that are easy to implement and satisfy provable unlearning guarantees. In particular, the stochastic version of D2D is widely implemented as the ``finetuning" unlearning baseline, despite lacking theoretical backing on nonconvex functions. In this work, we prove $(ε, δ)$ certified unlearning guarantees for stochastic R2D and D2D for strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex loss functions, by analyzing unlearning through the lens of disturbed or biased gradient systems, which may be contracting, semi-contracting, or expansive respectively. Our argument relies on optimally coupling the random behavior of the unlearning and retraining trajectories, resulting in a probabilistic sensitivity bound that can be combined with a novel relaxed Gaussian mechanism to achieve $(ε, δ)$ unlearning. We determine that D2D can yield tighter guarantees for strongly convex functions compared to R2D by relying on contraction to a unique global minimum. However, unlike D2D, R2D can achieve unlearning in the convex and nonconvex setting because it draws the unlearned model closer to the retrained model by reversing the accumulated disturbances.

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合子治疗组对齐(SGA)和随机时间掩码(RTM)的新框架，用于从时间序列观测中估计反事实结果，在医疗决策等场景中实现更有效的去混杂和时序泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从时间序列观测中估计反事实结果面临两大挑战：反事实轨迹从未被观测到，以及混杂因素随时间演变并在每一步扭曲估计。现有方法在潜在空间中对齐治疗边际分布的做法过于粗糙。

Method: SGA通过迭代治疗无关聚类识别细粒度子治疗组，实现更好的分布匹配；RTM在训练时随机用高斯噪声替换输入协变量，促进模型依赖稳定的历史模式而非当前可能嘈杂的协变量。

Result: 实验表明，单独应用SGA和RTM都能改善反事实结果估计，但它们的协同组合始终达到最先进性能。SGA改善每个时间点的去混杂效果，RTM增强跨时间步的时序泛化和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SGA和RTM的协同组合通过各自独特的互补作用，在反事实结果估计任务中实现了卓越性能，为解决时间序列反事实估计的核心挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Estimating counterfactual outcomes from time-series observations is crucial for effective decision-making, e.g. when to administer a life-saving treatment, yet remains significantly challenging because (i) the counterfactual trajectory is never observed and (ii) confounders evolve with time and distort estimation at every step. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.

Conclusion: 为精细环境管理提供了稳健、低成本、全天候的解决方案，实现了最先进的PM2.5映射性能。

Abstract: High-resolution mapping of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a cornerstone of sustainable urbanism but remains critically hindered by the spatial sparsity of ground monitoring networks. While traditional data-driven methods attempt to bridge this gap using satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), they often suffer from severe, non-random data missingness (e.g., due to cloud cover or nighttime) and inversion biases. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes the Spatiotemporal Physics-Guided Inference Network (SPIN), a novel framework designed for inductive spatiotemporal kriging. Unlike conventional approaches, SPIN synergistically integrates domain knowledge into deep learning by explicitly modeling physical advection and diffusion processes via parallel graph kernels. Crucially, we introduce a paradigm-shifting training strategy: rather than using error-prone AOD as a direct input, we repurpose it as a spatial gradient constraint within the loss function. This allows the model to learn structural pollution patterns from satellite data while remaining robust to data voids. Validated in the highly polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Surrounding Areas (BTHSA), SPIN achieves a new state-of-the-art with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.52 ug/m^3, effectively generating continuous, physically plausible pollution fields even in unmonitored areas. This work provides a robust, low-cost, and all-weather solution for fine-grained environmental management.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of reasoning and generation tasks. However, research studies have shown that LLMs lack the ability to identify causal relationships, a fundamental cornerstone of human intelligence. We first conduct an exploratory investigation of LLMs' behavior when asked to perform a causal-discovery task and find that they mostly rely on the semantic meaning of variable names, ignoring the observation data. This is unsurprising, given that LLMs were never trained to process structural datasets. To first tackle this challenge, we prompt the LLMs with the outputs of established causal discovery algorithms designed for observational datasets. These algorithm outputs effectively serve as the sufficient statistics of the observation data. However, quite surprisingly, we find that prompting the LLMs with these sufficient statistics decreases the LLMs' performance in causal discovery. To address this current limitation, we propose CARE, a framework that enhances LLMs' causal-reasoning ability by teaching them to effectively utilize the outputs of established causal-discovery algorithms through supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results show that a finetuned Qwen2.5-1.5B model produced by CARE significantly outperforms both traditional causal-discovery algorithms and state-of-the-art LLMs with over a thousand times more parameters, demonstrating effective utilization of its own knowledge and the external algorithmic clues.

TL;DR: HGCN2SP是一种用于两阶段随机规划问题的新型模型，通过分层图结构编码场景信息，在强化学习框架下训练，能够高效选择代表性场景并优化求解顺序，显著提升大规模问题的求解效率。


<details>

Conclusion: HGCN2SP通过深度整合场景信息和优化求解顺序，有效解决了传统两阶段随机规划方法在多场景问题中的局限性，为大规模随机规划问题提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Two-stage Stochastic Programming (2SP) is a standard framework for modeling decision-making problems under uncertainty. While numerous methods exist, solving such problems with many scenarios remains challenging. Selecting representative scenarios is a practical method for accelerating solutions. However, current approaches typically rely on clustering or Monte Carlo sampling, failing to integrate scenario information deeply and overlooking the significant impact of the scenario order on solving time. To address these issues, we develop HGCN2SP, a novel model with a hierarchical graph designed for 2SP problems, encoding each scenario and modeling their relationships hierarchically. The model is trained in a reinforcement learning paradigm to utilize the feedback of the solver. The policy network is equipped with a hierarchical graph convolutional network for feature encoding and an attention-based decoder for scenario selection in proper order. Evaluation of two classic 2SP problems demonstrates that HGCN2SP provides high-quality decisions in a short computational time. Furthermore, HGCN2SP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities in handling large-scale instances, even with a substantial number of variables or scenarios that were unseen during the training phase.

TL;DR: Agent0是一个完全自主的框架，通过多步骤协同进化和无缝工具集成，无需外部数据就能进化出高性能的LLM智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM智能体训练依赖人工标注数据，限制了可扩展性，且现有自进化框架受限于模型固有能力和单轮交互，难以开发涉及工具使用或动态推理的复杂课程。

Method: Agent0建立了两个从同一基础LLM初始化的智能体之间的共生竞争：课程智能体提出日益具有挑战性的前沿任务，执行智能体学习解决这些任务。通过外部工具集成增强执行智能体的解题能力，进而推动课程智能体构建更复杂的工具感知任务。

Result: Agent0显著提升了推理能力，将Qwen3-8B-Base模型在数学推理基准上提高了18%，在一般推理基准上提高了24%。

Conclusion: Agent0通过迭代过程建立了一个自我强化的循环，持续产生高质量的课程，实现了完全自主的智能体进化。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents, often trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL), are constrained by a dependency on human-curated data, limiting scalability and tethering AI to human knowledge. Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula. Empirically, Agent0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities, improving the Qwen3-8B-Base model by 18% on mathematical reasoning and 24% on general reasoning benchmarks.

### [45] [Change-of-Basis Pruning via Rotational Invariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16061)
*Alex Ning,Vainateya Rangaraju*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种旋转不变的激活函数设计(TSRA)，使基变换剪枝(CoB)能够在不增加参数的情况下实现，在结构化剪枝中显著提升了剪枝效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化剪枝的有效性取决于重要性在表示空间中的分布，基变换剪枝通过正交线性变换来集中重要性，但标准深度学习架构对此类变换不具不变性。

Method: 引入双子空间径向激活函数(TSRA)，这种激活函数对其两个激活子空间中的正交线性变换具有不变性，使得基变换能够合并到周围权重中而不增加参数。

Result: 在VGG-16上，CoB+TSRA框架在固定比例结构化剪枝中，将可靠剪枝前沿从约30%扩展到70%参数，在阈值剪枝策略中能够剪除90-96%参数而仅产生1-6%的精度下降。

Conclusion: 旋转不变架构为基变换剪枝提供了一条有前景的路径，尽管当前实现相比ReLU基线有4.52%的精度下降，但剪枝效果显著提升。

Abstract: Structured pruning removes entire neurons or channels, but its effectiveness depends on how importance is distributed across the representation space. Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control. However, using activation-magnitude importance, VGG-16 implementing our CoB+TSRA framework shows encouraging results on CIFAR-10. Under fixed-ratio structured pruning, CoB improves accuracy over a TSRA baseline at all pruning ratios and extends reliable pruning frontier from roughly $30\%$ to $70\%$ of parameters without post-prune fine tuning. Under threshold-based pruning strategies, CoB prunes $90-96\%$ of parameters while maintaining $1-6\%$ accuracy drop after fine-tuning. Together, these results indicate that rotationally invariant architectures may offer a promising path towards CoB pruning.

TL;DR: 提出GESC方法，通过投影式干扰机制和相位连接解决GNN在异配图上的自增强和相位不一致问题，在多个图基准测试中优于现有最优模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在异配图上表现不佳，主要由于自增强信号和相位不一致问题，需要新的消息传递机制来有效处理异配图结构。

Method: 使用U(1)相位连接和秩1投影来衰减自平行分量，引入符号和相位感知门控机制调节邻居影响，作为局部陷波滤波器抑制低频模式。

Result: 在多个图基准测试中，GESC方法一致优于近期最先进的模型，提供了统一且干扰感知的消息传递视角。

Conclusion: GESC通过投影式干扰机制有效解决了GNN在异配图上的局限性，为图神经网络提供了新的消息传递范式。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on homophilous graphs but often fail under heterophily due to self-reinforcing and phase-inconsistent signals. We propose a Gauge-Equivariant Graph Network with Self-Interference Cancellation (GESC), which replaces additive aggregation with a projection-based interference mechanism. Unlike prior magnetic or gauge-equivariant GNNs that typically focus on phase handling in spectral filtering while largely relying on scalar weighting, GESC introduces a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ phase connection followed by a rank-1 projection that attenuates self-parallel components before attention. A sign- and phase-aware gate further regulates neighbor influence, attenuating components aligned with current node states and acting as a local notch on low-frequency modes. Across diverse graph benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art models while offering a unified, interference-aware view of message passing.

TL;DR: ILoRA解决了联邦学习中LoRA面临的三个关键挑战：初始化导致的不稳定性、不同秩参数聚合误差以及非IID数据下的客户端漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的LoRA方法在客户端异构性下面临三个关键挑战：随机初始化导致子空间错位、不同秩参数聚合产生偏差、非IID数据加剧客户端漂移，影响模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出ILoRA框架，包含三个核心创新：基于QR的正交初始化确保客户端子空间一致性；拼接QR聚合机制融合不同秩的更新；AdamW优化器配合秩感知控制变量修正本地更新。

Result: 理论收敛保证支持，在视觉和NLP基准测试中，ILoRA相比现有联邦LoRA方法持续实现更优的准确性和收敛稳定性。

Conclusion: ILoRA通过统一的框架有效解决了联邦LoRA中的关键挑战，显著提升了模型性能和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Federated Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) faces three critical challenges under client heterogeneity: (1) Initialization-Induced Instability due to random initialization misaligning client subspaces; (2) Rank Incompatibility and Aggregation Error when averaging LoRA parameters of different ranks, which biases the global model; and (3) exacerbated Client Drift under Non-IID Data, impairing generalization. To address these challenges, we propose ILoRA, a unified framework that integrates three core innovations: a QR-based orthonormal initialization to ensure all clients start in a coherent subspace; a Concatenated QR Aggregation mechanism that fuses heterogeneous-rank updates via concatenation and decomposition, preserving information while maintaining dimension alignment; and an AdamW optimizer with rank-aware control variates to correct local updates and mitigate client drift. Supported by theoretical convergence guarantees, extensive experiments on vision and NLP benchmarks demonstrate that ILoRA consistently achieves superior accuracy and convergence stability compared to existing federated LoRA methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于小型语言模型（<600M参数）的两步简历评估方法，通过监督微调（SFT）建立基线模型，然后使用GRPO强化学习优化，最终在测试集上达到91%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ATS系统过于依赖关键词匹配，容易因语义不匹配而拒绝优秀候选人。需要开发更精细的简历评估模型来克服这一缺陷。

Method: 采用两步微调过程：首先进行监督微调建立基线模型，然后使用GRPO强化学习结合多组件奖励函数进行优化，通过反复调整奖励函数和训练超参数解决奖励黑客问题。

Result: 最终模型在未见测试数据上达到91%准确率，对'SELECTED'类别的召回率为0.85，精确度为1.0，显示出优秀的识别能力和可靠性。

Conclusion: 经过适当执行的两步微调程序可以有效优化小型语言模型，使其能够进行精细且类似人类的候选人评分，克服传统ATS和简单RL使用的缺点。

Abstract: Conventional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) tend to be inflexible keyword-matchers, and deny gifted candidates a role due to a few minor semantic mismatches. This article describes a new two-step process to design a more refined resume evaluation model based on a small language model (<600M parameters) that is finetuned using GRPO on a custom reward function. To begin with, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to build a solid baseline model. Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching. We indicate that the RL application presents a critical problem of reward hacking due to the initial experiments of aggressive penalties, which produces faulty, excessively negative model behaviors. We have overcome this challenge by refining the reward function repeatedly and training hyperparameters into a stable "gentle polishing process" of the reward function. Our resulting GRPO-polished model demonstrates significant real-world efficacy, achieving a final accuracy of 91% on unseen test data. The model shows a strong ability to correctly identify qualified candidates (recall of 0.85 for the 'SELECTED' class) while also showing exceptional precision (1.0), confirming its reliability. These results indicate that a properly executed, two-step fine-tuning procedure can indeed effectively refine a small language model to be able to conduct fine-tuned and human-like candidate scoring, overcoming the drawbacks of both traditional ATS and naive RL usage.

Method: 利用数据归因方法量化训练实验对模型性能的贡献，使用这些归因分数微调基于文本的实验描述嵌入，以捕获实验间的语义相似性和兼容性。

Conclusion: AssayMatch提供了一个数据驱动的机制来策划更高质量的数据集，减少不兼容实验的噪声，提高药物发现模型的预测能力和数据效率。

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models in drug discovery is highly dependent on the quality and consistency of the underlying training data. Due to limitations in dataset sizes, many models are trained by aggregating bioactivity data from diverse sources, including public databases such as ChEMBL. However, this approach often introduces significant noise due to variability in experimental protocols. We introduce AssayMatch, a framework for data selection that builds smaller, more homogenous training sets attuned to the test set of interest. AssayMatch leverages data attribution methods to quantify the contribution of each training assay to model performance. These attribution scores are used to finetune language embeddings of text-based assay descriptions to capture not just semantic similarity, but also the compatibility between assays. Unlike existing data attribution methods, our approach enables data selection for a test set with unknown labels, mirroring real-world drug discovery campaigns where the activities of candidate molecules are not known in advance. At test time, embeddings finetuned with AssayMatch are used to rank all available training data. We demonstrate that models trained on data selected by AssayMatch are able to surpass the performance of the model trained on the complete dataset, highlighting its ability to effectively filter out harmful or noisy experiments. We perform experiments on two common machine learning architectures and see increased prediction capability over a strong language-only baseline for 9/12 model-target pairs. AssayMatch provides a data-driven mechanism to curate higher-quality datasets, reducing noise from incompatible experiments and improving the predictive power and data efficiency of models for drug discovery.

Abstract: Deterministic policy gradient algorithms for continuous control suffer from value estimation biases that degrade performance. While double critics reduce such biases, the exploration potential of double actors remains underexplored. Building on temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR), a double actor-critic framework, this work introduces enhanced methods to achieve flexible bias control and stronger representation learning. We propose three convex combination strategies, symmetric and asymmetric, that balance pessimistic estimates to mitigate overestimation and optimistic exploration via double actors to alleviate underestimation. A single hyperparameter governs this mechanism, enabling tunable control across the bias spectrum. To further improve performance, we integrate augmented state and action representations into the actor and critic networks. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms benchmarks, demonstrating the value of tunable bias and revealing that both overestimation and underestimation can be exploited differently depending on the environment.

Abstract: Trajectory generation has recently drawn growing interest in privacy-preserving urban mobility studies and location-based service applications. Although many studies have used deep learning or generative AI methods to model trajectories and have achieved promising results, the robustness and interpretability of such models are largely unexplored. This limits the application of trajectory generation algorithms on noisy real-world data and their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we exploit the regular structure in urban trajectories and propose a deep generative model based on the pathlet representation, which encode trajectories with binary vectors associated with a learned dictionary of trajectory segments. Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to describe the trajectory generation process, which includes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) component and a linear decoder component. During training, the model can simultaneously learn the latent embedding of pathlet representations and the pathlet dictionary that captures mobility patterns in the trajectory dataset. The conditional version of our model can also be used to generate customized trajectories based on temporal and spatial constraints.
  Our model can effectively learn data distribution even using noisy data, achieving relative improvements of $35.4\%$ and $26.3\%$ over strong baselines on two real-world trajectory datasets. Moreover, the generated trajectories can be conveniently utilized for multiple downstream tasks, including trajectory prediction and data denoising. Lastly, the framework design offers a significant efficiency advantage, saving $64.8\%$ of the time and $56.5\%$ of GPU memory compared to previous approaches.

Motivation: 社交媒体情感识别需要大量训练数据，但由于API成本飙升和平台限制，获取真实数据变得极其昂贵，需要寻找替代方案。

Method: 使用Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)为LLM提供原则性指导，进行合成数据生成，通过可解释性分析指导生成过程。

Result: 在充足种子数据下，SHAP指导的方法能匹配真实数据性能，显著优于朴素生成方法，并大幅改善少数情感类别的分类效果。但语言分析显示合成文本词汇丰富度降低，缺乏真实帖子的个人化和时间复杂性表达。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了负责任合成数据生成的实用框架，同时批判性地指出其局限性，强调可信AI的未来需要在合成效用和真实世界真实性之间权衡取舍。

Abstract: Emotion recognition from social media is critical for understanding public sentiment, but accessing training data has become prohibitively expensive due to escalating API costs and platform restrictions. We introduce an interpretability-guided framework where Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provide principled guidance for LLM-based synthetic data generation. With sufficient seed data, SHAP-guided approach matches real data performance, significantly outperforms naïve generation, and substantially improves classification for underrepresented emotion classes. However, our linguistic analysis reveals that synthetic text exhibits reduced vocabulary richness and fewer personal or temporally complex expressions than authentic posts. This work provides both a practical framework for responsible synthetic data generation and a critical perspective on its limitations, underscoring that the future of trustworthy AI depends on navigating the trade-offs between synthetic utility and real-world authenticity.

Motivation: 当前时间序列异常检测研究主要关注无监督方法，依赖复杂架构建模正常数据分布，但忽视了实际场景中有限异常标签带来的显著性能提升潜力。

Method: 进行监督和无监督范式的首次系统比较，提出STAND——一个简化的监督基线方法。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上的实验表明：(1)标签比模型更重要；(2)监督带来更高回报；(3)STAND在预测一致性和异常定位方面优于无监督方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果主张时间序列异常检测研究应从算法复杂性转向数据中心化，强调标签利用而非纯粹算法复杂度。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical data mining task often constrained by label scarcity. Consequently, current research predominantly focuses on Unsupervised Time-series Anomaly Detection (UTAD), relying on complex architectures to model normal data distributions. However, this approach often overlooks the significant performance gains available from limited anomaly labels achievable in practical scenarios. This paper challenges the premise that architectural complexity is the optimal path for TSAD. We conduct the first methodical comparison between supervised and unsupervised paradigms and introduce STAND, a streamlined supervised baseline. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that: (1) Labels matter more than models: under a limited labeling budget, simple supervised models significantly outperform complex state-of-the-art unsupervised methods; (2) Supervision yields higher returns: the performance gain from minimal supervision far exceeds that from architectural innovations; and (3) Practicality: STAND exhibits superior prediction consistency and anomaly localization compared to unsupervised counterparts. These findings advocate for a data-centric shift in TSAD research, emphasizing label utilization over purely algorithmic complexity.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing need for Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) to improve flexibility in order to match the rapid growth of renewable energies. The Operator Assistance Predictive System (OAPS) developed by Framatome addresses this problem through Model Predictive Control (MPC). In this work, we aim to improve MPC methods through data-driven simulation schemes. Thus, from a set of nonlinear stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), this paper introduces two surrogate models acting as alternative simulation schemes to enhance nuclear reactor core simulation. We show that both data-driven and physics-informed models can rapidly integrate complex dynamics, with a very low computational time (up to 1000x time reduction).

Abstract: Accurate and reliable wind power forecasts are crucial for grid stability, balancing supply and demand, and market risk management. Even though short-term weather forecasts have been thoroughly used to provide short-term renewable power predictions, forecasts involving longer prediction horizons still need investigations. Despite the recent progress in subseasonal-to-seasonal weather probabilistic forecasting, their use for wind power prediction usually involves both temporal and spatial aggregation achieve reasonable skill. In this study, we present a forecasting pipeline enabling to transform ECMWF subseasonal-to-seasonal weather forecasts into wind power forecasts for lead times ranging from 1 day to 46 days at daily resolution. This framework also include post-processing of the resulting power ensembles to account for the biases and lack of dispersion of the weather forecasts. We show that our method is able to outperform a climatological baseline by 50 % in terms of both Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score and Ensemble Mean Squared Error while also providing near perfect calibration of the forecasts for lead times ranging from 15 to 46 days.

Abstract: Rumor detection on social media remains a challenging task due to the complex propagation dynamics and the limited interpretability of existing models. While recent neural architectures capture content and structural features, they often fail to reveal the underlying causal mechanisms of misinformation spread. We propose CausalMamba, a novel framework that integrates Mamba-based sequence modeling, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and differentiable causal discovery via NOTEARS. CausalMamba learns joint representations of temporal tweet sequences and reply structures, while uncovering latent causal graphs to identify influential nodes within each propagation chain. Experiments on the Twitter15 dataset show that our model achieves competitive classification performance compared to strong baselines, and uniquely enables counterfactual intervention analysis. Qualitative results demonstrate that removing top-ranked causal nodes significantly alters graph connectivity, offering interpretable insights into rumor dynamics. Our framework provides a unified approach for rumor classification and influence analysis, paving the way for more explainable and actionable misinformation detection systems.

### [57] [A Switching Framework for Online Interval Scheduling with Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16194)

TL;DR: 提出了SemiTrust-and-Switch框架，将预测算法与经典区间调度算法结合，在不可撤销的在线区间调度中平衡一致性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线区间调度需要在区间到达时立即接受或拒绝，目标是最大化接受区间的总长度且不重叠。学习增强设置中，算法可利用机器学习预测来提升性能，同时保持对预测错误的鲁棒性。

Method: 设计了SemiTrust-and-Switch统一框架，结合预测算法和经典算法，适用于确定性和随机算法。还设计了随机算法，平滑地在预测算法和鲁棒算法间插值。

Result: 框架在特定设置下被证明是紧的（通过下界证明）。随机算法实现了鲁棒性和平滑性——性能随预测质量优雅下降。

Conclusion: SemiTrust-and-Switch框架为学习增强的在线区间调度提供了统一方法，平衡了一致性和鲁棒性，且随机算法实现了平滑的性能退化。

Abstract: We study online interval scheduling in the irrevocable setting, where each interval must be immediately accepted or rejected upon arrival. The objective is to maximize the total length of accepted intervals while ensuring that no two accepted intervals overlap. We consider this problem in a learning-augmented setting, where the algorithm has access to (machine-learned) predictions. The goal is to design algorithms that leverage these predictions to improve performance while maintaining robust guarantees in the presence of prediction errors.
  Our main contribution is the SemiTrust-and-Switch framework, which provides a unified approach for combining prediction-based and classical interval scheduling algorithms. This framework applies to both deterministic and randomized algorithms and captures the trade-off between consistency (performance under accurate predictions) and robustness (performance under adversarial inputs). Moreover, we provide lower bounds, proving the tightness of this framework in particular settings.
  We further design a randomized algorithm that smoothly interpolates between prediction-based and robust algorithms. This algorithm achieves both robustness and smoothness--its performance degrades gracefully with the quality of the prediction.

Abstract: The importance of Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) has increased significantly in domains where data quality is poor or access is limited due to privacy and regulatory constraints. One such domain is recruitment, where publicly available datasets are scarce due to the sensitive nature of information typically found in curricula vitae, such as gender, disability status, or age. %
This lack of accessible, representative data presents a significant obstacle to the development of fair and transparent machine learning models, particularly ranking algorithms that require large volumes of data to effectively learn how to recommend candidates. In the absence of such data, these models are prone to poor generalisation and may fail to perform reliably in real-world scenarios. %
Recent advances in Causal Generative Models (CGMs) offer a promising solution. CGMs enable the generation of synthetic datasets that preserve the underlying causal relationships within the data, providing greater control over fairness and interpretability in the data generation process. %
In this study, we present a specialised SDG method involving two CGMs: one modelling job offers and the other modelling curricula. Each model is structured according to a causal graph informed by domain expertise. We use these models to generate synthetic datasets and evaluate the fairness of candidate rankings under controlled scenarios that introduce specific biases.

Abstract: Deep generative modeling provides a powerful pathway to overcome data scarcity in energy-related applications where experimental data are often limited, costly, or difficult to obtain. By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency. The results showed that both the DM and conditional DM can successfully generate realistic and physics-consistent CHF data. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification was performed to establish confidence in the generated data. The results demonstrated that the conditional DM is highly effective in augmenting CHF data while maintaining acceptable levels of uncertainty.

Motivation: 现实农业分布存在严重类别不平衡，通常呈现长尾分布。作物分类的标注数据集稀缺且获取成本高，训练集常被人工平衡化，导致训练和测试标签分布不匹配，影响真实世界泛化能力。

Method: 将真实世界分布建模为Dirichlet分布的随机变量，在少样本学习期间进行先验增强，模拟目标域的未知标签分布偏斜。

Result: 实验表明DirPA成功转移了决策边界，并通过作为动态特征正则器稳定了训练过程。

Conclusion: DirPA方法有效解决了农业作物分类中的类别不平衡问题，提升了模型在真实世界条件下的泛化性能。

Abstract: Real-world agricultural distributions often suffer from severe class imbalance, typically following a long-tailed distribution. Labeled datasets for crop-type classification are inherently scarce and remain costly to obtain. When working with such limited data, training sets are frequently constructed to be artificially balanced -- in particular in the case of few-shot learning -- failing to reflect real-world conditions. This mismatch induces a shift between training and test label distributions, degrading real-world generalization. To address this, we propose Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA), a novel method that simulates an unknown label distribution skew of the target domain proactively during model training. Specifically, we model the real-world distribution as Dirichlet-distributed random variables, effectively performing a prior augmentation during few-shot learning. Our experiments show that DirPA successfully shifts the decision boundary and stabilizes the training process by acting as a dynamic feature regularizer.

Motivation: 现有非阻塞推理方法依赖参考模态范式，需要一个模态输入完全接收后才能处理，且依赖昂贵的离线分析，无法有效应对跨数据流的不确定通信延迟。

Conclusion: 所提出的神经启发非阻塞推理范式能够实现更精细的精度-延迟权衡控制，在动态网络环境下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Connected cyber-physical systems perform inference based on real-time inputs from multiple data streams. Uncertain communication delays across data streams challenge the temporal flow of the inference process. State-of-the-art (SotA) non-blocking inference methods rely on a reference-modality paradigm, requiring one modality input to be fully received before processing, while depending on costly offline profiling. We propose a novel, neuro-inspired non-blocking inference paradigm that primarily employs adaptive temporal windows of integration (TWIs) to dynamically adjust to stochastic delay patterns across heterogeneous streams while relaxing the reference-modality requirement. Our communication-delay-aware framework achieves robust real-time inference with finer-grained control over the accuracy-latency tradeoff. Experiments on the audio-visual event localization (AVEL) task demonstrate superior adaptability to network dynamics compared to SotA approaches.

Conclusion: 所提出的深度连续过松弛极小极大Q学习算法在高维两人零和博弈中具有更好的性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of a two-player zero-sum game. In the literature, the successive over-relaxation Q-learning algorithm has been developed and implemented, and it is seen to result in a lower contraction factor for the associated Q-Bellman operator resulting in a faster value iteration-based procedure. However, this has been presented only for the tabular case and not for the setting with function approximation that typically caters to real-world high-dimensional state-action spaces. Furthermore, such settings in the case of two-player zero-sum games have not been considered. We thus propose a deep successive over-relaxation minimax Q-learning algorithm that incorporates deep neural networks as function approximators and is suitable for high-dimensional spaces. We prove the finite-time convergence of the proposed algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method over the existing Q-learning algorithm. Our ablation studies demonstrate the effect of different values of the crucial successive over-relaxation parameter.

TL;DR: 分析了pass@k指标作为强化学习优化目标的局限性，发现它是pass@1的正权重版本，在需要探索时学习信号会消失，可能导致探索崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和增强大语言模型的复杂多步推理能力，pass@k指标已被广泛采用作为评估标准和优化目标，但其作为直接优化目标的有效性需要分析。

Method: 分析pass@k目标函数，推导其梯度，证明它是pass@1的逐样本正权重版本，并分析探索崩溃的动态过程。

Result: pass@k目标在需要探索的关键区域提供的学习信号会消失，随着策略概率质量集中，pass@k与pass@1之间的差距会减小。

Conclusion: pass@k作为诊断工具有用，但不适合作为直接优化目标，应使用明确鼓励高效探索的机制来推进推理任务的强化学习。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex, multi-step reasoning is a central focus of modern AI research. To evaluate and enhance this capability, the pass@k metric, which measures the probability of obtaining at least one correct solution in k independent samples, has received significant attention. Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of "exploration collapse", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes. We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization. Instead, mechanisms explicitly encouraging efficient exploration could offer a more effective path forward for reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 轻量级的原型中心方法提供了实用且强大的替代方案，实现了卓越的检索性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Trajectory similarity retrieval is an important part of spatiotemporal data mining, however, existing methods have the following limitations: traditional metrics are computationally expensive, while learning-based methods suffer from substantial training costs and potential instability. This paper addresses these problems by proposing \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{P}rototype \textbf{T}rajectory \textbf{H}ashing (GeoPTH), a novel, lightweight, and non-learning framework for efficient category-based trajectory retrieval. GeoPTH constructs data-dependent hash functions by using representative trajectory prototypes, i.e., small point sets preserving geometric characteristics, as anchors. The hashing process is efficient, which involves mapping a new trajectory to its closest prototype via a robust, \textit{Hausdorff} metric. Extensive experiments show that GeoPTH's retrieval accuracy is highly competitive with both traditional metrics and state-of-the-art learning methods, and it significantly outperforms binary codes generated through simple binarization of the learned embeddings. Critically, GeoPTH consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency. Our work demonstrates that a lightweight, prototype-centric approach offers a practical and powerful alternative, achieving an exceptional retrieval performance and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 图结构数据的机器学习模型预测准确但缺乏解释性，反事实解释能提供预测改变的替代场景，但图域研究相对不足，因为图是离散且非欧几里得对象。

Method: 使用离散扩散模型和分类器自由引导的框架，生成图数据的反事实解释。

Result: 经验证明该方法能可靠生成分布内且结构差异最小的反事实，适用于离散分类目标和连续属性。

Conclusion: Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation框架有效解决了图数据反事实解释生成的挑战。

Abstract: Machine learning models that operate on graph-structured data, such as molecular graphs or social networks, often make accurate predictions but offer little insight into why certain predictions are made. Counterfactual explanations address this challenge by seeking the closest alternative scenario where the model's prediction would change. Although counterfactual explanations are extensively studied in tabular data and computer vision, the graph domain remains comparatively underexplored. Constructing graph counterfactuals is intrinsically difficult because graphs are discrete and non-euclidean objects. We introduce Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation, a novel framework for generating counterfactual explanations on graph data, combining discrete diffusion models and classifier-free guidance. We empirically demonstrate that our method reliably generates in-distribution as well as minimally structurally different counterfactuals for both discrete classification targets and continuous properties.

Conclusion: 现代学习机制可以作为传统观测器设计的强大补充，在不确定系统中实现更准确和鲁棒的状态估计。

Abstract: This work introduces a learning-enhanced observer (LEO) for linear time-invariant systems with uncertain dynamics. Rather than relying solely on nominal models, the proposed framework treats the system matrices as optimizable variables and refines them through gradient-based minimization of a steady-state output discrepancy loss. The resulting data-informed surrogate model enables the construction of an improved observer that effectively compensates for moderate parameter uncertainty while preserving the structure of classical designs. Extensive Monte Carlo studies across diverse system dimensions show systematic and statistically significant reductions, typically exceeding 15\%, in normalized estimation error for both open-loop and Luenberger observers. These results demonstrate that modern learning mechanisms can serve as a powerful complement to traditional observer design, yielding more accurate and robust state estimation in uncertain systems. Codes are available at https://github.com/Hao-B-Shu/LTI_LEO.

Abstract: Healthcare requires AI that is predictive, reliable, and data-efficient. However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare.

Result: XGBoost和CatBoost等传统模型在所有预测时间范围内都优于基础模型。LLM方法存在概率估计不可靠的问题，TabPFN虽然与简单基线方法竞争性相当，但计算成本过高。

Conclusion: 尽管基础模型具有通用性，但在破产预测任务中，当前的基础模型仍不如专门的预测方法有效。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown promise across various financial applications, yet their effectiveness for corporate bankruptcy prediction remains systematically unevaluated against established methods. We study bankruptcy forecasting using Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and TabPFN, evaluated on large, highly imbalanced datasets of over one million company records from the Visegrád Group. We provide the first systematic comparison of foundation models against classical machine learning baselines for this task. Our results show that models such as XGBoost and CatBoost consistently outperform foundation models across all prediction horizons. LLM-based approaches suffer from unreliable probability estimates, undermining their use in risk-sensitive financial settings. TabPFN, while competitive with simpler baselines, requires substantial computational resources with costs not justified by performance gains. These findings suggest that, despite their generality, current foundation models remain less effective than specialized methods for bankruptcy forecasting.

Abstract: Wearable sensor technologies and deep learning are transforming healthcare management. Yet, most health sensing studies focus narrowly on physical chronic diseases. This overlooks the critical need for joint assessment of comorbid physical chronic diseases and depression, which is essential for collaborative chronic care. We conceptualize multi-disease assessment, including both physical diseases and depression, as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, where each disease assessment is modeled as a task. This joint formulation leverages inter-disease relationships to improve accuracy, but it also introduces the challenge of double heterogeneity: chronic diseases differ in their manifestation (disease heterogeneity), and patients with the same disease show varied patterns (patient heterogeneity). To address these issues, we first adopt existing techniques and propose a base method. Given the limitations of the base method, we further propose an Advanced Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning (ADH-MTL) method that improves the base method through three innovations: (1) group-level modeling to support new patient predictions, (2) a decomposition strategy to reduce model complexity, and (3) a Bayesian network that explicitly captures dependencies while balancing similarities and differences across model components. Empirical evaluations on real-world wearable sensor data demonstrate that ADH-MTL significantly outperforms existing baselines, and each of its innovations is shown to be effective. This study contributes to health information systems by offering a computational solution for integrated physical and mental healthcare and provides design principles for advancing collaborative chronic disease management across the pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment phases.

Conclusion: 频域流匹配为多元时间序列预测提供了一种高效、轻量且准确的解决方案，特别适合实时部署场景

Abstract: Multivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting is fundamental to applications ranging from urban mobility and resource management to climate modeling. While recent generative models based on denoising diffusion have advanced state-of-the-art performance in capturing complex data distributions, they suffer from significant computational overhead due to iterative stochastic sampling procedures that limit real-time deployment. Moreover, these models can be brittle when handling high-dimensional, non-stationary, and multi-scale periodic patterns characteristic of real-world sensor networks. We introduce FreqFlow, a novel framework that leverages conditional flow matching in the frequency domain for deterministic MTS forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time domain, FreqFlow transforms the forecasting problem into the spectral domain, where it learns to model amplitude and phase shifts through a single complex-valued linear layer. This frequency-domain formulation enables the model to efficiently capture temporal dynamics via complex multiplication, corresponding to scaling and temporal translations. The resulting architecture is exceptionally lightweight with only 89k parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than competing diffusion-based models-while enabling single-pass deterministic sampling through ordinary differential equation (ODE) integration. Our approach decomposes MTS signals into trend, seasonal, and residual components, with the flow matching mechanism specifically designed for residual learning to enhance long-term forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic speed, volume, and flow datasets demonstrate that FreqFlow achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, on average 7\% RMSE improvements, while being significantly faster and more parameter-efficient than existing methods

Abstract: Clinical time series data from electronic health records and medical registries offer unprecedented opportunities to understand patient trajectories and inform medical decision-making. However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. These results highlight its potential for enabling precise, uncertainty-aware predictions to support clinical decision-making.

### [72] [A Comparison Between Decision Transformers and Traditional Offline Reinforcement Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16475)
*Ali Murtaza Caunhye,Asad Jeewa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了决策变换器与传统离线强化学习算法在ANT连续控制环境中的表现，发现在稀疏奖励场景中DT表现更稳定，而传统方法在密集奖励和高质量数据下更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线RL算法在平衡探索与利用方面存在挑战，特别是在不同奖励密度环境中。决策变换器将离线RL重构为序列建模问题，需要评估其与传统方法在不同奖励结构下的性能差异。

Method: 在ANT连续控制环境中进行实证分析，比较决策变换器与CQL、IQL等传统离线RL算法在密集和稀疏奖励设置下的表现，使用不同质量的数据集进行测试。

Result: DT在稀疏奖励场景中对中等专家数据集表现优异，对奖励密度变化不敏感；IQL在密集奖励和高质量数据下表现更好；CQL在不同数据质量下表现均衡；DT性能方差较低但计算资源需求显著更高。

Conclusion: 序列建模方法更适合奖励结构不确定或数据质量混合的场景，而基于价值的方法在密集奖励和高质量演示数据下仍具竞争力。

Abstract: The field of Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to derive effective policies from pre-collected datasets without active environment interaction. While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了多目标强化学习(MORL)中标量化函数的局限性，发现它们在复杂不确定环境中难以准确逼近帕累托前沿，而内循环多策略算法提供了更稳健的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标量化函数在MORL算法中被广泛使用，但在复杂不确定环境中往往难以准确逼近帕累托前沿，本研究旨在深入探讨标量化方法在多目标决策中的局限性。

Method: 使用外循环多策略方法评估MO Q-Learning算法（采用线性标量化和切比雪夫标量化函数），并探索内循环多策略算法Pareto Q-Learning。

Result: 标量化函数的性能高度依赖环境和帕累托前沿形状，往往无法保留学习过程中发现的解，且偏向在解空间的特定区域寻找解。找到合适的权重配置来采样整个帕累托前沿非常复杂。

Conclusion: 内循环多策略算法可能提供更可持续和可泛化的方法，在动态和不确定环境中促进智能决策。

Abstract: Scalarisation functions are widely employed in MORL algorithms to enable intelligent decision-making. However, these functions often struggle to approximate the Pareto front accurately, rendering them unideal in complex, uncertain environments. This study examines selected Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms across MORL environments with discrete action and observation spaces. We aim to investigate further the limitations associated with scalarisation approaches for decision-making in multi-objective settings. Specifically, we use an outer-loop multi-policy methodology to assess the performance of a seminal single-policy MORL algorithm, MO Q-Learning implemented with linear scalarisation and Chebyshev scalarisation functions. In addition, we explore a pioneering inner-loop multi-policy algorithm, Pareto Q-Learning, which offers a more robust alternative. Our findings reveal that the performance of the scalarisation functions is highly dependent on the environment and the shape of the Pareto front. These functions often fail to retain the solutions uncovered during learning and favour finding solutions in certain regions of the solution space. Moreover, finding the appropriate weight configurations to sample the entire Pareto front is complex, limiting their applicability in uncertain settings. In contrast, inner-loop multi-policy algorithms may provide a more sustainable and generalizable approach and potentially facilitate intelligent decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments.

Abstract: Designing rewards for autonomous cyber attack and defense learning agents in a complex, dynamic environment is a challenging task for subject matter experts. We propose a large language model (LLM)-based reward design approach to generate autonomous cyber defense policies in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven experimental simulation environment. Multiple attack and defense agent personas were crafted, reflecting heterogeneity in agent actions, to generate LLM-guided reward designs where the LLM was first provided with contextual cyber simulation environment information. These reward structures were then utilized within a DRL-driven attack-defense simulation environment to learn an ensemble of cyber defense policies. Our results suggest that LLM-guided reward designs can lead to effective defense strategies against diverse adversarial behaviors.

Conclusion: ODE-ViT提供了一种稳定、可解释且参数效率高的Transformer替代方案，通过ODE框架和教师-学生训练策略，在保持性能的同时显著减少了模型复杂度。

Abstract: In recent years, increasingly large models have achieved outstanding performance across CV tasks. However, these models demand substantial computational resources and storage, and their growing complexity limits our understanding of how they make decisions. Most of these architectures rely on the attention mechanism within Transformer-based designs. Building upon the connection between residual neural networks and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce ODE-ViT, a Vision Transformer reformulated as an ODE system that satisfies the conditions for well-posed and stable dynamics. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ODE-ViT achieves stable, interpretable, and competitive performance with up to one order of magnitude fewer parameters, surpassing prior ODE-based Transformer approaches in classification tasks. We further propose a plug-and-play teacher-student framework in which a discrete ViT guides the continuous trajectory of ODE-ViT by treating the intermediate representations of the teacher as solutions of the ODE. This strategy improves performance by more than 10% compared to training a free ODE-ViT from scratch.

Motivation: 现有的标签错误检测方法需要能够抵抗标签错误的模型，但在有错误标签的数据上训练这样的模型存在挑战。受Focal Loss启发，希望通过调整损失函数来改进这一过程。

Method: 提出了两种新颖而简单的损失函数：一种降低困难样本的权重，另一种完全忽略这些可能包含标签错误的困难样本。

Result: 在人工污染的数据上的实验结果显示，相比传统的分类交叉熵和Focal Loss基线，新方法在检测标签错误方面的F1分数有所提升。

Conclusion: 通过调整损失函数来关注或忽略困难样本，可以有效改进训练数据中标签错误的检测性能。

Abstract: Methods for detecting label errors in training data require models that are robust to label errors (i.e., not fit to erroneously labelled data points). However, acquiring such models often involves training on corrupted data, which presents a challenge. Adjustments to the loss function present an opportunity for improvement. Motivated by Focal Loss (which emphasizes difficult-to-classify samples), two novel, yet simple, loss functions are proposed that de-weight or ignore these difficult samples (i.e., those likely to have label errors). Results on artificially corrupted data show promise, such that F1 scores for detecting errors are improved from the baselines of conventional categorical Cross Entropy and Focal Loss.

Conclusion: 为将基础流匹配模型打造成实用的、可重用的逆问题求解先验指明了路径。

Abstract: Foundation flow-matching (FM) models promise a universal prior for solving inverse problems (IPs), yet today they trail behind domain-specific or even untrained priors. How can we unlock their potential? We introduce FMPlug, a plug-in framework that redefines how foundation FMs are used in IPs. FMPlug combines an instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy with a sharp Gaussianity regularization, adding problem-specific guidance while preserving the Gaussian structures. This leads to a significant performance boost across image restoration and scientific IPs. Our results point to a path for making foundation FM models practical, reusable priors for IP solving.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习研究大多假设客户端稳定参与，忽略了实际中客户端可能动态加入或退出的场景，且缺乏专门针对动态参与联邦学习的基准框架。

Method: 开发了支持可配置数据分布、参与模式和评估指标的DPFL基准框架；提出了KPFL方法，通过维护共享知识池、双年龄和数据偏置加权以及生成式知识蒸馏来应对动态参与挑战。

Result: 基准测试显示动态参与导致FL模型性能显著下降；KPFL能有效提高模型鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 动态参与对联邦学习性能有重大影响，KPFL提供了一种有效的解决方案来应对这一挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a shared model in a distributed manner, setting it apart from traditional deep learning paradigms. However, most existing FL research assumes consistent client participation, overlooking the practical scenario of dynamic participation (DPFL), where clients may intermittently join or leave during training. Moreover, no existing benchmarking framework systematically supports the study of DPFL-specific challenges. In this work, we present the first open-source framework explicitly designed for benchmarking FL models under dynamic client participation. Our framework provides configurable data distributions, participation patterns, and evaluation metrics tailored to DPFL scenarios. Using this platform, we benchmark four major categories of widely adopted FL models and uncover substantial performance degradation under dynamic participation. To address these challenges, we further propose Knowledge-Pool Federated Learning (KPFL), a generic plugin that maintains a shared knowledge pool across both active and idle clients. KPFL leverages dual-age and data-bias weighting, combined with generative knowledge distillation, to mitigate instability and prevent knowledge loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant impact of dynamic participation on FL performance and the effectiveness of KPFL in improving model robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: 这是首个主要利用SVD进行公平性增强而非压缩的工作，为资源受限环境下的模型公平性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As deep learning (DL) techniques become integral to various applications, ensuring model fairness while maintaining high performance has become increasingly critical, particularly in sensitive fields such as medical diagnosis. Although a variety of bias-mitigation methods have been proposed, many rely on computationally expensive debiasing strategies or suffer substantial drops in model accuracy, which limits their practicality in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address this issue, we propose a fairness-oriented low rank factorization (LRF) framework that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve DL model fairness. Unlike traditional SVD, which is mainly used for model compression by decomposing and reducing weight matrices, our work shows that SVD can also serve as an effective tool for fairness enhancement. Specifically, we observed that elements in the unitary matrices obtained from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across groups defined by sensitive attributes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method, named FairLRF, that selectively removes bias-inducing elements from unitary matrices to reduce group disparities, thus enhancing model fairness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms conventional LRF methods as well as state-of-the-art fairness-enhancing techniques. Additionally, an ablation study examines how major hyper-parameters may influence the performance of processed models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work utilizing SVD not primarily for compression but for fairness enhancement.

Motivation: 随机学习网络的普遍逼近性质通常基于概率测度收敛而非更严格的范数收敛，这使得其逼近性能对随机参数选择高度敏感。BRLS作为随机学习模型也存在这一问题。

Method: 在BRLS框架基础上，提出BSCRLS算法，采用新型监督机制自适应约束随机参数范围，并提出了三种增量式BSCRLS算法以满足不同网络更新需求。

Result: 理论证明了BSCRLS基于范数收敛的普遍逼近定理，在太阳能电池板灰尘检测实验中与13种深度和广度学习算法相比表现出有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: BSCRLS算法通过自适应约束随机参数范围，解决了BRLS普遍逼近性质对随机参数选择敏感的问题，实现了基于范数收敛的严格普遍逼近。

Abstract: Universal approximation serves as the foundation of neural network learning algorithms. However, some networks establish their universal approximation property by demonstrating that the iterative errors converge in probability measure rather than the more rigorous norm convergence, which makes the universal approximation property of randomized learning networks highly sensitive to random parameter selection, Broad residual learning system (BRLS), as a member of randomized learning models, also encounters this issue. We theoretically demonstrate the limitation of its universal approximation property, that is, the iterative errors do not satisfy norm convergence if the selection of random parameters is inappropriate and the convergence rate meets certain conditions. To address this issue, we propose the broad stochastic configuration residual learning system (BSCRLS) algorithm, which features a novel supervisory mechanism adaptively constraining the range settings of random parameters on the basis of BRLS framework, Furthermore, we prove the universal approximation theorem of BSCRLS based on the more stringent norm convergence. Three versions of incremental BSCRLS algorithms are presented to satisfy the application requirements of various network updates. Solar panels dust detection experiments are performed on publicly available dataset and compared with 13 deep and broad learning algorithms. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness and superiority of BSCRLS algorithms.

Conclusion: 潜在空间、树驱动扩散为严重类别不平衡下的高保真表格数据增强提供了一种高效且隐私感知的方法。

Abstract: Severe class imbalance is common in real-world tabular learning, where rare but important minority classes are essential for reliable prediction. Existing generative oversampling methods such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models can improve minority-class performance, but they often struggle with tabular heterogeneity, training stability, and privacy concerns. We propose a family of latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods for minority oversampling that use conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees as the vector-field learner. The models operate in compact latent spaces to preserve tabular structure and reduce computation. We introduce three variants: PCAForest, which uses linear PCA embedding; EmbedForest, which uses a learned nonlinear embedding; and AttentionForest, which uses an attention-augmented embedding. Each method couples a GBT-based flow with a decoder back to the original feature space. Across 11 datasets from healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, AttentionForest achieves the best average minority recall while maintaining competitive precision, calibration, and distributional similarity. PCAForest and EmbedForest reach similar utility with much faster generation, offering favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Privacy evaluated with nearest-neighbor distance ratio and distance-to-closest-record is comparable to or better than the ForestDiffusion baseline. Ablation studies show that smaller embeddings tend to improve minority recall, while aggressive learning rates harm stability. Overall, latent-space, tree-driven diffusion provides an efficient and privacy-aware approach to high-fidelity tabular data augmentation under severe class imbalance.

Motivation: 现有的DP-SGD分析通常只建立期望收敛或高概率收敛，但缺乏对单条轨迹几乎必然收敛的理论理解，这限制了对其长期行为的深入认识。

Method: 在标准光滑性假设下，通过满足标准衰减条件的步长，证明了DP-SGD在非凸和强凸设置下的几乎必然收敛，并将分析扩展到动量变体如DP-SHB和DP-NAG。

Result: 证明了DP-SGD及其动量变体在适当步长条件下几乎必然收敛，表明尽管存在隐私引起的扭曲，算法在凸和非凸机制中仍保持路径稳定性。

Conclusion: 这些结果为差分隐私优化提供了更强的理论基础，表明隐私保护算法在路径稳定性方面具有良好的理论保证。

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) has become the standard algorithm for training machine learning models with rigorous privacy guarantees. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of its long-run behavior remains limited: existing analyses typically establish convergence in expectation or with high probability, but do not address the almost sure convergence of single trajectories. In this work, we prove that DP-SGD converges almost surely under standard smoothness assumptions, both in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, provided the step sizes satisfy some standard decaying conditions. Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees. These results provide stronger theoretical foundations for differentially private optimization and suggest that, despite privacy-induced distortions, the algorithm remains pathwise stable in both convex and nonconvex regimes.

Abstract: Palpation, the use of touch in medical examination, is almost exclusively performed by humans. We investigate a proof of concept for an artificial palpation method based on self-supervised learning. Our key idea is that an encoder-decoder framework can learn a $\textit{representation}$ from a sequence of tactile measurements that contains all the relevant information about the palpated object. We conjecture that such a representation can be used for downstream tasks such as tactile imaging and change detection. With enough training data, it should capture intricate patterns in the tactile measurements that go beyond a simple map of forces -- the current state of the art. To validate our approach, we both develop a simulation environment and collect a real-world dataset of soft objects and corresponding ground truth images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We collect palpation sequences using a robot equipped with a tactile sensor, and train a model that predicts sensory readings at different positions on the object. We investigate the representation learned in this process, and demonstrate its use in imaging and change detection.

TL;DR: EGGROLL是一种进化策略算法，通过低秩学习实现大规模神经网络的免反向传播优化，显著降低了计算和内存成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的进化策略(ES)在处理大规模神经网络时，由于需要生成全秩矩阵扰动和批量矩阵乘法，计算和内存成本过高，难以扩展到数十亿参数的现代架构。

Method: 使用低秩矩阵分解生成随机矩阵A和B，形成低秩矩阵扰动AB⊤替代全秩扰动E，将存储复杂度从mn降低到r(m+n)，前向传播成本从O(mn)降低到O(r(m+n))。

Conclusion: EGGROLL成功解决了ES在大规模神经网络中的扩展瓶颈，实现了高效的大规模免反向传播优化。

Abstract: We introduce Evolution Guided General Optimization via Low-rank Learning (EGGROLL), an evolution strategies (ES) algorithm designed to scale backprop-free optimization to large population sizes for modern large neural network architectures with billions of parameters. ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{ï}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times r},\ B\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times r}$ with $r\ll \min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)$ rate. Our experiments show that (1) EGGROLL does not compromise the performance of ES in tabula-rasa RL settings, despite being faster, (2) it is competitive with GRPO as a technique for improving LLM reasoning, and (3) EGGROLL enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities marks a significant milestone, unlocking new frontiers in complex problem-solving. However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了Atlas布朗运动框架来估计未知几何和拓扑结构点云上的热核，并构建了黎曼校正核，形成了黎曼校正Atlas高斯过程(RC-AGPs)，在回归任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据常位于边界未知的限制域或高维点云中，传统高斯过程难以捕捉底层几何结构。现有方法要么假设平坦空间嵌入点云，要么在稀疏或不规则采样点云上表现不佳。

Method: 建立Atlas布朗运动框架估计未知几何点云的热核，结合全局热核和局部RBF核构建黎曼校正核，形成RC-AGPs。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的回归任务表明，该方法在热核估计和回归精度上都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RC-AGPs通过有效弥合复杂高维观测与基于流形推断之间的差距，改进了统计推断。

Abstract: In real-world applications, data often reside in restricted domains with unknown boundaries, or as high-dimensional point clouds lying on a lower-dimensional, nontrivial, unknown manifold. Traditional Gaussian Processes (GPs) struggle to capture the underlying geometry in such settings. Some existing methods assume a flat space embedded in a point cloud, which can be represented by a single latent chart (latent space), while others exhibit weak performance when the point cloud is sparse or irregularly sampled. The goal of this work is to address these challenges. The main contributions are twofold: (1) We establish the Atlas Brownian Motion (BM) framework for estimating the heat kernel on point clouds with unknown geometries and nontrivial topological structures; (2) Instead of directly using the heat kernel estimates, we construct a Riemannian corrected kernel by combining the global heat kernel with local RBF kernel and leading to the formulation of Riemannian-corrected Atlas Gaussian Processes (RC-AGPs). The resulting RC-AGPs are applied to regression tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets. These examples demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both heat kernel estimation and regression accuracy. It improves statistical inference by effectively bridging the gap between complex, high-dimensional observations and manifold-based inferences.

*Feiyue Zhao,Yangfan He,Zhichao Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种角度图分数傅里叶变换（AGFRFT），统一了分数阶和角度谱分析，解决了现有GFRFT缺乏角度调节和AGFT在零角度退化失败的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图分数傅里叶变换（GFRFT）缺乏角度调节能力，而角度图傅里叶变换（AGFT）在零角度无法退化到标准GFT，存在理论一致性和可解释性的关键缺陷。

Method: 提出了角度GFRFT（AGFRFT）统一框架，通过退化友好的旋转矩阵族确保在零角度精确退化到GFT，定义了两个AGFRFT变体（I-AGFRFT和II-AGFRFT），支持角度和分数阶的可学习联合参数化。

Result: 在真实世界数据去噪、图像去噪和点云去噪的广泛实验中，AGFRFT在谱集中度、重建质量和可控谱操作方面优于GFRFT和AGFT。

Conclusion: AGFRFT为图信号处理中的集成角度分数谱分析提供了一个鲁棒且灵活的工具，具有单位性、可逆性和平滑参数依赖性。

Abstract: Graph spectral representations are fundamental in graph signal processing, offering a rigorous framework for analyzing and processing graph-structured data. The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) extends the classical graph Fourier transform (GFT) with a fractional-order parameter, enabling flexible spectral analysis while preserving mathematical consistency. The angular graph Fourier transform (AGFT) introduces angular control via GFT eigenvector rotation; however, existing constructions fail to degenerate to the GFT at zero angle, which is a critical flaw that undermines theoretical consistency and interpretability. To resolve these complementary limitations - GFRFT's lack of angular regulation and AGFT's defective degeneracy - this study proposes an angular GFRFT (AGFRFT), a unified framework that integrates fractional-order and angular spectral analyses with theoretical rigor. A degeneracy-friendly rotation matrix family ensures exact GFT degeneration at zero angle, with two AGFRFT variants (I-AGFRFT and II-AGFRFT) defined accordingly. Rigorous theoretical analyses confirm their unitarity, invertibility, and smooth parameter dependence. Both support learnable joint parameterization of the angle and fractional order, enabling adaptive spectral processing for diverse graph signals. Extensive experiments on real-world data denoising, image denoising, and point cloud denoising demonstrate that AGFRFT outperforms GFRFT and AGFT in terms of spectral concentration, reconstruction quality, and controllable spectral manipulation, establishing a robust and flexible tool for integrated angular fractional spectral analysis in graph signal processing.

### [89] [Spectral Identifiability for Interpretable Probe Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16288)
*William Hao-Cheng Huang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文揭示了线性探针可靠性的光谱机制，提出了谱可识别性原理(SIP)，通过特征间隙大小来预测探针稳定性。当任务相关方向的特征间隙大于Fisher估计误差时，探针稳定；反之则出现相变式不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性探针被广泛用于解释和评估神经表示，但其可靠性尚不明确，因为探针在某些情况下表现准确，在其他情况下会不可预测地崩溃。需要理解这种现象背后的机制。

Method: 提出了谱可识别性原理(SIP)，这是一个可验证的Fisher启发的探针稳定性条件。通过分析特征间隙几何、样本大小和误分类风险之间的连接，提供可解释的诊断方法。

Result: 当任务相关方向的特征间隙大于Fisher估计误差时，估计子空间会集中且准确性保持一致；当特征间隙闭合时，会以相变方式诱发不稳定性。控制合成研究证实了这些预测。

Conclusion: 光谱检查可以在不可靠探针扭曲下游评估之前预测其不可靠性，为探针可靠性提供了理论框架和实用诊断工具。

Abstract: Linear probes are widely used to interpret and evaluate neural representations, yet their reliability remains unclear, as probes may appear accurate in some regimes but collapse unpredictably in others. We uncover a spectral mechanism behind this phenomenon and formalize it as the Spectral Identifiability Principle (SIP), a verifiable Fisher-inspired condition for probe stability. When the eigengap separating task-relevant directions is larger than the Fisher estimation error, the estimated subspace concentrates and accuracy remains consistent, whereas closing this gap induces instability in a phase-transition manner. Our analysis connects eigengap geometry, sample size, and misclassification risk through finite-sample reasoning, providing an interpretable diagnostic rather than a loose generalization bound. Controlled synthetic studies, where Fisher quantities are computed exactly, confirm these predictions and show how spectral inspection can anticipate unreliable probes before they distort downstream evaluation.

Motivation: 澄清生成器匹配框架中损失函数和参数化对时间和状态的依赖性，为实践中常用的时间依赖损失加权方案提供理论支持。

Method: 通过数学分析证明在生成器匹配框架下，Bregman散度损失和线性参数化可以依赖于X_t和t，且时间期望可以基于广泛的时间分布。

Result: 证明了时间依赖损失加权方案在生成器匹配（包括流匹配和扩散模型）中的理论合理性，并简化了X_1预测器方案的构建。

Conclusion: 生成器匹配框架允许损失和参数化对时间和状态的依赖性，这为实际训练中的时间依赖加权方案提供了理论依据，并有助于简化模型构建。

Abstract: This brief note clarifies that, in Generator Matching (which subsumes a large family of flow matching and diffusion models over continuous, manifold, and discrete spaces), both the Bregman divergence loss and the linear parameterization of the generator can depend on both the current state $X_t$ and the time $t$, and we show that the expectation over time in the loss can be taken with respect to a broad class of time distributions. We also show this for Edit Flows, which falls outside of Generator Matching. That the loss can depend on $t$ clarifies that time-dependent loss weighting schemes, often used in practice to stabilize training, are theoretically justified when the specific flow or diffusion scheme is a special case of Generator Matching (or Edit Flows). It also often simplifies the construction of $X_1$-predictor schemes, which are sometimes preferred for model-related reasons. We show examples that rely upon the dependence of linear parameterizations, and of the Bregman divergence loss, on $t$ and $X_t$.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一个多项式时间算法，在对称k-随机块模型中达到极小极大最优误分类率，匹配Kesten-Stigum阈值，且对节点损坏具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决社区检测中计算效率与极小极大最优性之间的差距，特别是在接近KS阈值时，现有方法要么计算效率低，要么需要更强的假设条件。

Method: 通过Sum-of-Squares框架鲁棒化多数投票，并开发基于鲁棒多数投票的图二分算法来改进初始估计的误分类率。

Result: 算法在C≥Kk²logk条件下达到误分类率exp(-(1±o(1))C/k)，即使在η≤exp(-(1±o(1))C/k)比例的节点被损坏时也成立。

Conclusion: 这是第一个在接近KS阈值的多项式时间算法，在标准和节点鲁棒设置下都达到极小极大率，填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: We study community detection in the \emph{symmetric $k$-stochastic block model}, where $n$ nodes are evenly partitioned into $k$ clusters with intra- and inter-cluster connection probabilities $p$ and $q$, respectively.
  Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax-optimal misclassification rate
  \begin{equation*}
  \exp \Bigl(-\bigl(1 \pm o(1)\bigr) \tfrac{C}{k}\Bigr),
  \quad \text{where } C = (\sqrt{pn} - \sqrt{qn})^2,
  \end{equation*}
  whenever $C \ge K\,k^2\,\log k$ for some universal constant $K$, matching the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold up to a $\log k$ factor.
  Notably, this rate holds even when an adversary corrupts an $η\le \exp\bigl(- (1 \pm o(1)) \tfrac{C}{k}\bigr)$ fraction of the nodes.
  To the best of our knowledge, the minimax rate was previously only attainable either via computationally inefficient procedures [ZZ15] or via polynomial-time algorithms that require strictly stronger assumptions such as $C \ge K k^3$ [GMZZ17].
  In the node-robust setting, the best known algorithm requires the substantially stronger condition $C \ge K k^{102}$ [LM22].
  Our results close this gap by providing the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax rate near the KS threshold in both settings.
  Our work has two key technical contributions:
  (1) we robustify majority voting via the Sum-of-Squares framework,
  (2) we develop a novel graph bisection algorithm via robust majority voting, which allows us to significantly improve the misclassification rate to $1/\mathrm{poly}(k)$ for the initial estimation near the KS threshold.
