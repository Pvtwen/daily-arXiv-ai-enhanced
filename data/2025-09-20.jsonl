Here we introduce the Tensor Atomic Cluster Expansion and\nTensor Moment Potential, the first unified framework formulated entirely in\nCartesian space for the systematic prediction of arbitrary structure-determined\ntensorial properties. TACE achieves this by decomposing atomic environments\ninto a complete hierarchy of (irreducible) Cartesian tensors, ensuring\nsymmetry-consistent representations that naturally encode invariance and\nequivariance constraints. Beyond geometry, TACE incorporates universal\nembeddings that flexibly integrate diverse attributes including basis sets,\ncharges, magnetic moments and field perturbations. This allows explicit control\nover external invariants and equivariants in the prediction process. Long-range\ninteractions are also accurately described through the Latent Ewald Summation\nmodule within the short-range approximation, providing a rigorous yet\ncomputationally efficient treatment of electrostatic interactions. We\ndemonstrate that TACE attains accuracy, stability, and efficiency on par with\nor surpassing leading equivariant frameworks across finite molecules and\nextended materials, including in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, spectra,\nhessians, external-field response, charged systems, magnetic systems,\nmulti-fidelity training, and heterogeneous catalytic systems. Crucially, TACE\nbridges scalar and tensorial modeling and establishes a Cartesian-space\nparadigm that unifies and extends beyond the design space of\nspherical-harmonic-based methods. This work lays the foundation for a new\ngeneration of universal atomistic machine learning models capable of\nsystematically capturing the rich interplay of geometry, fields and material\nproperties within a single coherent framework."}

An existing method for\nvertex-wise flexible sampling is able to control the number of active vertices\nbut cannot incorporate prior knowledge of mandatory or forbidden vertices. To\naddress these challenges, we formulate the operator design as a problem that\nhandles a constraint of the number of active vertices and prior knowledge on\nspecific vertices for sampling, mandatory inclusion or exclusion. We\ntransformed this constrained problem into a difference-of-convex (DC)\noptimization problem by using the nuclear norm and a DC penalty for vertex\nselection. To solve this, we develop a convergent solver based on the general\ndouble-proximal gradient DC algorithm.

Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning\nstage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage\npost-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning\n(SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral\ncloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage,\nSelf-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a\nwell-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of\nrobots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human\nsupervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot\nembodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on\nEmbodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT\nand Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling\nimitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to\npolicies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight\nthat the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key\nto this sample-efficiency. Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination\nuniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously\npracticing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors\nobserved in the imitation learning datasets used during training. These\nfindings highlight the transformative potential of combining pretrained\nfoundation models with online Self-Improvement to enable autonomous skill\nacquisition in robotics.

Several\nrecent studies indicate that adapting precision levels across different\nparameters can maintain accuracy comparable to full-precision models while\nsignificantly reducing computational demands. However, existing embedded\nmicroprocessors lack sufficient architectural support for efficiently executing\nmixed-precision NNs, both in terms of ISA extensions and hardware design,\nresulting in inefficiencies such as excessive data packing/unpacking and\nunderutilized arithmetic units.

We introduce MaRVIn, a cross-layer hardware-software\nco-design framework that enhances power efficiency and performance through a\ncombination of hardware improvements, mixed-precision quantization, ISA-level\noptimizations, and cycle-accurate emulation.

While most prior work assumes a known causal\nmodel, recent efforts relax this assumption by enforcing additional\nconstraints.

This raises a\nfundamental question: Can we harness the benefits of causal reasoning to design\nefficient and effective fairness solutions without relying on strong\nassumptions about the underlying causal model? In this paper, we seek to answer\nthis question by introducing CausalPre, a scalable and effective\ncausality-guided data pre-processing framework that guarantees justifiable\nfairness, a strong causal notion of fairness. CausalPre extracts causally fair\nrelationships by reformulating the originally complex and computationally\ninfeasible extraction task into a tailored distribution estimation problem. To\nensure scalability, CausalPre adopts a carefully crafted variant of\nlow-dimensional marginal factorization to approximate the joint distribution,\ncomplemented by a heuristic algorithm that efficiently tackles the associated\ncomputational challenge.
