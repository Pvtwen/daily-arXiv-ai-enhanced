While data-driven findings in AI\noffer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many\nare difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is\nthe uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science\nlife cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for\nthis uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework\nfor veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to\naddressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated\nand streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with\nguided use of generative AI.

In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware\nSystem (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this\nlimitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single\nmonolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent\npossesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a\ndedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,\nallowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to\naggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level\nMeta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.\nBy adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC\neffectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher\nreturns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall\nstability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and\nadaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework\nachieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral\ndiversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering.

To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise\narchitecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages\nKAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven\nbenchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we\nsystematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison\nwith traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive\nflexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the\ninfluence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore,\nwe identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer\npractical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF. Together, these\ninsights constitute the first empirically grounded guidelines for effectively\nleveraging KAN in LTSF. Code is available in the supplementary file."}

In each global round, the\naccess point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster\nindependently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared\ndataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and\ndiscarding malicious updates.

Existing\nevaluation metrics commonly measure distributional distances between training\nand generated sets, while the medical field requires assessing quality at the\nindividual level for each generated shape, which demands labor-intensive expert\nreview.\n  In this paper, we investigate the use of classical machine learning (ML)\nmethods and PointNet as an alternative, interpretable approach for assessing\nthe quality of generated liver shapes. We sample point clouds from the surfaces\nof the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and\ntrain a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as\ngood or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to\nassess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.\n  Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only\ninterpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert\nevaluation.

We also\nconsider an example that illustrates the difficulty of generalizing the binary\nsolution to a multi-class setting and deduce relevant properties of the\nconfusion matrix."}

However, how to\naccurately quantify the uncertainty of predictions from large-scale deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) remains an unresolved issue. To address this issue, we\nintroduce a novel post-processing approach. This approach feeds the output from\nthe last hidden layer of a pre-trained large-scale DNN model into a stochastic\nneural network (StoNet), then trains the StoNet with a sparse penalty on a\nvalidation dataset and constructs prediction intervals for future observations.\nWe establish a theoretical guarantee for the validity of this approach; in\nparticular, the parameter estimation consistency for the sparse StoNet is\nessential for the success of this approach. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach can construct honest confidence\nintervals with shorter interval lengths compared to conformal methods and\nachieves better calibration compared to other post-hoc calibration techniques.\nAdditionally, we show that the StoNet formulation provides us with a platform\nto adapt sparse learning theory and methods from linear models to DNNs."}

But identifying causality, and particularly counterfactual\nreasoning, remains an elusive task. In this paper, we make progress on this\ntask by utilizing instrumental variables (IVs). IVs are a classic tool for\nmitigating bias from unobserved confounders when estimating causal effects.\nWhile IV methods have been extended to non-separable structural models at the\npopulation level, existing approaches to counterfactual prediction typically\nassume additive noise in the outcome. In this paper, we show that under\nstandard IV assumptions, along with the assumptions that latent noises in\ntreatment and outcome are strictly monotonic and jointly Gaussian, the\ntreatment-outcome relationship becomes uniquely identifiable from observed\ndata. This enables counterfactual inference even in nonseparable models. We\nimplement our approach by training a normalizing flow to maximize the\nlikelihood of the observed data, demonstrating accurate recovery of the\nunderlying outcome function.

However, because standard training\nobjectives prioritize overall predictive accuracy, these predictions inherently\nsuffer from shrinkage toward the mean, leading to attenuated estimates of\ncausal treatment effects and limiting their utility in policy. Existing\ndebiasing methods, such as Prediction-Powered Inference, can handle this\nattenuation bias but require additional fresh ground-truth data at the\ndownstream stage of causal inference, which restricts their applicability in\ndata-scarce environments. Here, we introduce and evaluate two correction\nmethods -- linear calibration correction and Tweedie's correction -- that\nsubstantially reduce prediction bias without relying on newly collected labeled\ndata. Linear calibration corrects bias through a straightforward linear\ntransformation derived from held-out calibration data, whereas Tweedie's\ncorrection leverages empirical Bayes principles to directly address\nshrinkage-induced biases by exploiting score functions derived from the model's\nlearning patterns. Through analytical exercises and experiments using\nDemographic and Health Survey data, we demonstrate that the proposed methods\nmeet or outperform existing approaches that either require (a) adjustments to\ntraining pipelines or (b) additional labeled data. These approaches may\nrepresent a promising avenue for improving the reliability of causal inference\nwhen direct outcome measures are limited or unavailable, enabling a \"one map,\nmany trials\" paradigm where a single upstream data creation team produces\npredictions usable by many downstream teams across diverse ML pipelines."}

However, for modern applications, e.g.,\nthe optimization of nuclear physics detectors, each experiment run can require\nhundreds of CPU hours, making the optimization of its black-box simulator over\na high-dimensional space a challenging task. Given limited runs at inputs\n$\\mathbf{x}_1, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_n$, the best solution from these evaluated\ninputs can be far from optimal, particularly as dimensionality increases.\nExisting black-box methods, however, largely employ this ''pick-the-winner''\n(PW) solution, which leads to mediocre optimization performance. To address\nthis, we propose a new Black-box Optimization via Marginal Means (BOMM)\napproach. The key idea is a new estimator of a global optimizer $\\mathbf{x}^*$\nthat leverages the so-called marginal mean functions, which can be efficiently\ninferred with limited runs in high dimensions. Unlike PW, this estimator can\nselect solutions beyond evaluated inputs for improved optimization performance.\nAssuming the objective function follows a generalized additive model with\nunknown link function and under mild conditions, we prove that the BOMM\nestimator not only is consistent for optimization, but also has an optimization\nrate that tempers the ''curse-of-dimensionality'' faced by existing methods,\nthus enabling better performance as dimensionality increases. We present a\npractical framework for implementing BOMM using the transformed additive\nGaussian process surrogate model. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\nBOMM in numerical experiments and an application on neutrino detector\noptimization in nuclear physics."}
