Abstract: Digital twins (DTs), virtual simulated replicas of physical scenes, are
transforming various industries. However, their potential in radio frequency
(RF) sensing applications has been limited by the unidirectional nature of
conventional RF simulators. In this paper, we present InverTwin, an
optimization-driven framework that creates RF digital twins by enabling
bidirectional interaction between virtual and physical realms. InverTwin
overcomes the fundamental differentiability challenges of RF optimization
problems through novel design components, including path-space differentiation
to address discontinuity in complex simulation functions, and a radar surrogate
model to mitigate local non-convexity caused by RF signal periodicity. These
techniques enable smooth gradient propagation and robust optimization of the DT
model. Our implementation and experiments demonstrate InverTwin's versatility
and effectiveness in augmenting both data-driven and model-driven RF sensing
systems for DT reconstruction.

Abstract: Regularization for denoising in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically
achieved using convex regularization functions. Recently, deep learning
techniques have been shown to provide superior denoising performance. However,
this comes at the price of lack of explainability, interpretability and
stability, which are all crucial to MRI. In this work, we present a
constructive approach for designing weakly-convex regularization functions for
MR image denoising. We show that our technique performs on par with
state-of-the-art denoisers for diffusion-weighted MR image denoising. Our
technique can be applied to design weakly-convex convolutional neural networks
with prototype activation functions that impart interpretability and are
provably convergent. We also show that our technique exhibits fewer denoising
artifacts by demonstrating its effect on brain microstructure modelling.

*Jingjing Zhao,Haowen Song,Xidong Mu,Kaiquan Cai,Yanbo Zhu,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种基于捏合天线系统(PASS)的多用户通信传输结构(WM/WD/WS)，研究了多组多播通信中的联合基带信号处理和波束成形设计，并提出了相应的优化算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定位置天线系统在无线通信中存在局限性，需要创新的柔性天线技术来确保可靠的视距连接和动态天线阵列重构，以提升多用户通信性能。

Method: 提出了波导复用(WM)、波导分割(WD)和波导切换(WS)三种传输结构；针对最大最小公平性问题，提出了基于惩罚对偶分解(PDD)的算法；为WS结构的单播情况设计了低复杂度算法。

Conclusion: PASS技术通过动态天线重构能力，为多用户无线通信系统提供了显著的性能提升，不同的传输结构适用于不同的通信场景，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) represent an innovative advancement in
flexible-antenna technologies, aimed at significantly improving wireless
communications by ensuring reliable line-of-sight connections and dynamic
antenna array reconfigurations. To employ multi-waveguide PASS in multi-user
communications, three practical transmission structures are proposed, namely
waveguide multiplexing (WM), waveguide division (WD), and waveguide switching
(WS). Based on the proposed structures, the joint baseband signal processing
and pinching beamforming design is studied for a general multi-group multicast
communication system, with the unicast communication encompassed as a special
case. A max-min fairness problem is formulated for each proposed transmission
structure, subject to the maximum transmit power constraint. For WM, to solve
the highly-coupled and non-convex MMF problem with complex exponential and
fractional expressions, a penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is
invoked for obtaining locally optimal solutions. Specifically, the augmented
Lagrangian relaxation is first applied to alleviate the stringent coupling
constraints, which is followed by the block decomposition over the resulting
augmented Lagrangian function. Then, the proposed PDD-based algorithm is
extended to solve the MMF problem for both WD and WS. Furthermore, a
low-complexity algorithm is proposed for the unicast case employing the WS
structure, by simultaneously aligning the signal phases and minimizing the
large-scale path loss at each user. Finally, numerical results reveal that: 1)
the MMF performance is significantly improved by employing the PASS compared to
conventional fixed-position antenna systems; 2) WS and WM are suitable for
unicast and multicast communications, respectively; 3) the performance gap
between WD and WM can be significantly alleviated when the users are
geographically isolated.

Abstract: This paper presents a Gm-C dynamic amplifier with high linearity and high
temperature and power supply voltage stability. The main part of the amplifier
employs two asymmetric differential pairs to enhance transconductance
linearity. The amplifier maintains a nearly constant gain within a differential
input range of -40 mV to 40 mV, and achieves a total harmonic distortion (THD)

which improves the temperature and supply voltage stability of the amplifier's
transconductance and gain. When the differential input is 1 mV, the power
supply voltage fluctuates by $\pm$10%, and the temperature varies between
-40$\mathrm{^\circ C}$ and 120$\mathrm{^\circ C}$, the standard deviation of
the gain distribution is 262m, and the distribution range is from 15.1 to 16.3.

Abstract: High-precision localization turns into a crucial added value and asset for
next-generation wireless systems. Carrier phase positioning (CPP) enables
sub-meter to centimeter-level accuracy and is gaining interest in 5G-Advanced
standardization. While CPP typically complements time-of-arrival (ToA)
measurements, recent literature has introduced a phase-only positioning
approach in a distributed antenna/MIMO system context with minimal bandwidth
requirements, using deep learning (DL) when operating under ideal hardware
assumptions. In more practical scenarios, however, antenna failures can largely
degrade the performance. In this paper, we address the challenging phase-only
positioning task, and propose a new DL-based localization approach harnessing
the so-called hyperbola intersection principle, clearly outperforming the
previous methods. Additionally, we consider and propose a processing and
learning mechanism that is robust to antenna element failures. Our results show
that the proposed DL model achieves robust and accurate positioning despite
antenna impairments, demonstrating the viability of data-driven,
impairment-tolerant phase-only positioning mechanisms. Comprehensive set of
numerical results demonstrates large improvements in localization accuracy
against the prior art methods.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is a promising technology for
future wireless networks, enabling simultaneous communication and sensing using
shared resources. This paper investigates the performance of full-duplex (FD)
communication in near-field ISAC systems, where spherical-wave propagation
introduces unique beam-focusing capabilities. We propose a joint optimization
framework for transmit and receive beamforming at the base station to minimize
transmit power while satisfying rate constraints for multi-user downlink
transmission, multi-user uplink reception, and multi-target sensing. Our
approach employs alternating optimization combined with semidefinite relaxation
and Rayleigh quotient techniques to address the non-convexity of the problem.
Simulation results demonstrate that FD-enabled near-field ISAC achieves
superior power efficiency compared to half-duplex and far-field benchmarks,
effectively detecting targets at identical angles while meeting communication
requirements.

### [8] [Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Routing for Heterogeneous Multi-Hop Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14884)

Abstract: Routing in multi-hop wireless networks is a complex problem, especially in
heterogeneous networks where multiple wireless communication technologies
coexist. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as Q-learning, have been
introduced for decentralized routing by allowing nodes to make decisions based
on local observations. However, Q-learning suffers from scalability issues and
poor generalization due to the difficulty in managing the Q-table in large or
dynamic network topologies, especially in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with
diverse channel characteristics. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel deep
Q-network (DQN)-based routing framework for heterogeneous multi-hop wireless
networks to maximize the end-to-end rate of the route by improving scalability
and adaptability, where each node uses a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate
the Q-values and jointly select the next-hop relay and a communication
technology for transmission. To achieve better performance with the DNN,
selecting which nodes to exchange information is critical, as it not only
defines the state and action spaces but also determines the input to the DNN.
To this end, we propose neighbor node selection strategies based on channel
gain and rate between nodes rather than a simple distance-based approach for an
improved set of states and actions for DQN-based routing. During training, the
model experiences diverse network topologies to ensure generalization and
robustness, and simulation results show that the proposed neighbor node
selection outperforms simple distance-based selection. Further, we observe that
the DQN-based approach outperforms various benchmark schemes and performs
comparably to the optimal approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了将表格学生数据转换为图结构是否能提高辍学预测准确性，发现特定GNN配置（GraphSAGE+PCA-KMeans）比传统表格模型表现更好，但图构建策略对结果影响显著


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生辍学是全球教育系统面临的重大挑战，传统机器学习模型在表格数据上已有不错表现，但图神经网络(GNNs)可能通过捕捉学生数据中复杂的关联关系来提供优势

Method: 将表格学生数据转换为图结构（主要使用聚类技术），比较GNNs（自定义GCN和GraphSAGE）与表格模型（随机森林、XGBoost、TabNet）的性能，探索不同的图构建策略（K-Means、HDBSCAN聚类和PCA、UMAP降维）

Result: 特定GNN配置（GraphSAGE+PCA-KMeans聚类）表现最佳，比最强表格基线（XGBoost）在宏观F1分数上提高约7个百分点，准确率提高近2个百分点，但其他GNN配置和图构建方法未能持续超越表格模型

Conclusion: GNNs在辍学预测中具有潜力，但图生成策略和GNN架构选择至关重要，突显了将表格数据最优转换为图结构进行基于图的学习的挑战

Abstract: Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide,
leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk
of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning
(ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent
in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether
transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using
clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the
performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE)
on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest
(RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments
explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering
algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques
(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,
GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior
performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage
points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular
baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction
methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical
role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This
highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally
transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.

Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset,
often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity
in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various
interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline,
moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform
well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an
approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be
utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS),
if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform
statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep
learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models,
we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for
dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance
among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.

Abstract: This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism
that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our
method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to
identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search
process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used
to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph
Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees
and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the
decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the
problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph
structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding
local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then
applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates
both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements
across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants,
including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time
Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000
customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the
observed improvements.

Conclusion: 该研究为信任域优化方法在变化形态结构下的理论行为提供了重要见解，有助于开发更可扩展和重用的控制策略。

Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational
reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical
performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and
reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological
generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different
kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and
effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these
architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region
methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To
this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy
optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality
influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints
imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the
theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is
carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a
systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without
altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study
morphological generalization.

considerable discrepancies across datasets,including differences in acquisition
protocols and subject demographics,significantly hinder the robustness and
generalizability of models in cross-dataset detection scenarios.To address such
challenges,this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework named
MCLPD,which integrates multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight
supervised fine-tuning to enhance cross-dataset PD detection performance.During
pre-training,MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on the unlabeled UNM
dataset.To build contrastive pairs,it applies dual augmentations in both time
and frequency domains,which enrich the data and naturally fuse time-frequency
information.In the fine-tuning phase,only a small proportion of labeled data
from another two datasets (UI and UC)is used for supervised
optimization.Experimental results show that MCLPD achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on
UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1%of labeled data,which further improve to 0.97
and 0.87,respectively,when 5%of labeled data is used.Compared to existing
methods,MCLPD substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while
reducing the dependency on labeled data,demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Abstract: This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on
the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to
assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the
reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific
traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research
uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in
varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution
analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to
their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics
and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this
comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability
in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be
guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel
trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future
inland waterways navigation.

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been established as an effective method for
detecting Parkinson's disease, typically diagnosed early.Current Parkinson's
disease detection methods have shown significant success within individual
datasets, however, the variability in detection methods across different EEG
datasets and the small size of each dataset pose challenges for training a
generalizable model for cross-dataset scenarios. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a GAN-enhanced generalizable model, named GEPD, specifically for
EEG-based cross-dataset classification of Parkinson's disease.First, we design
a generative network that creates fusion EEG data by controlling the
distribution similarity between generated data and real data.In addition, an
EEG signal quality assessment model is designed to ensure the quality of
generated data great.Second, we design a classification network that utilizes a
combination of multiple convolutional neural networks to effectively capture
the time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals, while maintaining a
generalizable structure and ensuring easy convergence.This work is dedicated to
utilizing intelligent methods to study pathological manifestations, aiming to
facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological diseases.The evaluation
results demonstrate that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art
models in cross-dataset settings, achieving an accuracy of 84.3% and an
F1-score of 84.0%, showcasing the generalizability of the proposed model.

TL;DR: MOBAL是一种在线贝叶斯学习方法，用于网络攻击事件响应规划，能够在模型不准确的情况下通过迭代学习优化响应策略。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的网络安全事件响应决策支持框架需要详细的系统模型，但在实际攻击中信息往往不完整或不准确，限制了其实用性。

Method: 提出MOBAL方法：通过贝叶斯学习迭代修正模型猜想，将推测模型量化为有限马尔可夫模型，并使用动态规划进行高效的在线响应规划。

Result: 理论证明贝叶斯学习相对于信息反馈具有渐近一致性，建立了模型错误设定和量化误差的界限。在CAGE-2基准测试中，MOBAL在适应性和对模型错误设定的鲁棒性方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MOBAL方法有效解决了网络安全事件响应中模型不准确的问题，通过在线学习和模型量化实现了更适应实际攻击场景的响应规划。

Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when
information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most
decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system
model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In
this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for
incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:
Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture
about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,
which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine
effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite
Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic
programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with
respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on
misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark
show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and
robustness to model misspecification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励模型难以捕捉细微的、用户特定的偏好，特别是在数据有限和跨领域的情况下，需要开发能够更好理解个人偏好的奖励模型。

Method: 结合合成数据生成和两阶段训练流程（监督微调后接强化微调），专门设计用于从少量个人示例中识别个人因素。

Result: PersRM-R1在准确性和泛化性方面优于同类规模模型，并能与更大模型的性能相匹配。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发更有效的个性化大语言模型铺平了道路，解决了现有奖励模型在捕捉用户特定偏好方面的局限性。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim
to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during
fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific
preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we
introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework
specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one
or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data
availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach
combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline
consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of
similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy
and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法如上下文提示优化和元学习虽然能提升泛化能力，但内存和计算成本高昂，需要长上下文提示或二阶梯度更新

Method: 基于摊销贝叶斯元学习框架，重新定义LoRA中的任务特定参数和全局参数，使用新超参数平衡重构精度和参数保真度

Result: 在Unified-QA和CrossFit数据集上测试，ABMLL在准确率和预期校准误差方面均优于现有方法，可扩展到Llama3-8B等大模型

Conclusion: ABMLL提供了一种计算高效的解决方案，既能提升大语言模型的泛化性能，又能改善不确定性量化，适用于大规模模型

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a
cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However,
it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well
it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve
generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning
to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and
computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of
parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these
challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This
method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting
this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We
reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a
set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity
of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective
generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a
result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty
quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that
it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy
and expected calibration error.

Method: 基于信息瓶颈理论框架，在模型灵活性足够和无冲突标签的假设条件下，通过理论分析和实验验证标签平滑与信息瓶颈最优解的关系。

Result: 理论证明和实验表明标签平滑确实能够探索信息瓶颈的最优解，并且具有对无关信息不敏感的特性，验证了其作为信息瓶颈方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 标签平滑可以解释为一种实用的信息瓶颈实现方法，不仅提供了简单的实现方式，还具备信息瓶颈方法的理想特性，为理解和使用标签平滑技术提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: This study revisits label smoothing via a form of information bottleneck.
Under the assumption of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels
for the same input, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the
model output obtained through label smoothing explores the optimal solution of
the information bottleneck. Based on this, label smoothing can be interpreted
as a practical approach to the information bottleneck, enabling simple
implementation. As an information bottleneck method, we experimentally show
that label smoothing also exhibits the property of being insensitive to factors
that do not contain information about the target, or to factors that provide no
additional information about it when conditioned on another variable.

Motivation: 当前基于分数的图生成模型在药物发现等关键应用中效果显著，但其理论行为特别是收敛性仍未得到充分探索。SGGMs涉及合曲SDE系统，使得现有SGMs的收敛分析无法直接应用

Method: 采用非方式收敛分析方法，研究三种图生成范式：固定图结构的特征生成、固定节点特征的图结构生成、以及两者联合生成。分析收敛界（生成错误风险）并探索图结构拓扑性质等因素的影响

Result: 发现SGGMs的收敛界受到图结构拓扑性质等特有因素的影响，为超参数选择（如采样步数、滴流长度）提供理论指导，建议通过规一化等技术改善收敛性。综合实验结果验证了理论预测

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对SGGMs理论行为的理解，证明了其在关键领域的应用潜力，为设计高效模型提供了重要的理论基础和实践指南

Abstract: Score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) have proven effective in critical
applications such as drug discovery and protein synthesis. However, their
theoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains
underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are
governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a
system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are
governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing
convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present
the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the
convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph
generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)
graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation
of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique
factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph
structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer
theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling
steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to
improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a
controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align
with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical
understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,
and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.

Motivation: 针对油气产量预测中样本外预测鲁棒性不足和不确定性量化困难的问题，研究旨在开发一个结合领域知识和先进机器学习技术的框架来提高预测可靠性。

Method: 采用生产力指数驱动的特征选择方法降低输入维度，结合归纳共形预测进行不确定性量化，并使用LSTM、BiLSTM、GRU和XGBoost等多种算法进行多变量时间序列预测。

Result: LSTM模型表现最佳，在PF14井测试集和样本外预测数据上分别获得19.468和29.638的最低MAE，PI特征选择有效降低了输入维度，ICP框架提供了可靠的预测区间。

Conclusion: 研究表明将领域专业知识与先进机器学习技术相结合，能够显著提高油气产量预测的可靠性，为复杂非正态数据的预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This research introduces a new ML framework designed to enhance the
robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting, specifically
addressing multivariate time series analysis. The proposed methodology
integrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived
from reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for
rigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve
(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the
efficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).
All the models achieved "out-of-sample" production forecasts for an upcoming
future timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using
traditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and
Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing
capabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input
dimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The
uncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a
distribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,
95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a
distinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for
complex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the
LSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample
forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well
E1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining
domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the
reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts.

*Hugo Sales Corrêa,Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Daniel Ratton Figueiredo,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种统计方法来检验相似性选择中的IIA假设，发现显著违反IIA的现象，表明需要新的考虑情境效应的相似性选择模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相似性选择数据在信息检索和嵌入学习等场景中很常见，但传统的基于度量的模型假设无关选项独立性(IIA)。虽然IIA违反在其他离散选择场景中已被发现，但在相似性选择领域研究较少，因为目标依赖的特性使IIA检验变得复杂。

Method: 提出了两种统计检验方法：经典的拟合优度检验和基于后验预测检查(PPC)的贝叶斯方法。收集了两个数据集：一个设计用于引发IIA违反，另一个来自相同项目宇宙的随机选择集。还设计了新的PPC检验来测试群体同质性。

Result: 在两个数据集上都确认了显著的IIA违反，且发现两个数据集的违反程度相当。群体同质性检验显示群体确实是同质的，表明IIA违反是由选择集内的情境效应驱动的。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要开发新的相似性选择模型来考虑此类情境效应，因为传统的IIA假设在相似性选择场景中不成立。

Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives
based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information
retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of
similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a
property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been
detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has
received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the
choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for
IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the
framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our
main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its
mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to
elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the
same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both
datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.
Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that
the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are
driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets.
These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account
for such context effects.

Abstract: Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small
input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by
training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using
specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more
efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are
adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust
fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the
model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss
objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,
and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust
generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when
exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these
design choices influence generalization remains an open question with
significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study
spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3
adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200
robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this
is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.
While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are
increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in
a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both
confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising
research directions and offering practical guidance.

Motivation: 传统REC基准仅依赖图像内线索或缺乏细粒度标注，无法充分评估多模态大语言模型的推理能力，需要新的知识密集型基准。

Method: 构建基于真实世界知识的KnowDR-REC数据集，包含细粒度多模态推理需求、精心构造的负样本（通过表达式编辑）和三个新评估指标来系统探索模型内部推理过程。

Result: 评估16个最先进多模态模型，发现现有MLLMs在知识驱动视觉定位任务中表现不佳，存在文本理解与视觉定位的解耦现象，受记忆化捷径相关性严重影响。

Conclusion: 该基准将推动开发更鲁棒、可解释和知识密集型的视觉定位框架，促进复杂真实场景下更可靠多模态系统的发展。

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that
aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given
textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models,
traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack
sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,
characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world
knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.
Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via
fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and
anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics
to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate
16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results
showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual
grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual
understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are
significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely
affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.
We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards
developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding
frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal
systems for complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP),
a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong
performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement
learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous
learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is
overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the
human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided
by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of
learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a
sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found
that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in
continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC
implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model
(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks
incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP
performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models
on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.
Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the
network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new
tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to
RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors
into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

TL;DR: DualNILM是一个基于Transformer的多任务学习框架，用于解决智能家居中分布式能源接入对非侵入式负荷监测性能的影响问题，能够同时准确识别电器状态和注入能量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着太阳能板、电池储能等分布式能源在智能家居中的普及，这些表后能源的注入能量会掩盖单个电器的功率特征，导致传统仅依赖电表数据的NILM方法性能显著下降。

Method: 提出了DualNILM深度多任务学习框架，在基于Transformer的架构中整合sequence-to-point和sequence-to-sequence策略，有效捕捉聚合功率消耗模式中的多尺度时间依赖性。

Result: 在包含电器级能耗和能量注入的自收集和合成开源NILM数据集上进行验证，实验结果表明DualNILM在双任务上保持优异性能，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: DualNILM能够有效解决分布式能源接入带来的NILM挑战，为智能家居和建筑应用中的精细能耗监测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain
fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building
applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy
sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for
conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected
energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of
individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To
address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning
framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and
injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and
sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,
DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the
aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state
recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of
DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that
include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent
performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督回归方法过度依赖伪标签质量，直接回归容易过拟合且难以学习标签分布

Method: 将回归任务转化为离散分布估计任务，使用解耦分布对齐(DDA)方法对齐师生模型的目标桶和非目标桶分布

Result: 在多个领域数据集上的实验表明DRILL具有强泛化能力，优于现有竞争方法

Conclusion: DRILL框架通过离散化处理和分布对齐有效解决了半监督回归中的过拟合和伪标签质量问题

Abstract: Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of
samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently
received considerable attention across various applications, including computer
vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing
semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the
general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods
heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to
learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address
these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation
distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the
semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task
into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to
better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of
overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled
Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket
between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the
student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher.
Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate
that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比自学习的时空数据框架CST，用于从低质量数据中准确推断POI人群流量，解决了标注数据稀缺、复杂时空依赖性和多源数据关联等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于城市传感技术的限制，大多数数据源的质量不足以监测每个POI的人群流量，需要从低质量数据中准确推断人群流量，但面临标注数据稀缺、复杂时空依赖性和多源数据关联三大挑战。

Method: 将人群流量推断问题重新定义为自监督属性图表示学习任务，构建基于POI和距离的空间邻接图，采用对比学习技术利用大量未标注时空数据，使用交换预测方法从相似实例预测目标子图表示，最后用准确人群流量数据进行微调。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，基于大量噪声数据预训练的CST模型始终优于从头训练的模型。

Conclusion: 提出的对比自学习框架能够有效利用未标注时空数据，通过预训练和微调相结合的方式，显著提升了POI人群流量推断的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal
for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个可扩展的参数感知稀疏回归框架，用于从多参数模拟数据中发现可解释的偏微分方程和亚网格尺度闭合模型。该方法在SINDy基础上进行了四项创新，成功从数据中自主发现了Smagorinsky型闭合结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统SINDy方法在处理多参数数据和物理一致性方面的局限性，旨在从数据中自主发现物理上有意义的亚网格尺度闭合模型，而不依赖于先验理论假设。

Method: 基于Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)，提出了四项创新：符号参数化使物理参数在统一回归中变化；维度相似性过滤器确保单位一致性并减少候选库；内存高效的Gram矩阵积累支持批处理；集成共识和系数稳定性分析实现鲁棒模型识别。

Result: 在一维基准测试中可靠地恢复了控制方程。在过滤Burgers数据集上发现了SGS闭合模型τ_SGS = 0.1603·Δ²(∂ū/∂x)²，对应Smagorinsky常数约0.4004。发现模型在滤波器尺度上达到R² = 0.886，相比经典闭合模型具有更好的预测精度。

Conclusion: 该框架能够识别物理上有意义的SGS形式并校准系数，为现有湍流建模方法提供了补充方法，推动了数据驱动闭合发现领域的发展。

Abstract: We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for
discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale
closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations
through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical
parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter
enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries;
memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and
ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model
identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable
recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered
Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} =
0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$,
corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This
represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data
without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and
demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The
framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate
coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling
methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.

Conclusion: EEGDM提供了一种替代当前基础模型的有前景方案，在保持高性能的同时大大降低计算成本

Abstract: While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the
brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning
meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to
limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation
models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer
architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language
models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG
data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large
models often incurred high computational costs during both training and
inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.
In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon
Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured
state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the
temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were
then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion
transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple
University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art
approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method
outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight.
These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current
FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling
large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has
inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However,
applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to
the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs
dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle
physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new
dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of
downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel
self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural
scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen
weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline
models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust
data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations
extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single
linear mapping for different downstream tasks.

TL;DR: CoBAD是一个用于检测人类移动集体异常的新模型，通过两阶段注意力机制建模个体移动模式和个体间交互，能够检测意外共现异常和缺失异常，在多个指标上显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法主要关注个体移动模式，而集体异常检测需要建模个体间的时空依赖关系，这是一个未被充分探索的挑战。现有方法往往忽视了集体行为中的异常检测需求。

Method: 提出CoBAD模型，首先将问题表述为基于集体事件序列(CES)和共现事件图的无监督学习。采用两阶段注意力机制分别建模个体移动模式和多个体间交互，通过掩码事件和链接重构任务在大规模集体行为数据上进行预训练。

Result: 在大规模移动数据集上的广泛实验表明，CoBAD显著优于现有异常检测基线方法，在AUCROC指标上提升13%-18%，在AUCPR指标上提升19%-70%。

Conclusion: CoBAD成功解决了集体移动行为异常检测的挑战，能够有效检测两种类型的集体异常（意外共现异常和缺失异常），为公共安全和城市规划等应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as
public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods
primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at
home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in
collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home
alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.
Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling
spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional
complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to
capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first
formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences
(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event
sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention
mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions
across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior
data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to
detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies
and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior
work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that
CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving
an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR. All source code is

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从具有评分函数的图神经网络中提取可解释Datalog规则的方法，通过使GNN和评分函数单调化来保证规则提取的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN可解释性方法主要针对低表达能力图编码方法，而忽略了更通用的基于评分函数的链接预测方法，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 通过使GNN和评分函数单调化，利用单调性提取可靠的解释规则，并为特定类别的单调GNN定义等价Datalog程序转换过程。

Result: 实验表明，在链接预测基准测试中，单调GNN和评分函数在实践中表现良好，并能产生大量可靠的规则。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将可解释性扩展到基于评分函数的GNN链接预测，为理解GNN决策提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction:
predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack
of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs
with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to
explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the
expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a
form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph
encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular
approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN
output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be
adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for
explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules
that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining
equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring
functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic
GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.

Method: 设计物理信息奖励机(pRMs)作为符号化机器，开发能够利用pRMs的强化学习算法，通过反事实经验生成和奖励塑形技术来加速学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，在有限和连续物理环境中的多个控制任务上，使用pRMs显著提高了学习效率，加速了训练阶段的奖励获取。

Conclusion: 物理信息奖励机(pRMs)提供了更可编程、表达力更强且高效的强化学习方法，通过将环境知识与未知部分分离，有效降低了样本复杂度并加速了学习过程。

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian
rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness
and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the
environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and
must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such
as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample
complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines
(pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and
reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable,
expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of
exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our
experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition
during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and
effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous
physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly
improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is
expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be
procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained
alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize
examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes
and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same
unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample
evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields
the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield
the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder
examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These
findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training:
prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning
tasks when using GRPO.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order
relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains,
including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural
networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn
latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive
tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small
number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then
utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a
cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego
long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly
increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also
degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture
long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.
Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency
issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing
hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more
information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit
Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns
fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end
manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we
introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model
efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node
classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in
most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in
managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly
pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking
spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability
of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing
efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a
smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps,
mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture
parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive
days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require
any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to
provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location
services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to
specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear
Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR),
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was
employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of
Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142
and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an
LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.

<details>

Motivation: 设计既满足性能目标又保持经济性和可持续性的形状记忆合金是一个复杂挑战，需要平衡马氏体起始温度目标和成本最小化。

Method: 使用两种机器学习模型（树集成模型和神经网络）作为代理预测器，配合不同的优化算法（COBYLA和TRUST-CONSTR）来搜索合适的合金组合。数据集基于实验表征的合金和物理信息特征。

Result: 两种模型预测精度相似，但神经网络配合梯度优化器能更稳定地找到更好的解决方案。COBYLA经常收敛到次优结果，特别是初始猜测远离目标时。

Conclusion: 研究展示了结合物理信息数据、机器学习模型和优化算法探索新形状记忆合金成分的实用方法，虽然数据集规模较小，但使用实验数据提高了预测可靠性，该方法可扩展到其他材料设计领域。

Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while
remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we
focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start
temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning
models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to
search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine
learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of
experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The
tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the
neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a
gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both
models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural
network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to
suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target.
The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching
alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a
practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining
physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms.
Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the
use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The
approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be
made with limited data.

TL;DR: ERIS框架通过能量引导校准、权重正交性和对抗训练实现时间序列分类中的特征解耦，在四个基准测试中平均准确率提升4.04%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列分类方法在处理分布外数据时存在困难，因为模型会混淆领域特定特征和标签相关特征，导致虚假相关性。现有特征解耦方法缺乏语义指导，无法有效分离通用特征

Method: 提出ERIS端到端框架，包含三个关键机制：1)能量引导校准机制提供语义指导；2)权重级正交性策略强制结构独立性；3)辅助对抗训练机制注入结构化扰动增强鲁棒性

Result: 在四个基准测试中，ERIS相比最先进基线方法平均准确率提升4.04%

Conclusion: ERIS框架通过引入语义指导的能量校准机制，结合正交约束和对抗训练，成功实现了更可靠的特征解耦，显著提升了时间序列分类在分布外数据上的性能

Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant
representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models
inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in
spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,
current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required
to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework
to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that
effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also
semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key
mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an
energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance
for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a
weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between
domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their
interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances
robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that
ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy
across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该框架为动态模态测试环境提供了有效的自适应传感器布局解决方案，具有实际工程应用价值

Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing
essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering
industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves
complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions
that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to
test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without
accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes
on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have
been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies
often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations,
this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive
sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The
framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable
Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement
learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case
study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed
method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its
robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统宏观基本图估计需要大量环形检测器数据，但实际应用中往往数据稀缺。需要一种能够跨城市泛化、适应不同检测器配置和拓扑结构的方法。

Method: 开发基于元学习的多任务物理信息神经网络框架，利用多个城市的数据进行训练，能够适应新城市的不同检测器配置和拓扑结构。

Conclusion: 元学习框架有效解决了检测器数据稀缺问题，能够跨不同城市设置进行泛化，为有限检测器条件下的宏观基本图估计提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe
traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic
control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network
requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in
practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a
subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to
new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed
model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and
exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of
detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is
applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically
designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow
prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop
detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes
across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited
data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number
of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against
traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a
non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.

TL;DR: STAS框架通过时空自适应计算时间方法，解决了脉冲神经网络在视觉Transformer中的高延迟和计算开销问题，显著降低能耗同时提升准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络(SNNs)虽然比人工神经网络更节能，但由于多时间步操作特性导致高延迟和计算开销。现有的动态计算方法分散且不统一，自适应计算时间(ACT)原则虽然提供了统一基础，但在SNN-based视觉Transformer中存在时间相似性前提违反和静态架构不匹配的问题

Method: 提出STAS框架，包含集成脉冲补丁分割(I-SPS)模块来建立时间稳定性，创建统一输入表示；以及自适应脉冲自注意力(A-SSA)模块，在空间和时间维度上进行二维token剪枝

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上验证，STAS分别降低能耗45.9%、43.8%和30.1%，同时准确率超过最先进模型

Conclusion: STAS通过协同设计静态架构和动态计算策略，成功解决了SNN-based视觉Transformer中的关键挑战，实现了能耗显著降低和性能提升的统一解决方案

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural
networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to
their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation
methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or
architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the
principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a
unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is
hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity
prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its
principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal
Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that
co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS
introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish
temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving
the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn,
allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform
two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes.
Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%,
and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA
models.

Motivation: 受到生物神经回路模块化、层次化和稀疏连接结构的启发，探索如何将神经科学发现（特别是小鼠视觉皮层的集合间通信模式）应用于人工神经网络设计，以在计算效率、功能专业化和鲁棒性之间取得平衡

Method: 提出G2GNet架构：1）在前馈层间施加稀疏模块化连接；2）结合动态稀疏训练机制，在训练过程中修剪和重新生长连接；3）提出基于激活相关性的类赫布重连规则，模拟生物可塑性原理

Result: 在Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100等标准视觉基准测试中，G2GNet以显著更少的参数实现了比全连接模型更高的准确率（提升达4.3%），同时达到75%的稀疏度，计算量大幅减少

Conclusion: 这是首个将生物观察到的功能连接模式作为结构偏置融入ANN设计的架构，证明了神经科学原理可以为高效神经网络设计提供有价值的指导，在保持性能的同时大幅提升计算效率

Abstract: The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and
sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost,
functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable
insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks
grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for
reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization.
Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of
functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically,
ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet,
a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across
feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully
connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision
benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate
biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in
ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST)
mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a
Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on
principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while
improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer
computations.

Motivation: 智能本质是非遍历的，需要结构化重用先前的推理轨迹而非从零开始的优化，现代AI面临计算瓶颈需要更高效的推理方法

Method: 提出记忆摊销推理(MAI)框架，通过delta同调理论建模认知为在记忆循环上的推理，每个皮质柱作为局部推理算子

Result: 建立了MAI与强化学习的时间反转对偶关系：RL从奖励向前传播价值，MAI从记忆向后重建潜在原因

Conclusion: MAI为基于结构、重用和记忆的智能提供了统一的生物学基础理论，对实现AGI具有深远意义

Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform
sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior
inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a
formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles
in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems
encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling
context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive
systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent
manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of
delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for
Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a
local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we
establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:
whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes
backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient
inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI
thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on
structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications
of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型假设概念条件独立，忽略了概念间的隐藏关系，而实际概念往往相互关联，改变一个概念会影响相关概念。

Method: 提出GraphCBMs，构建潜在概念图来捕捉概念间的关系，与概念瓶颈模型结合，在保持可解释性的同时提升性能。

Result: 在真实图像分类任务中，GraphCBMs在分类性能上表现更优，提供更多概念结构信息，支持更有效的干预，且在不同训练和架构设置下表现稳健。

Conclusion: GraphCBMs通过显式建模概念间关系，显著提升了概念瓶颈模型的性能和可解释性，为深度神经网络提供了更好的解释和干预能力。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep
neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust
final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent
given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships
among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic
structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will
inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose
GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by
constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance
model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment
results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer
the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while
providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to
utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust
in performance across different training and architecture settings.

Conclusion: GLASS提供了一种有效的训练免费动态剪枝方案，能够在保持质量的同时显著减少计算量，特别适合边缘设备上的LLM部署

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive,
prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality.
Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or
incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on
statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation
scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local

training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a
rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics.
Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS
significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in
challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary

Conclusion: RL的奖励函数确实是最佳的过程奖励模型，为LLM中的复杂推理任务提供了稳健且经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen
into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods
that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low
sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently
trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or
LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this
paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and
search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function
learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding
downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to
learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely
eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the
resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a
heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning
chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task
generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including
mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our
unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,
matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,
our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.
These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best
PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex
reasoning tasks in LLMs.

Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and
tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces
FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors
the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by
assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with
periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance
climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble
(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under
different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent
baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and
mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to
transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited
for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a
scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for
physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a

their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant
computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and
processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce
these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the
essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's
predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation
approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level
optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and
original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this
sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn
linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent
and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph
condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a
novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition
(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an
informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.
Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD
effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up
to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive
performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is

Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban
environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite
signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining
positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven
methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the
grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a
robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where
localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the
neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train
the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to
obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon
location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for
positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a
blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using
Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on
labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our
collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning
accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance
for mobile devices.

Conclusion: 研究展示了图结构、GNNs和学习算法之间的耦合关系，为GNN算法设计和选择提供了理论指导和实践启示。

Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph
structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the
learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning
algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude
connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum
degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk
(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the
generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional
settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine
how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several
key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure
and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and
Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure
through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further
explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the
performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we
extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing
non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights
into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning
algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions,
\emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs
and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and
selection in practice.}

Abstract: Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
train agents to make effective decisions in the cybersecurity domain. However,
existing ACO applications require agents to learn from scratch, leading to slow

ACO. In this study, we implement four distinct teacher-guided techniques in the
simulated CybORG environment and conduct a comparative evaluation. Our results
demonstrate that teacher integration can significantly improve training
efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed,
highlighting its potential benefits for autonomous cybersecurity.

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合流匹配和检测模型，有效解决了偷猎预测中的不完善检测和数据稀缺问题，为保护干预措施提供了更准确的预测工具。

Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable
step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform
patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching
prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the
expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent
advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more
flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data
faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited
data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an
occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the
underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite
flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which
is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving
generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show
consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

Motivation: 图扩散生成模型(GDGMs)面临可扩展性和尺寸泛化的挑战，难以处理大规模图且泛化能力有限，限制了在实际应用中的可行性。

Method: 提出随机块图扩散(SBGD)模型，将图表示精炼到块图空间，融入基于真实图模式的结构先验，显著降低内存复杂度。

Conclusion: SBGD不仅是一个可扩展且有效的GDGM，还体现了生成建模中的模块化原则，为通过分解复杂任务探索生成模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces
challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to
scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically
operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in
memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility
for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization,
with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the
training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To
address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion
(SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space.
This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns,
significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large
graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing
fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves
significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable
or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to
unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable
and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in
generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by
decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.

Motivation: 利用大语言模型的新进展来模拟复杂生理系统，为精准医疗、治疗模拟和重症监护中的假设检验提供可信的数字孪生平台。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，每个模拟器针对特定生理系统（如心血管、肾脏、免疫系统）进行监督微调和时间序列数据训练，然后通过强化学习引导的协调机制进行动态参考选择和错误校正。

Result: 在4,509名保留患者上实现高模拟精度（各系统MSE<0.16），外部验证显示在分布偏移下性能稳定。临床医生评估确认真实性和生理合理性（平均评分3.9和3.7），合成数据训练的预警分类器性能下降极小（AUROC下降<0.04）。

Conclusion: Organ-Agents是一个可信、可解释且可推广的数字孪生系统，适用于重症监护中的精准诊断、治疗模拟和假设测试。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new
possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce
Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via
LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,
cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on
system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination
using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from
7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution
trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high
simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and
robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU
patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution
shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical
multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with
coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care
physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert
ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations
under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and
APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early
warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops
(<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results
position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital
twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in
critical care.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战扩散模型需要大量隐状态的传统假设，探索最小化隐状态数量同时保持模型性能的可能性，以提高训练效率和收敛速度。

Method: 1. 精心选择噪声调度策略；2. 在少量隐状态（T~32）下训练扩散模型；3. 进一步推进到单个隐状态的完全解耦；4. 结合多个独立训练的单隐状态模型构建解耦模型。

Result: 1. 少量隐状态（T~32）模型性能与大量隐状态（T~1000）相当；2. 单隐状态解耦模型能够生成高质量样本；3. 解耦模型在两个不同数据集上实现4-6倍的收敛加速。

Conclusion: 扩散模型并不需要大量隐状态，通过合理的噪声调度和模型解耦设计，可以在显著减少计算成本的同时保持生成质量，为高效扩散模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a
large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that
the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with
careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small
number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models
trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we
push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single
latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show
that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model
obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models.
We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model
provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on
two different datasets.

Abstract: Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring,
yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams
is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized
counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring
what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of
lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data
from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a
temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive
relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological
changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered
relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a
counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical
interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via
one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and
impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy
(e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility
(median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant
inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes,
showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides
a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on
individual responses to lifestyle changes.

Motivation: 解决RLVR方法需要昂贵标注数据且仅限于可验证任务的局限性，以及传统对偶学习方法只能应用于严格对偶任务对（如翻译和回译）的问题。

Method: 将原始任务输入分解为已知和未知组件，构建对偶任务来使用原始输出和已知信息重建未知部分（如通过数学解恢复隐藏变量），重建质量作为自监督奖励来优化原始任务。

Result: 在756个翻译方向上平均提升2.13 COMET分数，在三个数学推理挑战基准上平均提升6.4个百分点，作为推理时重排序器性能提升9.3个百分点。

Conclusion: DuPO是一个可扩展、通用且无需标注的LLM优化范式，能够广泛应用于非可逆任务。

Abstract: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that
generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses
two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s
reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and
traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,
translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,
and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several
benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms.
However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the
recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra
systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks
continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these
issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback
mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic
regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by
Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and
TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate of
SymbolicRegression.jl from 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%.
Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's
rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.

Conclusion: 反事实基线为医疗数据提供了更有意义的特征缺失表示，解决了传统基线在医疗解释性中的局限性。

Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge,
particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for
clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated
Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant
features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are
often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where
missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have
been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically
select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of
missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline
selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the
limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but
input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a
meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a
Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our
concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable
counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data
sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more
faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline
choices.

Method: 结合语义聚类和玻尔兹曼能量分布，直接在倒数第二层logits上操作来估计不确定性

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升幻觉检测和不确定性估计性能

Conclusion: Semantic Energy为下游应用提供更可靠的幻觉检测信号，优于传统语义熵方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce
fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making.
Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations.
For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic
diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations.
However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to
capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in
certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel
uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs
by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic
clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better
captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across
multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves
hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable
signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

TL;DR: 本文针对高斯过程模型中的Shapley值计算问题，提出了在二次时间内计算精确Shapley值的方法，解决了传统方法计算复杂度高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley值作为特征重要性归因的经典方法，在机器学习中应用广泛，但其计算复杂度随特征数量呈指数增长，特别是在概率模型（如高斯过程）中，由于输出是随机变量而非点估计，需要额外计算高阶矩，使得计算更加困难。

Method: 针对FANOVA GP这类重要高斯过程模型，利用闭式随机Möbius表示和受牛顿恒等式启发的递归算法，在二次时间内计算精确的局部和全局Shapley值。对于局部解释，定义基于函数分量的随机合作博弈；对于全局解释，引入基于方差的确定性值函数。

Result: 实现了在二次时间内计算精确Shapley值，能够同时捕捉期望贡献和不确定性，量化每个特征对模型整体敏感性的贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了可解释AI的实用性，为结构化概率模型提供了更可扩展、公理上合理且具有不确定性感知能力的解释。

Abstract: Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing
importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact
computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,
severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The
challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as
in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather
than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling
higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class
of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and
interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global
explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise
explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components
and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,
capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global
explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and
compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the
model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)
M\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive
algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean
and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable
AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable,
axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions
generated by structured probabilistic models.

Abstract: This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer
architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address
the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in
cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer
module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using
a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual
semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to
extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and
parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to
dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision,
enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input
modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed,
covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task
scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's
temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate
performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity
analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios,
and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision,
recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection
performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior
capability in complex cloud environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many
applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous
driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic
accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention,
as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this
work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal
trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both
physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based
modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual
nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph
attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future
trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from
psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed
ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions --
and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds
state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling
experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle
trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

Motivation: 标准多层感知机在表示强化学习复杂价值函数时效率不足，需要更有效的特征表示方法

Method: 将切比雪夫多项式基集成到DQN框架中，利用其强大的函数逼近特性构建Ch-DQN架构

Result: 在参数数量相当的情况下，Ch-DQN（N=4）比标准DQN性能提升约39%，但高阶多项式（N=8）反而有害

Conclusion: 验证了正交多项式基在深度强化学习中的潜力，同时强调了模型复杂度选择的重要性

Abstract: The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the
ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the
action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer
perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes
inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel
architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev
polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature
representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of
Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more
efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on
the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a
comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a
moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic
performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also
find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a
high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the
potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning
while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

Motivation: 跨设备联邦学习中部分客户端参与导致的period drift问题尚未得到充分研究，这种漂移比client drift更严重，会随着数据异构性增加而恶化

Method: 提出predict-observe框架和FedEve方法，通过让两种漂移相互补偿来减轻整体影响，理论证明能降低模型更新方差

Result: 理论分析表明方法能减少更新方差，大量实验证明在跨设备非IID数据设置下优于其他方法

Conclusion: period drift是跨设备联邦学习中的重要问题，FedEve通过漂移补偿机制有效解决了这一问题，在异构数据环境下表现突出

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple
clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their private
data. Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in
poor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized
as one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple
local updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift
arises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied
well. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients
at each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that
deviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift
since the optimization objective shifts with every round.
  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client
drift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on
cross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these
issues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated
method, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to
mitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our
approach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in
cross-device settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出两种LLM推理调度算法：保守算法A_max基于预测输出长度上限防止内存溢出，但性能受预测精度影响；自适应算法A_min基于预测下限动态调整，在保证性能的同时实现对数级竞争比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理作为在线多任务服务，能耗高且输出长度未知，需要高效调度算法来降低延迟和功耗，同时处理预测不确定性。

Method: 设计A_max保守算法使用预测上限防止内存溢出；提出A_min自适应算法基于预测下限动态调整输出长度估计，实现高效调度。

Result: A_min算法在数值模拟中表现接近后见之明调度器，具有高效性和鲁棒性，且仅需预测区间下限（比上限更容易准确预测）。

Conclusion: A_min算法通过动态调整和仅依赖预测下限的设计，在LLM推理调度中实现了性能与鲁棒性的良好平衡，为解决输出长度不确定性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference
scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task
service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM
processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,
it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power
consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key
challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known
upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and
processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms
that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the
prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each
request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which
schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to
prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as
prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to
potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted
lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during
inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale
competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,
highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.
Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the
prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output
length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

Result: 该框架为动态拓扑下的分布式SGD算法提供了改进或至少匹配现有工作的收敛理论保证。

Conclusion: 动态拓扑和非均匀聚合策略在分布式SGD中具有重要价值，提出的统一框架为这类算法提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: One of the most common methods to train machine learning algorithms today is
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In a distributed setting, SGD-based
algorithms have been shown to converge theoretically under specific
circumstances. A substantial number of works in the distributed SGD setting
assume a fixed topology for the edge devices. These papers also assume that the
contribution of nodes to the global model is uniform. However, experiments have
shown that such assumptions are suboptimal and a non uniform aggregation
strategy coupled with a dynamically shifting topology and client selection can
significantly improve the performance of such models. This paper details a
unified framework that covers several Local-Update SGD-based distributed
algorithms with dynamic topologies and provides improved or matching
theoretical guarantees on convergence compared to existing work.

Abstract: The prevalence of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches
has inspired growing research on measuring and mitigating bias in the ML
domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in
regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed
to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic
Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However,
there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of
our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness
measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation
algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement
methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates
how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our
experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core
could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and
even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of
various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio
estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further
research to enhance their reliability.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个模糊增强可解释AI框架(FEXAI)，结合模糊逻辑、机器学习和SHAP分析，用于分析连续下降操作(CDO)的性能影响因素，实现了90%以上的分类准确率并提供了可解释的模糊规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续下降操作(CDO)具有减少燃油消耗、排放和噪音等优势，但现有研究缺乏对CDO性能影响因素的系统分析，且相关方法缺乏航空领域所需的透明度和可解释性。

Method: 收集1094个航班的ADS-B数据，包含29个特征(11个操作特征和18个天气特征)。应用机器学习模型和SHAP分析对CDO依从性进行分类和特征重要性排序，然后使用最重要的三个特征构建模糊规则分类器。

Result: 所有模型分类准确率超过90%，识别出平均下降速率、下降段数量和平均航向变化是CDO性能的最强预测因子。FEXAI提供了有意义、人类可读的操作规则。

Conclusion: FEXAI方法为操作决策支持提供了新途径，可集成到航空工具中，在不同操作条件下实现实时建议以保持CDO依从性。

Abstract: Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that
avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving
efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental
benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing
CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as
trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where
explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study
addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)
framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive
dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related
features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then
applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by
importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,
were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the
extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification
accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for
operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the
arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in
directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO
performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway
for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to
enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying
operational conditions.

Motivation: 现有的临床预测模型往往忽略临床概念之间的语义关系，本研究旨在通过整合领域特定的语义信息来改善肺癌预测。

Method: 从SNOMED分类法中构建临床知识图谱，通过黎曼随机梯度下降生成Poincaré嵌入，并将其整合到ResNet和Transformer深度学习架构中。

Result: 使用预训练的Poincaré嵌入相比随机初始化的欧几里得嵌入基线模型，在区分性能上有适度但一致的提升。ResNet模型（特别是10维Poincaré嵌入）显示出更好的校准性能。

Conclusion: 将临床知识图谱嵌入双曲空间并整合到深度学习模型中，可以通过保留临床术语的层次结构来改善肺癌发病预测，展示了数据驱动特征提取与临床知识结合的有效方法。

Abstract: Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data
using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical
concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping
the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using
Poincar\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.
  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived
a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\'e
embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were
then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a
Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute
difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.
  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\'e embeddings resulted in modest
and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline
models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models,
particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\'e embedding, showed enhanced
calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across
configurations.
  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and
integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung
cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical
terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method
for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical
knowledge.

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial
intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to
model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.
However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many
of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.
These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.
In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's
influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive
learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the
sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across
successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we
approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the
need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a
second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to
that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved
by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently
approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the
approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower
approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive
experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset
selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale
vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data
points and outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine

manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive

evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data.
ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics
to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new,
contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that
ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various
domains.

Conclusion: Fair-ICD在适度条件下确保了GNN的公平性，有效解决了现有方法在准确性和公平性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling
graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs
can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.
Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and
message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias
by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge
dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may
unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised
balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we
present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias
mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using
counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node
representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial
discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN
classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs
under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN
backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while
preserving high predictive performance.

Abstract: In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections
while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to
heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques
fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the
spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships
between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual
environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral
domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral
distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that
the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low
to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral
neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection
on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into
homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently,
various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented
graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and
input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with
real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can
be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns.
Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically
selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading
predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have
been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to
non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of
these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this
paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our
benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports
a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that
enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate
representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy,
and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities
of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed
to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key
trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for
future research. The benchmark code is available at:

Abstract: Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with
downstream visual tasks such as video anomaly detection (VAD). Existing Graph
Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for these novel, dataset-less
graphs. We introduce Data-driven GSR (D-GSR), a new paradigm that directly
optimizes graph structure using downstream task data, and propose MissionHD, a
hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework to operationalize it. MissionHD uses
an efficient encode-decode process to refine the graph, guided by the
downstream task signal. Experiments on challenging VAD and VAR benchmarks show
significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating
our approach as an effective pre-processing step.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性和适应性，在药物发现应用中显示出显著优势

Conclusion: CMCM-DLM为分子生成提供了灵活高效的跨模态约束解决方案，能够在不重新训练的情况下适应新约束条件

Abstract: Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically
support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start
of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch
whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve
multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints
may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a
pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but
also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we
propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion
Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:
molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure
Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two
distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM
to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively
anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further
introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated
molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.
Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement
in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放环境中AI代理需要高效学习日益复杂、抽象和异构目标的问题，现有方法依赖专家定义的子目标空间和预训练低级策略，无法适应目标空间自然多样化的开放场景。

Method: 采用两层分层架构：1) 将已掌握目标编译到小型快速神经网络执行的低级策略中；2) 使用LLM作为高级控制器，利用其目标分解和泛化能力在动态演化的子目标空间上操作。

Result: 在Crafter开放环境中验证，HERAKLES能够有效随目标复杂性扩展，通过技能编译提高样本效率，并使代理能够随时间稳健适应新挑战。

Conclusion: HERAKLES框架通过动态技能编译和LLM高级控制，为开放环境中的分层自目标学习提供了有效的解决方案，实现了目标复杂性的可扩展处理和持续适应能力。

Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing
complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling
efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to
keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated
growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent
approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and
language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization
capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing
approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a
hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such
designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally
diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a
framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously
compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast
neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the
high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the
high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and
generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We
evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales
effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill
compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over
time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前治疗性肽设计面临序列空间巨大、实验数据有限、生成模型可解释性差等挑战，需要开发既能优化多药理学特性又具有可解释性的设计方法。

Method: 整合大语言模型(LLMs)与思维链(CoT)监督微调和强化学习(RL)，在序列生成过程中显式推理单体级修改，通过定制奖励函数平衡化学有效性和性质改进。

Result: PepThink-R1生成的环肽在亲脂性、稳定性和暴露度方面显著增强，在优化成功率和可解释性上都优于通用LLMs(如GPT-5)和领域特定基线模型。

Conclusion: 这是首个结合显式推理与RL驱动性质控制的基于LLM的肽设计框架，为治疗发现提供了可靠且透明的肽优化方法。

Abstract: Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the
vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor
interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we
introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly
reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling
interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological
properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity
and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence
variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with
significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming
existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both
optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first
LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with
RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent
peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

Motivation: 现有联邦蒸馏方法需要复杂的知识共享策略和昂贵的统计密度比估计，服务器端过滤引入延迟，需要更高效、轻量级的解决方案

Method: EdgeFD方法使用基于KMeans的密度比估计器有效过滤客户端的内分布和外分布代理数据，提高知识共享质量，无需预训练教师模型

Result: 在强非IID、弱非IID和IID数据分布场景下，EdgeFD优于现有方法，准确率接近IID场景，计算开销显著降低

Conclusion: EdgeFD方法适合资源受限的边缘设备部署，提升了联邦蒸馏的可扩展性和实际应用价值

Abstract: Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine
learning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced
communication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model
outputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing
methods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require
clients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally
expensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side
filtering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address
these challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that
reduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes
the need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based
density ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality
of knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,
including strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,
without requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge
distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID
scenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The
significantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing
the scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation. The
code is available online for reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"上下文引导"的新方法，通过主动指导特征形成过程来改进基于压缩的距离度量，使其更好地适应特定分类或聚类任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于压缩的距离度量虽然灵活且领域无关，但因其相似性特征是从数据中衍生而非预定义，往往难以与具体任务对齐，特别是在复杂的聚类或分类场景中

Method: 通过系统分析每个对象在聚类框架内如何影响关系上下文，主动"引导"特征形成过程，生成定制化的嵌入来隔离和放大类别区分信息

Result: 在异构数据集（从文本到真实世界音频）上的实验验证了上下文引导方法的鲁棒性和通用性，为常见的转导方法提供了有效替代方案

Conclusion: 该方法标志着应用的根本转变：从仅仅发现固有数据结构转向主动塑造针对特定目标定制的特征空间

Abstract: Compression-based distances (CD) offer a flexible and domain-agnostic means
of measuring similarity by identifying implicit information through
redundancies between data objects. However, as similarity features are derived
from the data, rather than defined as an input, it often proves difficult to
align with the task at hand, particularly in complex clustering or
classification settings. To address this issue, we introduce "context
steering," a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping
process. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically
a hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach "steers" the process by
systematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context
within a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored
embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We
validate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression
Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical
clustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.
Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world
audio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking a
fundamental shift in their application: from merely discovering inherent data
structures to actively shaping a feature space tailored to a specific
objective.

Abstract: Model distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from large-scale models
to compact student models, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained
environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from
computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive
distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of
high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest
neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the
embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student
learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight
teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling
direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard
NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently
matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3%
on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise
of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and
effective model compression.

Abstract: Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex
and costly annotation projects remains under-discussed. This is partly due to
the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and
interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific
domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range
widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from
mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper
provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a
focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in
managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts
including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data
availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various
human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation
quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and
frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of
manual annotation projects across various fields.

TL;DR: 提出Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM)框架，通过直接修改源分布而非向量场来实现生成模型引导，保持预训练向量场不变，降低引导问题为源分布采样问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型引导方法通过修改概率流向量场来添加引导场，但这种方法可能破坏预训练模型的特性。本文旨在开发一种保持向量场完整性的引导框架。

Method: SGFM框架直接修改源分布，保持预训练向量场不变。将引导问题转化为从源分布采样的明确定义问题，允许用户根据具体问题灵活选择采样方法。

Result: 理论证明SGFM能精确恢复目标分布，提供使用近似采样器和近似向量场时的Wasserstein误差界限。在合成2D基准、图像数据集和物理信息生成任务上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: SGFM框架提供了灵活且理论保证的生成模型引导方法，特别适合与最优流匹配模型集成，保持直线传输映射的特性。

Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the
probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this
paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,
which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained
vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined
problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that
SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide
bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an
approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.
The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose
the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we
systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for
asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with
optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the
vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,
image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

Result: 在8个基准数据集上的实验表明，CoEBA显著优于其他最先进的链接预测模型

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验验证了节点度分布在对比学习链接预测中的重要性，提出的EBA增强和对比损失有效提升了模型性能

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which
motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the
performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the
lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and
ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To
address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis
for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can
generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive
learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph
augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the
node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach,
named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA),
that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to
improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets.
The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the
other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

Result: 预测方法能获得竞争性能，但与在标准方法投入更多资源相比不具帕納打最优，因需要完整学习曲线训练数据

Conclusion: 预测方法有潜力，但需要利用现有学习曲线数据来减轻对完整运行曲线的依赖

Abstract: Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization
which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However,
the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make
resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow
starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate
whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on
Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a
large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures
and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the
standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show
that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is
not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard
approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data.
However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve
data.

Abstract: What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem
of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models,
each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no
access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take
insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a
singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we
reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized
Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization
approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural
weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but
enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME
produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and
model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results
suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight
aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major
challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers
appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on
inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of
continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to
selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary
models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete
tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.
We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed
one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient
descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot
encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We
provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement
an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.
Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to
three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four
adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In
addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial
suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of
optimized suffixes to different LLMs.

Method: 设计了两步图结构学习增强器优化节点邻域，并通过变分近似推导可处理的时序图信息瓶颈目标函数来正则化边和特征。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的链接预测任务中，GTGIB在归纳设置下优于所有现有方法，在转导设置下也有显著一致的改进。

Conclusion: GTGIB框架通过整合图结构学习和时序图信息瓶颈，有效解决了动态网络中归纳表示学习的关键挑战，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges
evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive
representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges:
effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph
information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph
Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We
design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize
node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through
theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by
extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing
both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function
via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization.
GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets;
they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting,
with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

TL;DR: 提出Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM)，通过数据感知的各向异性噪声缩放改进扩散模型性能，在多个数据集上实现FID提升15%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型使用各向同性高斯噪声，忽略了数据结构。受量子压缩态根据海森堡不确定性原理重新分布不确定性的启发，希望通过对主成分方向进行各向异性噪声缩放来更好地学习数据特征

Method: 研究两种配置：(i) 海森堡扩散模型-在主轴上缩放噪声并在正交方向进行逆缩放补偿；(ii) 标准SDM变体-仅缩放主轴。意外发现适度的反压缩（增加主轴方差）效果最佳

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100和CelebA-64数据集上，轻度反压缩使FID持续提升达15%，并将精度-召回边界向更高召回率方向移动

Conclusion: 简单的数据感知噪声整形可以在不改变架构的情况下提供稳健的生成增益，证明了数据相关噪声缩放的有效性

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding
structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states
redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we
introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically
along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling
noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning
important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg
diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse
scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales
only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,
mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -
consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier
toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise
shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型变大和训练成本增加，需要在固定计算预算下实现计算优化扩展。虽然语言模型领域已有相关研究，但强化学习领域的计算扩展研究相对缺乏。

Method: 研究在线价值基于深度RL方法的计算扩展，分析模型容量和更新到数据比例(UTD)两个主要轴线。通过实验探索不同模型大小、批处大小和UTD比例的组合效果。

Result: 发现了TD-过拟合现象：小模型中增加批处大小会快速损害Q函数准确性，但大模型中没有这种效应，从而能够有效使用大批处。得到了选择批处大小和UTD以优化计算使用的指南。

Conclusion: 研究为深度RL领域的计算优化扩展提供了基础性的开始点，类似于监督学习中的研究，但适配了TD学习的特性。

Abstract: As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes
increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and
more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal
performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for
language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in
this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,
value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute
allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed
compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes
to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between
model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we
call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for
small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use
of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this
phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize
compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for
compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning
but adapted to TD learning.

Motivation: 特征选择和重要性估计在模型无关设置中是一个持续挑战。包装方法虽然计算密集但因其模型无关性而被广泛使用，需要比较不同方法的相对效率。

Method: 采用理论比较和实证分析相结合的方法，在三种模型设置（线性模型、非线性加性模型、单指标模型）下比较GCM和LOCO方法，并通过模拟实验和真实数据分析验证理论结果。

Result: 理论和实证结果表明，在适当的正则条件下，GCM相关方法通常优于LOCO方法。研究量化了这些方法的渐近相对效率，并在神经网络和梯度提升树等机器学习方法上进行了验证。

Conclusion: GCM相关的特征选择方法在效率和性能上优于LOCO方法，为模型无关的特征重要性估计提供了更有效的解决方案，特别是在现代机器学习模型如神经网络和梯度提升树中表现良好。

Abstract: Feature selection and importance estimation in a model-agnostic setting is an
ongoing challenge of significant interest. Wrapper methods are commonly used
because they are typically model-agnostic, even though they are computationally
intensive. In this paper, we focus on feature selection methods related to the
Generalized Covariance Measure (GCM) and Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO)
estimation, and provide a comparison based on relative efficiency. In
particular, we present a theoretical comparison under three model settings:
linear models, non-linear additive models, and single index models that mimic a
single-layer neural network. We complement this with extensive simulations and
real data examples. Our theoretical results, along with empirical findings,
demonstrate that GCM-related methods generally outperform LOCO under suitable
regularity conditions. Furthermore, we quantify the asymptotic relative
efficiency of these approaches. Our simulations and real data analysis include
widely used machine learning methods such as neural networks and gradient
boosting trees.

Motivation: 随着机器学习方法在生存分析中的快速发展，C-index作为广泛使用的判别性能评估指标，在不同软件实现中存在不一致性，这威胁到研究的可重复性和模型间的公平比较

Conclusion: 强调需要更好的报告标准来提高透明度和可重复性，为分析人员提供统一文档并指出现有软件的潜在陷阱，所有代码已公开

Abstract: Quantifying out-of-sample discrimination performance for time-to-event
outcomes is a fundamental step for model evaluation and selection in the
context of predictive modelling. The concordance index, or C-index, is a widely
used metric for this purpose, particularly with the growing development of
machine learning methods. Beyond differences between proposed C-index
estimators (e.g. Harrell's, Uno's and Antolini's), we demonstrate the existence
of a C-index multiverse among available R and python software, where seemingly
equal implementations can yield different results. This can undermine
reproducibility and complicate fair comparisons across models and studies. Key
variation sources include tie handling and adjustment to censoring.
Additionally, the absence of a standardised approach to summarise risk from
survival distributions, result in another source of variation dependent on
input types. We demonstrate the consequences of the C-index multiverse when
quantifying predictive performance for several survival models (from Cox
proportional hazards to recent deep learning approaches) on publicly available
breast cancer data, and semi-synthetic examples. Our work emphasises the need
for better reporting to improve transparency and reproducibility. This article
aims to be a useful guideline, helping analysts when navigating the multiverse,
providing unified documentation and highlighting potential pitfalls of existing
software. All code is publicly available at:
