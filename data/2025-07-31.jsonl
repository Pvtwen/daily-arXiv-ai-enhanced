A commonly used model\nassumes that the data matrices are noisy observations of low-rank matrices with\na shared singular subspace. In this case, two primary methods have emerged for\nestimating this shared structure, which vary in how they integrate information\nacross datasets. The first approach, termed Stack-SVD, concatenates all the\ndatasets, and then performs a singular value decomposition (SVD). The second\napproach, termed SVD-Stack, first performs an SVD separately for each dataset,\nthen aggregates the top singular vectors across these datasets, and finally\ncomputes a consensus amongst them. While these methods are widely used, they\nhave not been rigorously studied in the proportional asymptotic regime, which\nis of great practical relevance in today's world of increasing data size and\ndimensionality. This lack of theoretical understanding has led to uncertainty\nabout which method to choose and limited the ability to fully exploit their\npotential. To address these challenges, we derive exact expressions for the\nasymptotic performance and phase transitions of these two methods and develop\noptimal weighting schemes to further improve both methods.

Mixed-precision\nquantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between\nefficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization. However, finding the\noptimal precision for each layer is challenging. Recent studies utilizing\nbit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial\ntraining complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose\nMemory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that\naddresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable\ndifferentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model\nweights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs,\nenabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter\nsplitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the\nsimultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.\nExperimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable\nparameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous\nbit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression\nrates.

By combining a high-performance neural network with explainable AI\n(XAI) techniques, we can distill a model's learned strategy into\nhuman-interpretable rules. We apply this approach to the challenging case of\nmonotone matrices, defined by the condition that their inverses are entrywise\nnonnegative.

Here, we\npresent, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic machine-learning\napproach for deriving a practical criterion that distinguishes monotone from\nnon-monotone matrices. After establishing a labelled dataset by randomly\ngenerated monotone and non-monotone matrices uniformly on $(-1,1)$, we employ\ndeep neural network algorithms for classifying the matrices as monotone or\nnon-monotone, using both their entries and a comprehensive set of matrix\nfeatures. By saliency methods, such as integrated gradients, we identify among\nall features, two matrix parameters which alone provide sufficient information\nfor the matrix classification, with $95\\%$ accuracy, namely the absolute values\nof the two lowest-order coefficients, $c_0$ and $c_1$ of the matrix's\ncharacteristic polynomial.

While these methods are widely used, they\nhave not been rigorously studied in the proportional asymptotic regime, which\nis of great practical relevance in today's world of increasing data size and\ndimensionality. This lack of theoretical understanding has led to uncertainty\nabout which method to choose and limited the ability to fully exploit their\npotential. To address these challenges, we derive exact expressions for the\nasymptotic performance and phase transitions of these two methods and develop\noptimal weighting schemes to further improve both methods. Our analysis reveals\nthat while neither method uniformly dominates the other in the unweighted case,\noptimally weighted Stack-SVD dominates optimally weighted SVD-Stack. We extend\nour analysis to accommodate multiple shared components, and provide practical\nalgorithms for estimating optimal weights from data, offering theoretical\nguidance for method selection in practical data integration problems. Extensive\nnumerical simulations and semi-synthetic experiments on genomic data\ncorroborate our theoretical findings."}

The core idea is to construct a stochastic mapping from\nthe input to a high-dimensional latent representation, enabling\nuncertainty-aware prediction of the solution. Specifically, the architecture\nconsists of a confidence-aware encoder and a probabilistic decoder. The encoder\nimplements a high-dimensional latent variable model based on a Gaussian process\n(LVM-GP), where the latent representation is constructed by interpolating\nbetween a learnable deterministic feature and a Gaussian process prior, with\nthe interpolation strength adaptively controlled by a confidence function\nlearned from data. The decoder defines a conditional Gaussian distribution over\nthe solution field, where the mean is predicted by a neural operator applied to\nthe latent representation, allowing the model to learn flexible\nfunction-to-function mapping. Moreover, physical laws are enforced as soft\nconstraints in the loss function to ensure consistency with the underlying PDE\nstructure. Compared to existing approaches such as Bayesian physics-informed\nneural networks (B-PINNs) and deep ensembles, the proposed framework can\nefficiently capture functional dependencies via merging a latent Gaussian\nprocess and neural operator, resulting in competitive predictive accuracy and\nrobust uncertainty quantification.

While the field has seen extensive methodological development,\nits theoretical foundations remain relatively underexplored. Most existing\ntheoretical analyses focus on simplified settings where the source and target\ndomains share the same input space and relate target-domain performance to\nmeasures of domain discrepancy. Although insightful, these analyses may not\nfully capture the behavior of modern approaches that align domains into a\nshared space via feature transformations. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive theoretical study of domain adaptation algorithms based on domain\nalignment. We consider the joint learning of domain-aligning feature\ntransformations and a shared classifier in a semi-supervised setting. We first\nderive generalization bounds in a broad setting, in terms of covering numbers\nof the relevant function classes. We then extend our analysis to characterize\nthe sample complexity of domain-adaptive neural networks employing maximum mean\ndiscrepancy (MMD) or adversarial objectives. Our results rely on a rigorous\nanalysis of the covering numbers of these architectures. We show that, for both\nMMD-based and adversarial models, the sample complexity admits an upper bound\nthat scales quadratically with network depth and width. Furthermore, our\nanalysis suggests that in semi-supervised settings, robustness to limited\nlabeled target data can be achieved by scaling the target loss proportionally\nto the square root of the number of labeled target samples. Experimental\nevaluation in both shallow and deep settings lends support to our theoretical\nfindings."}
