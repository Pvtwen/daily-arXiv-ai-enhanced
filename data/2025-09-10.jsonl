Recent advances have introduced flexible neural network\napproaches for improved predictive performance.

To\nselect the number of subgroups, we introduce a post-training refinement that\nreduces the number of equivalent latent subgroups by merging similar groups. We\nperform comprehensive studies to demonstrate ADHAM's interpretability at the\npopulation, subgroup, and individual levels.

However, the normalization may obscure useful\ncharacteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the\nover-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and\nnon-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (\nNSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization\nand non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the\npredictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from\none-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden\nperiodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of\nover-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.\n125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for\nvalidation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the\nproposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for\ntrams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively."}

Unlike\nconventional fixed-position antenna (FPA), the MA array can flexibly adjust\nantenna positions to reconfigure array geometry, for more effectively\nmitigating interference and improving communication performance in ultra-dense\nLEO satellite networks. To reduce movement overhead, we configure antenna\npositions at the antenna initialization stage, which remain unchanged during\nthe whole communication period of the ground station. To this end, an\noptimization problem is formulated to maximize the average achievable rate of\nthe ground station by jointly optimizing its antenna position vector (APV) and\ntime-varying beamforming weights, i.e., antenna weight vectors (AWVs). To solve\nthe resulting non-convex optimization problem, we adopt the Lagrangian dual\ntransformation and quadratic transformation to reformulate the objective\nfunction into a more tractable form. Then, we develop an efficient block\ncoordinate descent-based iterative algorithm that alternately optimizes the APV\nand AWVs until convergence is reached. Simulation results demonstrate that our\nproposed MA scheme significantly outperforms traditional FPA by increasing the\nachievable rate at ground stations under various system setups, thus providing\nan efficient solution for interference mitigation in future ultra-dense LEO\nsatellite communication networks."}

Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines.

Theoretically, NestGNNs generalize the classical NL models and\nexisting DNNs in terms of model representation, while retaining the crucial\ntwo-layer substitution patterns of the NL models: proportional substitution\nwithin a nest but non-proportional substitution beyond a nest. Empirically, we\nfind that the NestGNNs significantly outperform the benchmark models,\nparticularly the corresponding NL models by 9.2\\%. As shown by elasticity\ntables and substitution visualization, NestGNNs retain the two-layer\nsubstitution patterns as the NL model, and yet presents more flexibility in its\nmodel design space. Overall, our study demonstrates the power of NestGNN in\nprediction, interpretation, and its flexibility of generalizing the classical\nNL model for analyzing travel mode choice."}

Hadi Sepanj", "Benyamin Ghojogh", "Paul Fieguth"], "title": "Kernel VICReg for Self-Supervised Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space", "comment": null, "summary": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for\nrepresentation learning by optimizing geometric objectives--such as invariance\nto augmentations, variance preservation, and feature decorrelation--without\nrequiring labels. However, most existing methods operate in Euclidean space,\nlimiting their ability to capture nonlinear dependencies and geometric\nstructures. In this work, we propose Kernel VICReg, a novel self-supervised\nlearning framework that lifts the VICReg objective into a Reproducing Kernel\nHilbert Space (RKHS). By kernelizing each term of the loss-variance,\ninvariance, and covariance--we obtain a general formulation that operates on\ndouble-centered kernel matrices and Hilbert-Schmidt norms, enabling nonlinear\nfeature learning without explicit mappings.\n  We demonstrate that Kernel VICReg not only avoids representational collapse\nbut also improves performance on tasks with complex or small-scale data.\nEmpirical evaluations across MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, TinyImageNet, and\nImageNet100 show consistent gains over Euclidean VICReg, with particularly\nstrong improvements on datasets where nonlinear structures are prominent. UMAP\nvisualizations further confirm that kernel-based embeddings exhibit better\nisometry and class separation. Our results suggest that kernelizing SSL\nobjectives is a promising direction for bridging classical kernel methods with\nmodern representation learning."}

Gowin", "Yue Wang", "Martin Paulus", "Ryan Peterson"], "title": "Identifying Neural Signatures from fMRI using Hybrid Principal Components Regression", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in neuroimaging analysis have enabled accurate decoding of\nmental state from brain activation patterns during functional magnetic\nresonance imaging scans. A commonly applied tool for this purpose is principal\ncomponents regression regularized with the least absolute shrinkage and\nselection operator (LASSO PCR), a type of multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA).\nThis model presumes that all components are equally likely to harbor relevant\ninformation, when in fact the task-related signal may be concentrated in\nspecific components. In such cases, the model will fail to select the optimal\nset of principal components that maximizes the total signal relevant to the\ncognitive process under study. Here, we present modifications to LASSO PCR that\nallow for a regularization penalty tied directly to the index of the principal\ncomponent, reflecting a prior belief that task-relevant signal is more likely\nto be concentrated in components explaining greater variance. Additionally, we\npropose a novel hybrid method, Joint Sparsity-Ranked LASSO (JSRL), which\nintegrates component-level and voxel-level activity under an information parity\nframework and imposes ranked sparsity to guide component selection. We apply\nthe models to brain activation during risk taking, monetary incentive, and\nemotion regulation tasks. Results demonstrate that incorporating sparsity\nranking into LASSO PCR produces models with enhanced classification\nperformance, with JSRL achieving up to 51.7\\% improvement in cross-validated\ndeviance $R^2$ and 7.3\\% improvement in cross-validated AUC. Furthermore,\nsparsity-ranked models perform as well as or better than standard LASSO PCR\napproaches across all classification tasks and allocate predictive weight to\nbrain regions consistent with their established functional roles, offering a\nrobust alternative for MVPA."}
