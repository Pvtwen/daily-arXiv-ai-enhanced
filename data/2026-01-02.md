<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 工作创新点：扩展已知最优RMRA目录，并建立遵循闭式表达式的次优RMRA家族

Abstract: Modern sparse arrays are maximally economic in that they retain just as many sensors required to provide a specific aperture while maintaining a hole-free difference coarray. As a result, these are susceptible to the failure of even a single sensor. Contrarily, two-fold redundant sparse arrays (TFRSAs) and robust minimum redundancy arrays (RMRAs) ensure robustness against single-sensor failures due to their inherent redundancy in their coarrays. At present, optimal RMRA configurations are known only for arrays with sensor counts N=6 to N=10. To this end, this paper proposes two objectives: (i) developing a systematic algorithm to discover optimal RMRAs for N>10, and (ii) obtaining a new family of near-/sub-optimal RMRA that can be completely specified using closed-form expressions (CFEs). We solve the combinatorial optimization problem of finding RMRAs using an exhaustive search technique implemented in MATLAB. Optimal RMRAs for N = 11 to 14 were successfully found and near/sub-optimal arrays for N = 15 to 20 were determined using the proposed technique. As a byproduct of the exhaustive search, a large catalogue of valid near- and sub-optimal RMRAs was also obtained. In the second stage, CFEs for a new TFRSA were obtained by applying pattern mining and algebraic generalizations to the arrays obtained through exhaustive search. The proposed family enjoys CFEs for sensor positions, available aperture, and achievable degrees of freedom (DOFs). The CFEs have been thoroughly validated using MATLAB and are found to be valid for $N\geq8$. Hence, it can be concluded that the novelty of this work is two-fold: extending the catalogue of known optimal RMRAs and formulating a sub-optimal RMRA that abides by CFEs.

TL;DR: 提出基于材料混合专家模型的锂离子电池剩余使用寿命预测方法RUL-QMoE，解决异质电池化学特性带来的预测泛化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are the major type of battery used in a variety of everyday applications, including electric vehicles (EVs), mobile devices, and energy storage systems. Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Li-ion batteries is crucial for ensuring their reliability, safety, and cost-effectiveness in battery-powered systems. The materials used for the battery cathodes and their designs play a significant role in determining the degradation rates and RUL, as they lead to distinct electrochemical reactions. Unfortunately, RUL prediction models often overlook the cathode materials and designs to simplify the model-building process, ignoring the effects of these electrochemical reactions. Other reasons are that specifications related to battery materials may not always be readily available, and a battery might consist of a mix of different materials. As a result, the predictive models that are developed often lack generalizability. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel material-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for predicting the RUL of batteries, specifically addressing the complexities associated with heterogeneous battery chemistries. The MoE is integrated into a probabilistic framework, called Multiple Non-crossing Quantile Mixture-of-Experts for Probabilistic Prediction (RUL-QMoE), which accommodates battery operational conditions and enables uncertainty quantification. The RUL-QMoE model integrates specialized expert networks for five battery types: LFP, NCA, NMC, LCO, and NMC-LCO, within a gating mechanism that dynamically assigns relevance based on the battery's input features. Furthermore, by leveraging non-crossing quantile regression, the proposed RUL-QMoE produces coherent and interpretable predictive distributions of the battery's RUL, enabling robust uncertainty quantification in the battery's RUL prediction.

Abstract: This paper presents a distributed beamforming framework for a constellation of airborne platform stations (APSs) in a massive Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) non-terrestrial network (NTN) that targets the downlink sum-rate maximization under imperfect local channel state information (CSI). We propose a novel entropy-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach where each non-terrestrial base station (NTBS) independently computes its beamforming vector using a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to capture long-range dependencies in the frequency domain. To ensure scalability and robustness, the proposed framework integrates transfer learning based on a conjugate prior mechanism and a low-rank decomposition (LRD) technique, thus enabling efficient support for large-scale user deployments and aerial layers. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over baseline schemes including WMMSE, ZF, MRT, CNN-based DRL, and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method in terms of average sum rate, robustness to CSI imperfection, user mobility, and scalability across varying network sizes and user densities. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method achieves significant computational efficiency compared to CNN-based and WMMSE methods, while reducing communication overhead in comparison with shared-critic DRL approaches.

### [4] [A multimodal Transformer for InSAR-based ground deformation forecasting with cross-site generalization across Europe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23906)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于多模态Transformer的InSAR位移地图单步预测模型，用于EGMS时间序列的下一纪元位移预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近实时区域尺度地面变形监测对城市规划、关键基础设施管理和自然灾害缓解日益重要。虽然InSAR和EGMS提供了密集的历史运动观测，但由于长期趋势、季节周期和突发不连续性的叠加以及空间异质性，预测下一观测仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出多模态基于块的Transformer模型，用于EGMS时间序列的单步固定间隔下一纪元位移预测。模型输入包括近期位移快照、从训练窗口计算的静态运动学指标（平均速度、加速度、季节振幅）以及谐波日编码。

Result: 在爱尔兰东部图块(E32N34)上，多模态Transformer明显优于CNN-LSTM、CNN-LSTM+Attn和多模态STGCN，测试集上达到RMSE=0.90 mm和R²=0.97，具有最佳阈值精度。

Conclusion: 多模态Transformer模型在InSAR位移预测任务中表现出优越性能，为近实时地面变形监测提供了有效的预测工具。

Abstract: Near-real-time regional-scale monitoring of ground deformation is increasingly required to support urban planning, critical infrastructure management, and natural hazard mitigation. While Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and continental-scale services such as the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) provide dense observations of past motion, predicting the next observation remains challenging due to the superposition of long-term trends, seasonal cycles, and occasional abrupt discontinuities (e.g., co-seismic steps), together with strong spatial heterogeneity. In this study we propose a multimodal patch-based Transformer for single-step, fixed-interval next-epoch nowcasting of displacement maps from EGMS time series (resampled to a 64x64 grid over 100 km x 100 km tiles). The model ingests recent displacement snapshots together with (i) static kinematic indicators (mean velocity, acceleration, seasonal amplitude) computed in a leakage-safe manner from the training window only, and (ii) harmonic day-of-year encodings. On the eastern Ireland tile (E32N34), the STGCN is strongest in the displacement-only setting, whereas the multimodal Transformer clearly outperforms CNN-LSTM, CNN-LSTM+Attn, and multimodal STGCN when all models receive the same multimodal inputs, achieving RMSE = 0.90 mm and $R^2$ = 0.97 on the test set with the best threshold accuracies.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance wireless communication performance by exploiting the new degree of freedom (DoF) via antenna position optimization. In this letter, we investigate the MA-enhanced wide beam coverage over multiple subregions in the spatial domain. Specifically, we aim to maximize the minimum beam gain over the desired subregions by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and antenna position vector (APV). Although this problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve it by leveraging the similarity between the considered multi-region coverage and classical multi-notch filter (MNF) design. In particular, we construct a spatial MNF-based transmit beamforming vector by assuming a continuous amplitude and phase-shift profile within the antenna movement region. Based on this continuous profile, we propose a sequential update algorithm to select an optimal subset of MA positions for multi-region coverage, jointly with a Gibbs sampling (GS) procedure to avoid undesired local optimum. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can significantly outperform conventional fixed position antennas (FPAs) and achieve a comparable performance to the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with dramatically lower complexity.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of mega-constellations is driving the long-term vision of space data centers (SDCs), where interconnected satellites form in-orbit distributed computing and learning infrastructures. Enabling distributed federated learning in such systems is challenging because iterative training requires frequent aggregation over inter-satellite links that are bandwidth- and energy-constrained, and the link conditions can be highly dynamic. In this work, we exploit over-the-air computation (AirComp) as an in-network aggregation primitive. However, conventional coherent AirComp relies on stringent phase alignment, which is difficult to maintain in space environments due to satellite jitter and Doppler effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose OptiVote, a robust and communication-efficient non-coherent free-space optical (FSO) AirComp framework for federated learning toward Space Data Centers. OptiVote integrates sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) with a majority-vote (MV) aggregation principle and pulse-position modulation (PPM), where each satellite conveys local gradient signs by activating orthogonal PPM time slots. The aggregation node performs MV detection via non-coherent energy accumulation, transforming phase-sensitive field superposition into phase-agnostic optical intensity combining, thereby eliminating the need for precise phase synchronization and improving resilience under dynamic impairments. To mitigate aggregation bias induced by heterogeneous FSO channels, we further develop an importance-aware, channel state information (CSI)-free dynamic power control scheme that balances received energies without additional signaling. We provide theoretical analysis by characterizing the aggregate error probability under statistical FSO channels and establishing convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives.

Result: 框架允许通信设备在线适应传输频带变化，无需解决NP难优化问题，相比现有方法更灵活高效

Conclusion: 提出的预优化脉冲框架为OFDM信号频谱整形提供了动态适应非连续时变频谱的有效解决方案

Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals with rectangular pulses exhibit low spectral confinement. Shaping their power spectral density (PSD) is imperative in the increasingly overcrowded spectrum to benefit from the cognitive radio (CR) paradigm. However, since the available spectrum is non-contiguous and its occupancy changes with time, the spectral shaping solution has to be dynamically adapted. This work proposes a framework that allows using a reduced set of preoptimized pulses to shape the spectrum of OFDM signals, irrespective of its spectral width and location, by means of simple transformations. The employed pulses combine active interference cancellation (AIC) and adaptive symbol transition (AST) terms in a transparent way to the receiver. They can be easily adapted online by the communication device to changes in the location or width of the transmission band, which contrasts with existing methods of the same type that require solving NP-hard optimization problems.

Conclusion: Wigner-Ville变换作为信息测量工具在信号处理中具有重要应用价值，特别适用于检测微弱瞬态信号和资源受限场景，有望推动多个相关应用领域的进步

Abstract: This paper presents novel interpretations to the field of classical signal processing of the Wigner-Ville transform as an information measurement tool. The transform's utility in detecting and localizing information-laden signals amidst noisy and cluttered backgrounds, and further providing measure of their information volumes, are detailed herein using Tsallis' entropy and information and related functionals. Example use cases in radio frequency communications are given, where Wigner-Ville-based detection measures can be seen to provide significant sensitivity advantage, for some shown contexts greater than 15~dB advantage, over energy-based measures and without extensive training routines. Such an advantage is particularly significant for applications which have limitations on observation resources including time/space integration pressures and transient and/or feeble signals, where Wigner-Ville-based methods would improve sensing effectiveness by multiple orders of magnitude. The potential for advancement of several such applications is discussed.

Abstract: With great flexibility to adjust antenna positions, pinching antennas (PAs) are promising for alleviating large-scale attenuation in wireless networks. In this work, we investigate the antenna positioning and beamforming (AP-BF) design in a multi-PA multi-user system under probabilistic light-of-sight (LoS) blockage and formulate a power minimization problem subject to per-user signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints. For a single PA, we prove the convexity of the simplified problem and obtain its global optimum. For multiple PAs, we derive closed-form BF structures and develop an efficient first-order algorithm to achieve high-quality local solutions. Extensive numerical results validate the efficacy of our proposed designs and the substantial performance advantage of PA systems compared with conventional fixed-antenna systems in a term of power saving.

Abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental physical layer conflict in hybrid Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) between high-throughput primary communication and the stringent power envelope requirements of passive backscatter sensors. We propose a Backscatter-Constrained Transmit Antenna Selection (BC-TAS) framework, a per-subcarrier selection strategy for multi-antenna illuminators operating within a Multi-Dimensional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MD-OFDM) architecture. Unlike conventional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) centric selection schemes, BC-TAS employs a multi-objective cost function that jointly maximizes desired link reliability, stabilizes the incident RF energy envelope at passive Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) sensors, and suppresses interference toward coexisting victim receivers. By exploiting the inherent sparsity of MD-OFDM, the proposed framework enables dual-envelope regulation, simultaneously reducing the transmitter Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and the Backscatter Crest Factor (BCF) observed at the tag. To enhance robustness under imperfect Channel State Information (CSI), a Kalman-based channel smoothing mechanism is incorporated to maintain selection stability in low-SNR regimes. Numerical results using IEEE 802.11be dispersive channel models and a nonlinear Rapp power amplifier demonstrate that BC-TAS achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in outage probability and significant gains in energy efficiency compared to conventional MU-MIMO baselines, while ensuring spectral mask compliance under reduced power amplifier back-off. These results establish BC-TAS as an effective illuminator-side control mechanism for enabling reliable and energy-stable sensing and communication coexistence in dense, power-constrained wireless environments.

*Borui Du,Yumeng Zhang,Christos Masouros,Bruno Clerckx*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究OTFS双功能雷达通信系统的最优信号设计，通过交替优化框架平衡雷达与通信性能，相比传统OTFS信号显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OTFS信号在高移动性无线环境中具有优势，但长帧持续时间在雷达和通信分离执行时会引入显著延迟。采用双功能雷达通信模式可同时执行感知和数据传输，减少延迟，但最优OTFS DFRC信号策略尚未充分探索。

Method: 推导考虑信道估计误差的OTFS通信信道容量下界指标，以及考虑数据符号随机性和确定性导频符号的雷达综合旁瓣水平指标。基于这些指标构建平衡雷达与通信性能的优化问题，采用交替优化框架求解。

Result: OTFS DFRC强制使用在DD域具有集中峰值的确定性导频信号，为感知和信道估计提供共同结构，数据在其他DD网格复用。相比传统OTFS信号，至少实现9.45 dB的ISL抑制（感知）和4.82 dB的SINR增益（通信）。

Conclusion: OTFS DFRC信号设计在单个OTFS信号中统一了感知和通信功能，通过优化导频符号设计和数据符号功率分配，显著扩展了可实现的感知-通信性能区域。

Abstract: The orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) signal is considered a promising solution for high-mobility wireless environments. It manages Doppler effects by utilizing delay-Doppler (DD) domain processing. However, the relatively long OTFS frame duration could introduce considerable sensing or communication latency when radar and communication are performed separately. By operating in a dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) mode, the OTFS system performs sensing and data transmission simultaneously, thereby reducing the resulting latency. Nevertheless, the optimal OTFS DFRC signal strategy remains insufficiently explored. This paper investigates the optimal signal design for OTFS DFRC systems, focusing on pilot symbol design and data symbol power allocation. Specifically, we derive a channel capacity lower bound metric for communication that considers channel estimation errors in OTFS. For sensing, we derive an integrated sidelobe level (ISL), accounting for the randomness of the data symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. Leveraging the above metrics, we formulate an optimization problem that balances radar and communication performance, and then solve it using an alternating optimization framework. We validate the proposed signal through numerical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. Our analysis shows that OTFS DFRC enforces a deterministic pilot signal that is characterized by a concentrated peak in the DD domain, which furnishes a common structure in the DD domain facilitating sensing and channel estimation, with data multiplexed in other DD grids, thereby unifying sensing and communication within a single OTFS signal. Compared with conventional OTFS signals, the proposed OTFS DFRC signal expands the achievable sensing-communication performance region, delivering at least a 9.45 dB ISL suppression for sensing and a 4.82 dB SINR ratio gain for communication.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical sensing framework for wideband integrated sensing and communications with uniform planar arrays (UPAs). Leveraging the beam-squint effect inherent in wideband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, the proposed framework enables efficient two-dimensional angle estimation through a structured multi-stage sensing process. Specifically, the sensing procedure first searches over the elevation angle domain, followed by a dedicated search over the azimuth angle domain given the estimated elevation angles. In each stage, true-time-delay lines and phase shifters of the UPA are jointly configured to cover multiple grid points simultaneously across OFDM subcarriers. To enable accurate and efficient target localization, we formulate the angle estimation problem as a sparse signal recovery problem and develop a modified matching pursuit algorithm tailored to the hierarchical sensing architecture. Additionally, we design power allocation strategies that minimize total transmit power while meeting performance requirements for both sensing and communication. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over conventional sensing methods with reduced sensing power.

Abstract: To overcome inherent limitations of analog signals in over-the-air computation (AirComp), this letter proposes a two's complement-based coding scheme for the AirComp implementation with compatible digital modulations. Specifically, quantized discrete values are encoded into binary sequences using the two's complement and transmitted over multiple subcarriers. At the receiver, we design a decoder that constructs a functional mapping between the superimposed digital modulation signals and the target of computational results, theoretically ensuring asymptotic error free computation with the minimal codeword length. To further mitigate the adverse effects of channel fading, we adopt a truncated inversion strategy for pre-processing. Benefiting from the unified symbol distribution after the proposed encoding, we derive the optimal linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector in closed form and propose a low complexity algorithm seeking for the optimal truncation selection. Furthermore, the inherent importance differences among the coded outputs motivate an uneven power allocation strategy across subcarriers to improve computational accuracy. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed scheme over existing digital AirComp approaches, especially at low signal to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.

Abstract: Wireless powered integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) faces a fundamental tradeoff between energy supply, communication throughput, and sensing accuracy. This paper investigates a wireless powered ISAC system with target localization requirements, where users harvest energy from wireless power transfer (WPT) and then conduct ISAC transmissions in a time-division manner. In addition to energy supply, the WPT signal also contributes to target sensing, and the localization accuracy is characterized by Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) constraints. Under this setting, we formulate a max-min throughput maximization problem by jointly allocating the WPT duration, ISAC transmission time allocation, and transmit power. Due to the nonconvexity of the resulting problem, a suitable reformulation is developed by exploiting variable substitutions and the monotonicity of logarithmic functions, based on which an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate convergence and significant performance gains over benchmark schemes, highlighting the importance of coordinated time-power optimization in balancing sensing accuracy and communication performance in wireless powered ISAC systems.

Abstract: With the increasing maturity of contactless human pose recognition (HPR) technology, indoor interactive applications have raised higher demands for natural, controller-free interaction methods. However, current mainstream HPR solutions relying on vision or radio-frequency (RF) (including WiFi, radar) still face various challenges in practical deployment, such as privacy concerns, susceptibility to occlusion, dedicated equipment and functions, and limited sensing resolution and range. 5G-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology, by merging communication and sensing functions, offers a new approach to address these challenges in contactless HPR. We propose a practical 5G-based ISAC system capable of inferring 2D HPR from uplink sounding reference signals (SRS). Specifically, rich features are extracted from multiple domains and employ an encoder to achieve unified alignment and representation in a latent space. Subsequently, low-dimensional features are fused to output the human pose state. Experimental results demonstrate that in typical indoor environments, our proposed 5G-based ISAC HPR system significantly outperforms current mainstream baseline solutions in HPR performance, providing a solid technical foundation for universal human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) envisioned for 6G enable high-resolution sensing. However, the ELAAs worked in extremely high frequency will push operation into the near-field region, where spherical wavefronts invalidate classical far-field models and alter fundamental estimation limits. The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part II) is to develop the theory of fundamental limits for near-field sensing systems in detail. In this paper (Part I), we develop a unified narrow-band near-field signal model for joint parameter sensing of moving targets using the ELAAs. Leveraging the Slepian--Bangs formulation, we derive closed-form Cram'er--Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section (RCS) under the slow-time sampling model. To obtain interpretable insights, we further establish explicit far-field and near-field approximations that reveal how the bounds scale with array aperture, target range, carrier wavelength, and coherent integration length. The resulting expressions expose the roles of self-information terms and their cross terms, clarifying when Fresnel corrections become non-negligible and providing beamformer and algorithm design guidelines for near-field sensing with ELAAs. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and their far-field and near-field approximations, demonstrating accurate agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative array sizes and target ranges.

Abstract: Near-field sensing with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) in practical 6G systems is expected to operate over broad bandwidths, where delay, Doppler, and spatial effects become tightly coupled across frequency. The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part I) is to develop the unified Cram'er--Rao bounds (CRBs) for sensing systems spanning from far-field to near-field, and narrow-band to wide-band. This paper (Part II) derives fundamental estimation limits for a wide-band near-field sensing systems employing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signaling over a coherent processing interval. We establish an exact near-field wide-band signal model that captures frequency-dependent propagation, spherical-wave geometry, and the intrinsic coupling between target location and motion parameters across subcarriers and slow time. Similar as Part I using the Slepian--Bangs formulation, we derive the wide-band Fisher information matrix and the CRBs for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section, and we show how wide-band information aggregates across orthogonal subcarriers. We further develop tractable far-field and near-field approximations which provide design-level insights into the roles of bandwidth, coherent integration length, and array aperture, and clarify when wide-band effects. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and its approximations, demonstrating close agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative ranges, bandwidths, and array configurations.

Abstract: Learning systems deployed in nonstationary and safety-critical environments often suffer from instability, slow convergence, or brittle adaptation when learning dynamics evolve over time. While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Achieving provable stability in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) remains a challenge, particularly in balancing exploration with rigorous safety. This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $λ$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control. Source code and benchmark environments will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Online gaming is a popular activity involving the adoption of complex systems and network infrastructures. The relevance of gaming, which generates large amounts of market revenue, drove research in modeling network devices' behavior to evaluate bandwidth consumption, predict and sustain high loads, and detect malicious activity. In this context, process mining appears promising due to its ability to combine data-driven analyses with model-based insights. In this paper, we propose a process mining-based method that analyzes gaming network traffic, allowing: unsupervised characterization of different states from gaming network data; encoding such states through process mining into interpretable Petri nets; and classification of gaming network traffic data to identify different video games being played. We apply the method to the UPSIDE case study, involving gaming network data of several devices interacting with two video games: Clash Royale and Rocket League. Results demonstrate that the gaming network behavior can be effectively and interpretably modeled through states represented as Petri nets with sufficient coherence (94.02% inter-device similarity) and specificity (174.99% inter-state separation) while maintaining a good classification accuracy of the two different video games (73.84% AUC).

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has been widely adopted in diverse industrial domains, including autonomous driving, intelligent healthcare, and aided programming. Like traditional software, DL systems are also prone to faults, whose malfunctioning may expose users to significant risks. Consequently, numerous approaches have been proposed to address these issues. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art DL model fixing approaches, spanning model-level, layer-level, and neuron-level categories, to comprehensively evaluate their performance. We assess not only their fixing effectiveness (their primary purpose) but also their impact on other critical properties, such as robustness, fairness, and backward compatibility. To ensure comprehensive and fair evaluation, we employ a diverse set of datasets, model architectures, and application domains within a uniform experimental setup for experimentation. We summarize several key findings with implications for both industry and academia. For example, model-level approaches demonstrate superior fixing effectiveness compared to others. No single approach can achieve the best fixing performance while improving accuracy and maintaining all other properties. Thus, academia should prioritize research on mitigating these side effects. These insights highlight promising directions for future exploration in this field.

Abstract: For complex simulation problems, inferring parameters of scientific interest often precludes the use of classical likelihood-based techniques due to intractable likelihood functions. Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\mathbfθ$ given observed data $\mathbf{x}_{\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors. The review closes with a discussion of open problems with an eye toward applications of uncertainty quantification for probabilistic geophysical models that may benefit from diffusion-based SBI.

Abstract: Human-level concept learning argues that humans typically learn new concepts from a single example, whereas machine learning algorithms typically require hundreds of samples to learn a single concept. Our brain subconsciously identifies important features and learns more effectively. \vspace*{6pt}
  Contribution: In this paper, we present the Coordinate Matrix Machine (CM$^2$). This purpose-built small model augments human intelligence by learning document structures and using this information to classify documents. While modern "Red AI" trends rely on massive pre-training and energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, CM$^2$ is designed as a Green AI solution. It achieves human-level concept learning by identifying only the structural "important features" a human would consider, allowing it to classify very similar documents using only one sample per class.
  Advantage: Our algorithm outperforms traditional vectorizers and complex deep learning models that require larger datasets and significant compute.

Motivation: 先前研究表明小型transformer在受控环境中可实现精确贝叶斯推理，并产生编码后验结构的几何基底。本研究旨在探究这种几何特征是否存在于生产级语言模型中。

Conclusion: 现代语言模型保留了支持贝叶斯推理的几何基底，并将近似贝叶斯更新沿此基底组织。该几何结构是读取不确定性的特权通道，而非单一计算瓶颈。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that small transformers trained in controlled "wind-tunnel'' settings can implement exact Bayesian inference, and that their training dynamics produce a geometric substrate -- low-dimensional value manifolds and progressively orthogonal keys -- that encodes posterior structure. We investigate whether this geometric signature persists in production-grade language models. Across Pythia, Phi-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, we find that last-layer value representations organize along a single dominant axis whose position strongly correlates with predictive entropy, and that domain-restricted prompts collapse this structure into the same low-dimensional manifolds observed in synthetic settings.
  To probe the role of this geometry, we perform targeted interventions on the entropy-aligned axis of Pythia-410M during in-context learning. Removing or perturbing this axis selectively disrupts the local uncertainty geometry, whereas matched random-axis interventions leave it intact. However, these single-layer manipulations do not produce proportionally specific degradation in Bayesian-like behavior, indicating that the geometry is a privileged readout of uncertainty rather than a singular computational bottleneck. Taken together, our results show that modern language models preserve the geometric substrate that enables Bayesian inference in wind tunnels, and organize their approximate Bayesian updates along this substrate.

Motivation: 基于主观逻辑的证据深度学习模型能够有效量化不确定性，但主观逻辑框架要求证据必须非负，这需要使用特定的激活函数。这些激活函数的几何特性可能导致激活依赖的学习冻结行为：当样本映射到低证据区域时，梯度变得极小，阻碍模型学习。

Method: 首先从理论上分析了激活函数如何影响学习动态，然后设计了一个通用的激活函数家族及相应的证据正则化器。这些方法为不同激活机制下的一致证据更新提供了替代途径。

Result: 在四个基准分类问题（MNIST、CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、Tiny-ImageNet）、两个少样本分类问题以及盲人脸恢复问题上进行了广泛实验，验证了理论分析并证明了所提出的广义正则化证据模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文深入分析了证据深度学习中的激活函数问题，提出了理论解决方案，并通过实验验证了所提方法的有效性，为改进证据深度学习模型的训练动态提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Evidential deep learning (EDL) models, based on Subjective Logic, introduce a principled and computationally efficient way to make deterministic neural networks uncertainty-aware. The resulting evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using learned evidence. However, the Subjective-Logic framework constrains evidence to be non-negative, requiring specific activation functions whose geometric properties can induce activation-dependent learning-freeze behavior: a regime where gradients become extremely small for samples mapped into low-evidence regions. We theoretically characterize this behavior and analyze how different evidential activations influence learning dynamics. Building on this analysis, we design a general family of activation functions and corresponding evidential regularizers that provide an alternative pathway for consistent evidence updates across activation regimes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark classification problems (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet), two few-shot classification problems, and blind face restoration problem empirically validate the developed theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generalized regularized evidential models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HINTS是一个自监督学习框架，无需外部数据，从时间序列残差中提取潜在人类因素（如社会影响、记忆和偏见），通过FJ意见动力学模型作为结构归纳偏置，提升时间序列预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类决策、情感和集体心理学是影响金融经济系统时间动态的复杂因素。现有方法依赖外部数据（新闻、社交媒体）来捕捉这些因素，但存在高昂的数据依赖成本（财务、计算、实际）。需要一种无需外部数据就能内生提取这些潜在因素的方法。

Method: 提出HINTS自监督学习框架：1) 从时间序列残差中内生提取潜在人类因素；2) 使用Friedkin-Johnsen意见动力学模型作为结构归纳偏置，建模演化中的社会影响、记忆和偏见模式；3) 将提取的人类因素作为注意力图集成到最先进的骨干模型中。

Result: 在9个真实世界和基准数据集上的实验表明，HINTS能持续提升预测准确性。多个案例研究和消融研究验证了HINTS的可解释性，显示提取的因素与现实世界事件有强语义对齐，证明了其实用价值。

Conclusion: HINTS无需外部数据就能有效提取人类因素，通过FJ意见动力学模型提供结构偏置，不仅提升了时间序列预测性能，还提供了可解释的潜在因素，与真实事件有语义对齐，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Human decision-making, emotions, and collective psychology are complex factors that shape the temporal dynamics observed in financial and economic systems. Many recent time series forecasting models leverage external sources (e.g., news and social media) to capture human factors, but these approaches incur high data dependency costs in terms of financial, computational, and practical implications. In this study, we propose HINTS, a self-supervised learning framework that extracts these latent factors endogenously from time series residuals without external data. HINTS leverages the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model as a structural inductive bias to model evolving social influence, memory, and bias patterns. The extracted human factors are integrated into a state-of-the-art backbone model as an attention map. Experimental results using nine real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that HINTS consistently improves forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, multiple case studies and ablation studies validate the interpretability of HINTS, demonstrating strong semantic alignment between the extracted factors and real-world events, demonstrating the practical utility of HINTS.

TL;DR: MUSIC是一个稀疏诱导的多任务神经网络框架，用于在物理约束变量和数据驱动变量互斥的情况下，恢复耦合系统的全维解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂系统通常由多个耦合变量描述，但通常只有一个变量的控制方程已知，其他变量只能通过数据获取。已知物理知识与观测数据之间的不匹配对现有物理信息机器学习方法构成了根本挑战。

Method: MUSIC采用稀疏诱导的多任务神经网络框架，将部分物理约束与数据驱动学习相结合，使用无网格（随机）采样训练数据和稀疏正则化，生成高度压缩的模型。

Result: MUSIC能够准确学习复杂耦合系统在数据稀缺和噪声条件下的解（冲击波解、不连续解、模式形成解），始终优于非稀疏公式。

Conclusion: MUSIC为具有不完全物理知识的部分观测系统建模提供了一种灵活有效的方法。

Abstract: Advances in data acquisition and computational methods have accelerated the use of differential equation based modelling for complex systems. Such systems are often described by coupled (or more) variables, yet governing equation is typically available for one variable, while the remaining variable can be accessed only through data. This mismatch between known physics and observed data poses a fundamental challenge for existing physics-informed machine learning approaches, which generally assume either complete knowledge of the governing equations or full data availability across all variables. In this paper, we introduce MUSIC (Multitask Learning Under Sparse and Incomplete Constraints), a sparsity induced multitask neural network framework that integrates partial physical constraints with data-driven learning to recover full-dimensional solutions of coupled systems when physics-constrained and data-informed variables are mutually exclusive. MUSIC employs mesh-free (random) sampling of training data and sparsity regularization, yielding highly compressed models with improved training and evaluation efficiency. We demonstrate that MUSIC accurately learns solutions (shock wave solutions, discontinuous solutions, pattern formation solutions) to complex coupled systems under data-scarce and noisy conditions, consistently outperforming non-sparse formulations. These results highlight MUSIC as a flexible and effective approach for modeling partially observed systems with incomplete physical knowledge.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) represents an efficient and popular approach for network traffic classification. However, network traffic classification is a challenging domain, and trained models may degrade soon after deployment due to the obsolete datasets and quick evolution of computer networks as new or updated protocols appear. Moreover, significant change in the behavior of a traffic type (and, therefore, the underlying features representing the traffic) can produce a large and sudden performance drop of the deployed model, known as a data or concept drift. In most cases, complete retraining is performed, often without further investigation of root causes, as good dataset quality is assumed. However, this is not always the case and further investigation must be performed. This paper proposes a novel methodology to evaluate the stability of datasets and a benchmark workflow that can be used to compare datasets.
  The proposed framework is based on a concept drift detection method that also uses ML feature weights to boost the detection performance. The benefits of this work are demonstrated on CESNET-TLS-Year22 dataset. We provide the initial dataset stability benchmark that is used to describe dataset stability and weak points to identify the next steps for optimization. Lastly, using the proposed benchmarking methodology, we show the optimization impact on the created dataset variants.

Result: 在指数增长基准测试、MNIST图像采样和稀疏视图X射线CT实验中，NODE均优于基线方法，展示了改进的重建精度和任务特定性能。

Conclusion: NODE通过避免双层优化和间接稀疏正则化，提供了一种更直接、计算效率更高的最优实验设计方法，在多个逆问题应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We introduce Neural Optimal Design of Experiments, a learning-based framework for optimal experimental design in inverse problems that avoids classical bilevel optimization and indirect sparsity regularization. NODE jointly trains a neural reconstruction model and a fixed-budget set of continuous design variables representing sensor locations, sampling times, or measurement angles, within a single optimization loop. By optimizing measurement locations directly rather than weighting a dense grid of candidates, the proposed approach enforces sparsity by design, eliminates the need for l1 tuning, and substantially reduces computational complexity. We validate NODE on an analytically tractable exponential growth benchmark, on MNIST image sampling, and illustrate its effectiveness on a real world sparse view X ray CT example. In all cases, NODE outperforms baseline approaches, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy and task-specific performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流行病学研究中，时间依赖性暴露对生存结果的累积效应建模具有挑战性。传统基于样条的统计方法需要重复数据转换和参数调优，且计算依赖整个数据集，难以处理大规模数据。现有的神经网络生存分析方法注重准确性但缺乏对累积暴露模式的可解释性。

Conclusion: CENNSurv为研究累积效应的研究人员提供了一个实用工具，能够提供可解释的洞察，填补了传统统计方法与神经网络方法在可解释性和可扩展性方面的空白。

Abstract: In epidemiological research, modeling the cumulative effects of time-dependent exposures on survival outcomes presents a challenge due to their intricate temporal dynamics. Conventional spline-based statistical methods, though effective, require repeated data transformation for each spline parameter tuning, with survival analysis computations relying on the entire dataset, posing difficulties for large datasets. Meanwhile, existing neural network-based survival analysis methods focus on accuracy but often overlook the interpretability of cumulative exposure patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce CENNSurv, a novel deep learning approach that captures dynamic risk relationships from time-dependent data. Evaluated on two diverse real-world datasets, CENNSurv revealed a multi-year lagged association between chronic environmental exposure and a critical survival outcome, as well as a critical short-term behavioral shift prior to subscription lapse. This demonstrates CENNSurv's ability to model complex temporal patterns with improved scalability. CENNSurv provides researchers studying cumulative effects a practical tool with interpretable insights.

Motivation: 传统子空间聚类使用几何均值或中位数作为代表点，但子空间数据位于格拉斯曼或旗流形上，需要更合适的几何代表来提升聚类效果

Method: 引入舒伯特簇最佳拟合作为可训练原型，集成到Linde-Buzo-Grey流水线中，形成SVBF-LBG算法

Conclusion: SVBF-LBG算法通过几何优化的原型设计，有效提升了子空间聚类的性能，为后续分析提供了更好的数学基础

Abstract: In many classification and clustering tasks, it is useful to compute a geometric representative for a dataset or a cluster, such as a mean or median. When datasets are represented by subspaces, these representatives become points on the Grassmann or flag manifold, with distances induced by their geometry, often via principal angles. We introduce a subspace clustering algorithm that replaces subspace means with a trainable prototype defined as a Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF) - a subspace that comes as close as possible to intersecting each cluster member in at least one fixed direction. Integrated in the Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) pipeline, this SVBF-LBG scheme yields improved cluster purity on synthetic, image, spectral, and video action data, while retaining the mathematical structure required for downstream analysis.

Conclusion: MERINDA能够将准确、可解释的模型恢复技术带到边缘，实现对自主系统的实时监控，使物理AI在资源受限设备上变得实用。

Abstract: Physical AI at the edge -- enabling autonomous systems to understand and predict real-world dynamics in real time -- requires hardware-efficient learning and inference. Model recovery (MR), which identifies governing equations from sensor data, is a key primitive for safe and explainable monitoring in mission-critical autonomous systems operating under strict latency, compute, and power constraints. However, state-of-the-art MR methods (e.g., EMILY and PINN+SR) rely on Neural ODE formulations that require iterative solvers and are difficult to accelerate efficiently on edge hardware. We present \textbf{MERINDA} (Model Recovery in Reconfigurable Dynamic Architecture), an FPGA-accelerated MR framework designed to make physical AI practical on resource-constrained devices. MERINDA replaces expensive Neural ODE components with a hardware-friendly formulation that combines (i) GRU-based discretized dynamics, (ii) dense inverse-ODE layers, (iii) sparsity-driven dropout, and (iv) lightweight ODE solvers. The resulting computation is structured for streaming parallelism, enabling critical kernels to be fully parallelized on the FPGA. Across four benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems, MERINDA delivers substantial gains over GPU implementations: \textbf{114$\times$ lower energy} (434~J vs.\ 49{,}375~J), \textbf{28$\times$ smaller memory footprint} (214~MB vs.\ 6{,}118~MB), and \textbf{1.68$\times$ faster training}, while matching state-of-the-art model-recovery accuracy. These results demonstrate that MERINDA can bring accurate, explainable MR to the edge for real-time monitoring of autonomous systems.

Conclusion: SB-TRPO为硬约束强化学习提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过理论保证和实验验证，在安全关键领域实现了安全约束与奖励性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical domains requires agents to maximise rewards while strictly adhering to safety constraints. Existing approaches, such as Lagrangian and projection-based methods, often either fail to ensure near-zero safety violations or sacrifice reward performance in the face of hard constraints. We propose Safety-Biased Trust Region Policy Optimisation (SB-TRPO), a new trust-region algorithm for hard-constrained RL. SB-TRPO adaptively biases policy updates towards constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement. Concretely, it performs trust-region updates using a convex combination of the natural policy gradients of cost and reward, ensuring a fixed fraction of optimal cost reduction at each step. We provide a theoretical guarantee of local progress towards safety, with reward improvement when gradients are suitably aligned. Experiments on standard and challenging Safety Gymnasium tasks show that SB-TRPO consistently achieves the best balance of safety and meaningful task completion compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, yet many of its most effective methods rely on access to large amounts of labeled data or extensive online interaction. In practice, acquiring high-quality labels and making decisions through trial-and-error can be expensive, time-consuming, or risky, particularly in large-scale or high-stakes settings. This dissertation studies interactive machine learning, in which the learner actively influences how information is collected or which actions are taken, using past observations to guide future interactions. We develop new algorithmic principles and establish fundamental limits for interactive learning along three dimensions: active learning with noisy data and rich model classes, sequential decision making with large action spaces, and model selection under partial feedback. Our results include the first computationally efficient active learning algorithms achieving exponential label savings without low-noise assumptions; the first efficient, general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms whose guarantees are independent of the size of the action space; and the first tight characterizations of the fundamental cost of model selection in sequential decision making. Overall, this dissertation advances the theoretical foundations of interactive learning by developing algorithms that are statistically optimal and computationally efficient, while also providing principled guidance for deploying interactive learning methods in large-scale, real-world settings.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要针对现货市场，无法直接应用于高杠杆的期货市场，面临两大挑战：1）高杠杆放大奖励波动，导致训练不稳定难以收敛；2）缺乏对能力边界的自我认知，面对新市场状态（如黑天鹅事件）时容易遭受重大损失。

Abstract: Futures are contracts obligating the exchange of an asset at a predetermined date and price, notable for their high leverage and liquidity and, therefore, thrive in the Crypto market. RL has been widely applied in various quantitative tasks. However, most methods focus on the spot and could not be directly applied to the futures market with high leverage because of 2 challenges. First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management. In stage I, ensemble Q learners are selectively updated by ensemble TD errors to improve convergence. In stage II, we filter the Q-learners based on their profitabilities and train VAEs on market states to identify the capability boundaries of the learners. In stage III, we choose from the filtered ensemble and a conservative policy, guided by trained VAEs, to maintain profitability and mitigate risk with new market states. Through extensive experiments on crypto futures in a high-frequency trading environment with high fidelity and 5x leverage, we demonstrate that FineFT outperforms 12 SOTA baselines in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving superior profitability compared to the runner-up. Visualization of the selective update mechanism shows that different agents specialize in distinct market dynamics, and ablation studies certify routing with VAEs reduces maximum drawdown effectively, and selective update improves convergence and performance.

TL;DR: 本文研究了类别不平衡下的多分类问题，提出了两种先进的替代损失函数：广义对数调整损失和广义类别感知加权损失，并进行了全面的理论分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平衡损失函数在类别不平衡的多分类中被广泛采用，它通过平等对待所有类别来促进公平性。然而，直接最小化平衡分类损失通常是难以处理的，因此设计有效的替代损失函数成为一个核心问题。

Method: 提出了两种替代损失函数家族：1）广义对数调整损失，将对数调整损失推广到更广泛的交叉熵损失家族；2）广义类别感知加权损失，扩展了标准的类别加权损失，通过加入类别相关的置信度边界并扩展到一般交叉熵家族。

Result: 理论分析表明：GLA损失是贝叶斯一致的，但仅对完整假设集是H一致的，其H一致性边界与最小类别概率成反比；而GCA损失对任何有界或完整假设集都是H一致的，其边界以1/√p_min的比例缩放，在高度不平衡设置中提供更强的理论保证。实验显示两种损失都显著优于简单类别加权损失和对数调整损失。

Conclusion: GCA损失在高度不平衡设置中具有理论优势，而GLA损失在常见基准测试中表现略好。两种方法都显著改进了现有的类别不平衡处理方法，为不平衡分类提供了更强大的理论保证和实际性能。

Abstract: The balanced loss is a widely adopted objective for multi-class classification under class imbalance. By assigning equal importance to all classes, regardless of their frequency, it promotes fairness and ensures that minority classes are not overlooked. However, directly minimizing the balanced classification loss is typically intractable, which makes the design of effective surrogate losses a central question. This paper introduces and studies two advanced surrogate loss families: Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) loss functions and Generalized Class-Aware weighted (GCA) losses. GLA losses generalize Logit-Adjusted losses, which shift logits based on class priors, to the broader general cross-entropy loss family. GCA loss functions extend the standard class-weighted losses, which scale losses inversely by class frequency, by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins and extending them to the general cross-entropy family. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of consistency for both loss families. We show that GLA losses are Bayes-consistent, but only $H$-consistent for complete (i.e., unbounded) hypothesis sets. Moreover, their $H$-consistency bounds depend inversely on the minimum class probability, scaling at least as $1/\mathsf p_{\min}$. In contrast, GCA losses are $H$-consistent for any hypothesis set that is bounded or complete, with $H$-consistency bounds that scale more favorably as $1/\sqrt{\mathsf p_{\min}}$, offering significantly stronger theoretical guarantees in imbalanced settings. We report the results of experiments demonstrating that, empirically, both the GCA losses with calibrated class-dependent confidence margins and GLA losses can greatly outperform straightforward class-weighted losses as well as the LA losses. GLA generally performs slightly better in common benchmarks, whereas GCA exhibits a slight edge in highly imbalanced settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI正从对话助手转向自主决策系统（代理系统），这种转变产生了自主性悖论：系统被赋予更大操作自主权时，反而需要更正式的结构、更明确的约束和更强的尾部风险控制。随机生成模型在操作领域可能很脆弱，需要可验证的可行性、对分布偏移的鲁棒性以及高后果场景的压力测试机制。

Method: 开发了一个基于运筹学的保证自主性概念框架，包含两个互补方法：1) 基于流的生成模型，将生成视为确定性传输，实现可审计性、约束感知生成，并与最优传输、鲁棒优化和顺序决策控制连接；2) 通过对抗鲁棒性视角制定操作安全性，在不确定性或模糊集内评估决策规则对抗最坏情况扰动的能力。

Result: 该框架阐明了随着自主性增加，运筹学的角色从求解器转变为护栏再到系统架构师，负责控制逻辑、激励协议、监控机制和安全边界的设计。这些要素为安全关键、可靠性敏感的操作领域中的保证自主性定义了研究议程。

Conclusion: 生成式AI向代理系统的转变需要新的保证自主性框架。基于运筹学的方法通过结合基于流的生成模型和对抗鲁棒性，为解决自主性悖论提供了理论基础，为安全关键领域的自主系统设计指明了方向。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is shifting from conversational assistants toward agentic systems -- autonomous decision-making systems that sense, decide, and act within operational workflows. This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries. These elements define a research agenda for assured autonomy in safety-critical, reliability-sensitive operational domains.

Abstract: We present TabMixNN, a flexible PyTorch-based deep learning framework that synthesizes classical mixed-effects modeling with modern neural network architectures for tabular data analysis. TabMixNN addresses the growing need for methods that can handle hierarchical data structures while supporting diverse outcome types including regression, classification, and multitask learning. The framework implements a modular three-stage architecture: (1) a mixed-effects encoder with variational random effects and flexible covariance structures, (2) backbone architectures including Generalized Structural Equation Models (GSEM) and spatial-temporal manifold networks, and (3) outcome-specific prediction heads supporting multiple outcome families. Key innovations include an R-style formula interface for accessibility, support for directed acyclic graph (DAG) constraints for causal structure learning, Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) kernels for spatial modeling, and comprehensive interpretability tools including SHAP values and variance decomposition. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility through applications to longitudinal data analysis, genomic prediction, and spatial-temporal modeling. TabMixNN provides a unified interface for researchers to leverage deep learning while maintaining the interpretability and theoretical grounding of classical mixed-effects models.

<details>

Motivation: 基于学习的模拟器在评估算法、设计选择和干预时，由于随机初始化和学习随机性导致结果方差高，标准独立评估设计未能利用跨替代方案的共享随机源

Method: 形式化配对种子评估设计，让竞争系统在相同随机种子下评估，诱导随机组件的匹配实现，当结果在种子级别正相关时实现严格方差降低

Result: 配对种子评估产生更紧的置信区间、更高的统计功效，在固定计算预算下实现有效样本量增益，种子级相关性通常大且正，产生数量级效率提升

Conclusion: 配对种子评估在实践中是弱占优的，当相关性存在时提高统计可靠性，当不存在时退化为独立评估而不损失有效性

Abstract: Machine learning systems appear stochastic but are deterministically random, as seeded pseudorandom number generators produce identical realisations across executions. Learning-based simulators are widely used to compare algorithms, design choices, and interventions under such dynamics, yet evaluation outcomes often exhibit high variance due to random initialisation and learning stochasticity. We analyse the statistical structure of comparative evaluation in these settings and show that standard independent evaluation designs fail to exploit shared sources of randomness across alternatives. We formalise a paired seed evaluation design in which competing systems are evaluated under identical random seeds, inducing matched realisations of stochastic components and strict variance reduction whenever outcomes are positively correlated at the seed level. This yields tighter confidence intervals, higher statistical power, and effective sample size gains at fixed computational budgets. Empirically, seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, producing order-of-magnitude efficiency gains. Paired seed evaluation is weakly dominant in practice, improving statistical reliability when correlation is present and reducing to independent evaluation without loss of validity when it is not.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网(IIoT)关键基础设施面临严重安全威胁（如2021年Oldsmar水处理厂和2023年丹麦能源部门攻击），现有联邦学习(FL)框架存在拜占庭攻击漏洞且缺乏鲁棒的身份认证机制。

Method: 提出零信任代理联邦学习(ZTA-FL)框架，包含三个核心组件：1) TPM加密认证（误接受率<0.0000001）；2) SHAP加权聚合算法（提供可解释的拜占庭检测，具有理论保证）；3) 隐私保护的设备端对抗训练。

Abstract: Recent attacks on critical infrastructure, including the 2021 Oldsmar water treatment breach and 2023 Danish energy sector compromises, highlight urgent security gaps in Industrial IoT (IIoT) deployments. While Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative intrusion detection, existing frameworks remain vulnerable to Byzantine poisoning attacks and lack robust agent authentication. We propose Zero-Trust Agentic Federated Learning (ZTA-FL), a defense in depth framework combining: (1) TPM-based cryptographic attestation achieving less than 0.0000001 false acceptance rate, (2) a novel SHAP-weighted aggregation algorithm providing explainable Byzantine detection under non-IID conditions with theoretical guarantees, and (3) privacy-preserving on-device adversarial training.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效弥合了弱监督和高维统计之间的差距，为高维Pconf分类提供了有效的稀疏正则化解决方案。

Abstract: High-dimensional learning problems, where the number of features exceeds the sample size, often require sparse regularization for effective prediction and variable selection. While established for fully supervised data, these techniques remain underexplored in weak-supervision settings such as Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification. Pconf learning utilizes only positive samples equipped with confidence scores, thereby avoiding the need for negative data. However, existing Pconf methods are ill-suited for high-dimensional regimes. This paper proposes a novel sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification. We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery. Theoretically, we establish estimation and prediction error bounds for the L1-regularized Pconf estimator, proving it achieves near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates under Restricted Strong Convexity condition. To solve the resulting composite objective, we develop an efficient proximal gradient algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve predictive performance and variable selection accuracy comparable to fully supervised approaches, effectively bridging the gap between weak supervision and high-dimensional statistics.

Motivation: 现有心电图深度学习模型对抗平滑对抗扰动脆弱，传统防御方法面临计算负担重或推理延迟大的困境，需要一种能平衡鲁棒性、效率和临床可解释性的解决方案

Method: 提出因果生理表示学习(CPR)，在因果解缠框架中融入生理结构先验，通过结构因果模型建模心电图生成，强制分离不变病理形态(P-QRS-T复合波)与非因果伪影

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上，CPR显著优于标准临床预处理方法；在SAP攻击下达到0.632的F1分数，比中值平滑(0.541 F1)提升9.1%；匹配随机平滑的认证鲁棒性同时保持单次推理效率

Conclusion: CPR方法在鲁棒性、效率和临床可解释性之间提供了优越的权衡，解决了心电图诊断模型对抗扰动的脆弱性问题，为实时临床监测提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis have achieved remarkable accuracy but exhibit fragility against adversarial perturbations, particularly Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) that mimic biological morphology. Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.

Result: 1) 纯隐私设置中，对数损失配合MLE风格算法达到接近最优速率；2) 联合隐私-腐败设置中，现有离线算法提供比已知更强的保证；3) 首次提出私有鲁棒在线对齐结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为语言模型对齐中的隐私和鲁棒性问题提供了理论框架，提出的统一收敛性保证在学习和统计领域具有广泛适用性，特别是在隐私优先和腐败优先的不同交互模式下。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the private and robust alignment of language models from a theoretical perspective by establishing upper bounds on the suboptimality gap in both offline and online settings. We consider preference labels subject to privacy constraints and/or adversarial corruption, and analyze two distinct interplays between them: privacy-first and corruption-first. For the privacy-only setting, we show that log loss with an MLE-style algorithm achieves near-optimal rates, in contrast to conventional wisdom. For the joint privacy-and-corruption setting, we first demonstrate that existing offline algorithms in fact provide stronger guarantees -- simultaneously in terms of corruption level and privacy parameters -- than previously known, which further yields improved bounds in the corruption-only regime. In addition, we also present the first set of results for private and robust online alignment. Our results are enabled by new uniform convergence guarantees for log loss and square loss under privacy and corruption, which we believe have broad applicability across learning theory and statistics.

TL;DR: 提出MDBF方法改进双二进制分解，通过多包络结构提升低比特量化下LLM的性能，保持部署友好的推理原语


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双二进制分解(DBF)在极端低比特量化中很有吸引力，但其缩放参数限制性太强，所有秩分量共享相同的幅度分布，导致性能饱和

Method: 提出多包络DBF(MDBF)：保留共享的1比特符号基，但用秩-l包络替换单一包络；通过共享符号矩阵，保持二进制载体，将有限内存预算用于幅度表达能力；引入闭式初始化和交替优化方法

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen系列模型上，MDBF在相同比特/权重下比先前二进制格式提升了困惑度和零样本准确率

Conclusion: MDBF通过多包络结构有效解决了DBF的幅度表达限制，在保持部署友好推理原语的同时，显著提升了极端低比特量化下LLM的性能

Abstract: For extreme low-bit quantization of large language models (LLMs), Double Binary Factorization (DBF) is attractive as it enables efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy. However, the scaling parameters of DBF are too restrictive; after factoring out signs, all rank components share the same magnitude profile, resulting in performance saturation. We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. We also introduce a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to optimize MDBF. Across the LLaMA and Qwen families, MDBF enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over previous binary formats at matched bits per weight while preserving the same deployment-friendly inference primitive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统状态空间模型(SSMs)虽然计算效率高，但存在两个主要问题：1) 有效内存有限，需要更大的状态尺寸来改善记忆能力；2) 难以捕捉多尺度依赖关系，而多尺度依赖对于时间序列、图像和自然语言中的复杂结构建模至关重要。

Result: 在Long Range Arena、分层推理、时间序列分类和图像识别等多个基准测试中，MS-SSM持续优于现有的SSM模型。该方法显著提升了序列建模能力，特别是在长距离和分层任务中，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 多分辨率处理在状态空间架构中具有显著优势。MS-SSM通过多尺度表示和动态信息融合，有效解决了传统SSM的内存限制和多尺度依赖捕捉问题，为序列建模提供了更强大的框架。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have recently attention as an efficient alternative to computationally expensive attention-based models for sequence modeling. They rely on linear recurrences to integrate information over time, enabling fast inference, parallelizable training, and control over recurrence stability. However, traditional SSMs often suffer from limited effective memory, requiring larger state sizes for improved recall. Moreover, existing SSMs struggle to capture multi-scale dependencies, which are essential for modeling complex structures in time series, images, and natural language. This paper introduces a multi-scale SSM framework that addresses these limitations by representing sequence dynamics across multiple resolution and processing each resolution with specialized state-space dynamics. By capturing both fine-grained, high-frequency patterns and coarse, global trends, MS-SSM enhances memory efficiency and long-range modeling. We further introduce an input-dependent scale-mixer, enabling dynamic information fusion across resolutions. The proposed approach significantly improves sequence modeling, particularly in long-range and hierarchical tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, including Long Range Arena, hierarchical reasoning, time series classification, and image recognition, demonstrate that MS-SSM consistently outperforms prior SSM-based models, highlighting the benefits of multi-resolution processing in state-space architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式时间序列插补方法（如扩散概率模型和Schrodinger桥模型）使用高斯噪声或线性插值作为先验，这些先验缺乏对真实目标的信息，导致生成过程负担增加且插补精度有限。

Method: 提出Bridge-TS方法：1）专家先验：使用预训练的transformer模块作为专家，对缺失值进行确定性估计，并将结果作为真实目标的先验；2）组合先验：利用多个预训练模型提供不同的估计结果，在数据到数据生成过程中组合它们，实现组合先验到目标的插补过程。

Conclusion: 通过改进先验设计，Bridge-TS证明了在生成式时间序列插补中提升先验信息的重要性，为时间序列插补任务提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series imputation, i.e., filling the missing values of a time recording, finds various applications in electricity, finance, and weather modelling. Previous methods have introduced generative models such as diffusion probabilistic models and Schrodinger bridge models to conditionally generate the missing values from Gaussian noise or directly from linear interpolation results. However, as their prior is not informative to the ground-truth target, their generation process inevitably suffer increased burden and limited imputation accuracy. In this work, we present Bridge-TS, building a data-to-data generation process for generative time series imputation and exploiting the design of prior with two novel designs. Firstly, we propose expert prior, leveraging a pretrained transformer-based module as an expert to fill the missing values with a deterministic estimation, and then taking the results as the prior of ground truth target. Secondly, we explore compositional priors, utilizing several pretrained models to provide different estimation results, and then combining them in the data-to-data generation process to achieve a compositional priors-to-target imputation process. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets such as ETT, Exchange, and Weather show that Bridge-TS reaches a new record of imputation accuracy in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error, demonstrating the superiority of improving prior for generative time series imputation.

Conclusion: Trellis通过有界记忆和动态压缩机制，有效解决了Transformer的计算和内存问题，特别适合长序列处理，为长上下文应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers, while powerful, suffer from quadratic computational complexity and the ever-growing Key-Value (KV) cache of the attention mechanism. This paper introduces Trellis, a novel Transformer architecture with bounded memory that learns how to compress its key-value memory dynamically at test time. Trellis replaces the standard KV cache with a fixed-size memory and train a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism to store new keys and values into memory. To achieve this, it leverages an online gradient descent procedure with a forget gate, enabling the compressed memory to be updated recursively while learning to retain important contextual information from incoming tokens at test time. Extensive experiments on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive tasks, and time series show that the proposed architecture outperforms strong baselines. Notably, its performance gains increase as the sequence length grows, highlighting its potential for long-context applications.

Abstract: Neural processes (NPs) are a class of models that learn stochastic processes directly from data and can be used for inference, sampling and conditional sampling. We introduce a new NP model based on flow matching, a generative modeling paradigm that has demonstrated strong performance on various data modalities. Following the NP training framework, the model provides amortized predictions of conditional distributions over any arbitrary points in the data. Compared to previous NP models, our model is simple to implement and can be used to sample from conditional distributions using an ODE solver, without requiring auxiliary conditioning methods. In addition, the model provides a controllable tradeoff between accuracy and running time via the number of steps in the ODE solver. We show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art neural process methods on various benchmarks including synthetic 1D Gaussian processes data, 2D images, and real-world weather data.

Conclusion: 在小型语言模型中实现稳健的长上下文能力受益于Infini-attention等架构记忆机制，有效补偿了SLMs的有限参数限制

Abstract: This study investigates small-scale pretraining for Small Language Models (SLMs) to enable efficient use of limited data and compute, improve accessibility in low-resource settings and reduce costs. To enhance long-context extrapolation in compact models, we focus on Infini-attention, which builds a compressed memory from past segments while preserving local attention. In our work, we conduct an empirical study using 300M-parameter LLaMA models pretrained with Infini-attention. The model demonstrates training stability and outperforms the baseline in long-context retrieval. We identify the balance factor as a key part of the model performance, and we found that retrieval accuracy drops with repeated memory compressions over long sequences. Even so, Infini-attention still effectively compensates for the SLM's limited parameters. Particularly, despite performance degradation at a 16,384-token context, the Infini-attention model achieves up to 31% higher accuracy than the baseline. Our findings suggest that achieving robust long-context capability in SLMs benefits from architectural memory like Infini-attention.

Abstract: Soft actor-critic (SAC) is a popular algorithm for max-entropy reinforcement learning. In practice, the energy-based policies in SAC are often approximated using simple policy classes for efficiency, sacrificing the expressiveness and robustness. In this paper, we propose a variant of the SAC algorithm that parameterizes the policy with flow-based models, leveraging their rich expressiveness. In the algorithm, we evaluate the flow-based policy utilizing the instantaneous change-of-variable technique and update the policy with an online variant of flow matching developed in this paper. This online variant, termed importance sampling flow matching (ISFM), enables policy update with only samples from a user-specified sampling distribution rather than the unknown target distribution. We develop a theoretical analysis of ISFM, characterizing how different choices of sampling distributions affect the learning efficiency. Finally, we conduct a case study of our algorithm on the max-entropy linear quadratic regulator problems, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm learns the optimal action distribution.

TL;DR: 该研究对10种深度学习架构进行GHI短期预测基准测试，发现Transformer表现最佳，并通过知识蒸馏压缩模型尺寸同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球水平辐照度（GHI）的可靠预测对缓解太阳能波动至关重要，需要评估不同深度学习架构在短期预测中的性能，并探索在资源受限设备上的部署方案。

Method: 使用胡志明市2011-2020年高分辨率NSRDB卫星数据，对比10种深度学习架构（包括LSTM、TCN、Transformer、Informer、iTransformer、TSMixer、Mamba等）进行1小时前GHI预测，采用SHAP分析解释模型决策，并应用知识蒸馏压缩高性能模型。

Result: Transformer架构表现最佳，R²达到0.9696；SHAP分析显示Transformer具有"近期偏向"，而Mamba能利用24小时周期性依赖；知识蒸馏可将Transformer压缩23.5%，同时降低预测误差（MAE：23.78 W/m²）。

Abstract: Reliable forecasting of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is essential for mitigating the variability of solar energy in power grids. This study presents a comprehensive benchmark of ten deep learning architectures for short-term (1-hour ahead) GHI time series forecasting in Ho Chi Minh City, leveraging high-resolution NSRDB satellite data (2011-2020) to compare established baselines (e.g. LSTM, TCN) against emerging state-of-the-art architectures, including Transformer, Informer, iTransformer, TSMixer, and Mamba. Experimental results identify the Transformer as the superior architecture, achieving the highest predictive accuracy with an R^2 of 0.9696. The study further utilizes SHAP analysis to contrast the temporal reasoning of these architectures, revealing that Transformers exhibit a strong "recency bias" focused on immediate atmospheric conditions, whereas Mamba explicitly leverages 24-hour periodic dependencies to inform predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Knowledge Distillation can compress the high-performance Transformer by 23.5% while surprisingly reducing error (MAE: 23.78 W/m^2), offering a proven pathway for deploying sophisticated, low-latency forecasting on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Dense linear layers are a dominant source of computational and parametric cost in modern machine learning models, despite their quadratic complexity and often being misaligned with the compositional structure of learned representations. We introduce Stagewise Pairwise Mixers (SPM), a structured linear operator that replaces dense matrices with a composition of sparse pairwise-mixing stages. An SPM layer implements a global linear transformation in $O(nL)$ time with $O(nL)$ parameters, where $L$ is typically constant or $log_2n$, and admits exact closed-form forward and backward computations. SPM is designed as a drop-in replacement for dense linear layers in feedforward networks, recurrent architectures, attention mechanisms, etc. We derive complete forward and backward expressions for two parameterizations: an orthogonal norm-preserving rotation-based variant and a fully general $2 \times 2$ mixing variant. Beyond computational savings, the stagewise structure of SPM induces an explicit compositional inductive bias that constrains model capacity and improves generalization when aligned with task structure. We present proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating substantial reductions in wall-clock cost and improved accuracy on structured learning problems, while retaining competitive performance on real-world benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出物理约束（如代谢限制）可作为时间归纳偏置促进泛化，通过相空间分析揭示扩张动态放大噪声而适当耗散动态压缩相空间，与网络频谱偏置对齐，强制提取不变特征。这种约束可通过外部输入编码或内在时间动态施加，需要具备时间整合能力的架构。在监督分类、无监督重建和零样本强化学习中，临界"过渡"机制能最大化泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习关注无约束优化，但生物系统在严格代谢约束下运行。作者认为这些物理约束不应被视为限制，而应作为时间归纳偏置来促进泛化。研究动机是探索约束如何塑造动态特性，使其成为促进泛化的计算机制。

Method: 通过信号传播的相空间分析，揭示扩张动态与耗散动态的基本不对称性。提出两种施加约束的途径：1）外部通过输入编码；2）内在通过网络自身的时间动态。需要具备时间整合能力的架构来解码诱导的不变特征。在监督分类、无监督重建和零样本强化学习任务中进行全面评估。

Result: 研究发现临界"过渡"机制能最大化泛化能力。适当耗散动态能压缩相空间，与网络频谱偏置对齐，强制提取不变特征。静态架构无法利用时间结构，而具备时间整合能力的架构在适当约束下能显著提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: 动态约束构成了一类独特的归纳偏置。稳健的AI发展不仅需要扩展规模和消除限制，更需要计算性地掌握自然促进泛化的时间特性。物理约束可作为时间归纳偏置塑造动态特性，从而提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Conventional deep learning prioritizes unconstrained optimization, yet biological systems operate under strict metabolic constraints. We propose that these physical constraints shape dynamics to function not as limitations, but as a temporal inductive bias that breeds generalization. Through a phase-space analysis of signal propagation, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry: expansive dynamics amplify noise, whereas proper dissipative dynamics compress phase space that aligns with the network's spectral bias, compelling the abstraction of invariant features. This condition can be imposed externally via input encoding, or intrinsically through the network's own temporal dynamics. Both pathways require architectures capable of temporal integration and proper constraints to decode induced invariants, whereas static architectures fail to capitalize on temporal structure. Through comprehensive evaluations across supervised classification, unsupervised reconstruction, and zero-shot reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that a critical "transition" regime maximizes generalization capability. These findings establish dynamical constraints as a distinct class of inductive bias, suggesting that robust AI development requires not only scaling and removing limitations, but computationally mastering the temporal characteristics that naturally promote generalization.

Conclusion: DivQAT是首个通过修改量化过程将模型提取防御集成到训练流程的技术，为量化CNN模型提供了有效的知识产权保护方案。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their quantized counterparts are vulnerable to extraction attacks, posing a significant threat of IP theft. Yet, the robustness of quantized models against these attacks is little studied compared to large models. Previous defenses propose to inject calculated noise into the prediction probabilities. However, these defenses are limited since they are not incorporated during the model design and are only added as an afterthought after training. Additionally, most defense techniques are computationally expensive and often have unrealistic assumptions about the victim model that are not feasible in edge device implementations and do not apply to quantized models. In this paper, we propose DivQAT, a novel algorithm to train quantized CNNs based on Quantization Aware Training (QAT) aiming to enhance their robustness against extraction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our technique is the first to modify the quantization process to integrate a model extraction defense into the training process. Through empirical validation on benchmark vision datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique in defending against model extraction attacks without compromising model accuracy. Furthermore, combining our quantization technique with other defense mechanisms improves their effectiveness compared to traditional QAT.

Abstract: Flood models inform strategic disaster management by simulating the spatiotemporal hydrodynamics of flooding. While physics-based numerical flood models are accurate, their substantial computational cost limits their use in operational settings where rapid predictions are essential. Models designed with graph neural networks (GNNs) provide both speed and accuracy while having the ability to process unstructured spatial domains. Given its flexible input and architecture, GNNs can be leveraged alongside physics-informed techniques with ease, significantly improving interpretability. This study introduces a novel flood GNN architecture, DUALFloodGNN, which embeds physical constraints at both global and local scales through explicit loss terms. The model jointly predicts water volume at nodes and flow along edges through a shared message-passing framework. To improve performance for autoregressive inference, model training is conducted with a multi-step loss enhanced with dynamic curriculum learning. Compared with standard GNN architectures and state-of-the-art GNN flood models, DUALFloodGNN achieves substantial improvements in predicting multiple hydrologic variables while maintaining high computational efficiency.

TL;DR: DataFlow是一个用于在无界时间序列数据上构建、测试和部署高性能机器学习系统的计算框架，通过点对点幂等性确保批处理和流处理执行一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据科学工作流假设有限数据集，从批处理原型迁移到流处理生产系统需要大量重新实现，导致因果性违规、批处理边界伪影和实时故障难以复现等问题。

Method: 基于有向无环图（DAG）的统一执行模型，具有点对点幂等性：任何时间t的输出仅依赖于t之前的固定长度上下文窗口。通过自动跟踪所有转换的知识时间来强制执行严格因果性。

Result: 框架确保批处理模式下开发的模型在流处理生产中无需代码更改即可相同执行，支持跨时间维度和特征维度的灵活分块，原生集成Python数据科学栈，提供在线学习的fit/predict语义、缓存和增量计算以及基于DAG的自动并行化。

Conclusion: DataFlow解决了批处理到流处理迁移的挑战，在金融交易、物联网、欺诈检测和实时分析等多个领域证明了其有效性，通过统一的执行模型确保了因果性、可复现性和部署一致性。

Abstract: We present DataFlow, a computational framework for building, testing, and deploying high-performance machine learning systems on unbounded time-series data. Traditional data science workflows assume finite datasets and require substantial reimplementation when moving from batch prototypes to streaming production systems. This gap introduces causality violations, batch boundary artifacts, and poor reproducibility of real-time failures.
  DataFlow resolves these issues through a unified execution model based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with point-in-time idempotency: outputs at any time t depend only on a fixed-length context window preceding t. This guarantee ensures that models developed in batch mode execute identically in streaming production without code changes. The framework enforces strict causality by automatically tracking knowledge time across all transformations, eliminating future-peeking bugs.
  DataFlow supports flexible tiling across temporal and feature dimensions, allowing the same model to operate at different frequencies and memory profiles via configuration alone. It integrates natively with the Python data science stack and provides fit/predict semantics for online learning, caching and incremental computation, and automatic parallelization through DAG-based scheduling. We demonstrate its effectiveness across domains including financial trading, IoT, fraud detection, and real-time analytics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论的嵌入质量评估指标ERPM，通过邻域矩阵奇异值谱的香农熵和稳定秩来量化信息损失，补充现有基于距离和几何的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入评估指标（如应力、基于排名的邻域准则、局部Procrustes）主要关注距离或局部几何的失真，但未能直接评估高维数据投影到低维空间时信息保留的程度。需要从信息论角度直接量化信息损失。

Method: 引入熵秩保持度量（ERPM），基于邻域矩阵奇异值谱的香农熵和稳定秩，量化原始表示与降维投影之间的不确定性变化。使用金融时间序列和文献中常见的流形数据集进行验证，与基于距离的MRRE和基于几何的Local Procrustes进行比较。

Result: 基于距离的准则与几何和谱度量相关性很低，而ERPM与Local Procrustes显示出强平均相关性，但在局部区域存在显著差异。ERPM能够识别信息损失严重的邻域，补充现有指标。

Conclusion: ERPM从信息论角度补充了现有的嵌入评估指标，特别适用于信息敏感的应用（如早期预警指标构建），能够更全面地评估嵌入质量，识别信息损失严重的区域。

Abstract: In this work we study the quality of low-dimensional embeddings from an explicitly information-theoretic perspective. We begin by noting that classical evaluation metrics such as stress, rank-based neighborhood criteria, or Local Procrustes quantify distortions in distances or in local geometries, but do not directly assess how much information is preserved when projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. To address this limitation, we introduce the Entropy Rank Preservation Measure (ERPM), a local metric based on the Shannon entropy of the singular-value spectrum of neighborhood matrices and on the stable rank, which quantifies changes in uncertainty between the original representation and its reduced projection, providing neighborhood-level indicators and a global summary statistic. To validate the results of the metric, we compare its outcomes with the Mean Relative Rank Error (MRRE), which is distance-based, and with Local Procrustes, which is based on geometric properties, using a financial time series and a manifold commonly studied in the literature. We observe that distance-based criteria exhibit very low correlation with geometric and spectral measures, while ERPM and Local Procrustes show strong average correlation but display significant discrepancies in local regimes, leading to the conclusion that ERPM complements existing metrics by identifying neighborhoods with severe information loss, thereby enabling a more comprehensive assessment of embeddings, particularly in information-sensitive applications such as the construction of early-warning indicators.

TL;DR: CLEAR-HUG是一个两阶段ECG自监督学习框架，通过捕捉心脏传导的细微变化并遵循ECG诊断指南，在六个任务上实现了6.84%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ECG自监督学习方法主要关注导联和心跳间的一致性模式，忽略了心脏传导过程中固有的心跳差异，而这些细微变化携带独特的生理特征。同时，ECG表示学习应该遵循从单个心跳到单导联再到导联组合的临床诊断流程，但现有方法在应用到下游任务时往往忽视这一顺序逻辑。

Method: 提出两阶段框架CLEAR-HUG：第一阶段是自监督学习模型CLEAR（Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor），通过稀疏注意力机制将每个心跳视为独立实体进行信号重建，捕捉心跳间的特定变化和一般共性；第二阶段是用于疾病诊断的层次化导联统一分组头HUG（Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head），模拟临床工作流程。

Result: 在六个任务上的实验结果显示，CLEAR-HUG实现了6.84%的性能提升，验证了该框架在增强心脏传导表示和使模式与专家诊断指南对齐方面的有效性。

Conclusion: CLEAR-HUG通过捕捉心脏传导的细微变化并遵循ECG诊断指南，显著提升了ECG表示学习的性能，证明了将生理知识和临床工作流程融入自监督学习框架的重要性。

Abstract: The multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) stands as a cornerstone of cardiac diagnosis. Recent strides in electrocardiogram self-supervised learning (eSSL) have brightened prospects for enhancing representation learning without relying on high-quality annotations. Yet earlier eSSL methods suffer a key limitation: they focus on consistent patterns across leads and beats, overlooking the inherent differences in heartbeats rooted in cardiac conduction processes, while subtle but significant variations carry unique physiological signatures. Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations. This sequential logic, however, is often neglected when applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks. To address these gaps, we propose CLEAR-HUG, a two-stage framework designed to capture subtle variations in cardiac conduction across leads while adhering to ECG diagnostic guidelines. In the first stage, we introduce an eSSL model termed Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor (CLEAR), which captures both specific variations and general commonalities across heartbeats. Treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity, CLEAR employs a simple yet effective sparse attention mechanism to reconstruct signals without interference from other heartbeats. In the second stage, we implement a Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head (HUG) for disease diagnosis, mirroring clinical workflow. Experimental results across six tasks show a 6.84% improvement, validating the effectiveness of CLEAR-HUG. This highlights its ability to enhance representations of cardiac conduction and align patterns with expert diagnostic guidelines.

Result: 在节点分类、节点聚类和链接预测任务上，HyperGRL相比现有最强方法分别平均提升1.49%、0.86%和0.74%，表现出优越的表示质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于几何基础的无采样对比目标在图表示学习中具有显著有效性，HyperGRL框架通过自适应平衡机制实现了稳定训练和优越性能。

Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) aims to encode structural and semantic dependencies of graph-structured data into low-dimensional embeddings. However, existing GRL methods often rely on surrogate contrastive objectives or mutual information maximization, which typically demand complex architectures, negative sampling strategies, and sensitive hyperparameter tuning. These design choices may induce over-smoothing, over-squashing, and training instability. In this work, we propose HyperGRL, a unified framework for hyperspherical graph representation learning via adaptive neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. HyperGRL embeds nodes on a unit hypersphere through two adversarially coupled objectives: neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. The alignment objective uses the mean representation of each node's local neighborhood to construct semantically grounded, stable targets that capture shared structural and feature patterns. The uniformity objective formulates dispersion via an L2-based hyperspherical regularization, encouraging globally uniform embedding distributions while preserving discriminative information. To further stabilize training, we introduce an entropy-guided adaptive balancing mechanism that dynamically regulates the interplay between alignment and uniformity without requiring manual tuning. Extensive experiments on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction demonstrate that HyperGRL delivers superior representation quality and generalization across diverse graph structures, achieving average improvements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74% over the strongest existing methods, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness of geometrically grounded, sampling-free contrastive objectives for graph representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)调优后表现出截然不同的泛化行为：SFT常导致能力变窄，而RL倾向于保持能力。现有研究依赖粗粒度准确率指标，无法解释这种差异的根本原因。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解LLM中推理的本质提供了新见解，并为设计促进广泛、稳健泛化的训练策略指明了方向。RL调优在保持推理能力方面优于SFT。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display strikingly different generalization behaviors: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often narrows capability, whereas reinforcement-learning (RL) tuning tends to preserve it. The reasons behind this divergence remain unclear, as prior studies have largely relied on coarse accuracy metrics. We address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark that decomposes reasoning into atomic core skills such as calculation, fact retrieval, simulation, enumeration, and diagnostic, providing a concrete framework for addressing the fundamental question of what constitutes reasoning in LLMs. By isolating and measuring these core skills, the benchmark offers a more granular view of how specific cognitive abilities emerge, transfer, and sometimes collapse during post-training. Combined with analyses of low-level statistical patterns such as distributional divergence and parameter statistics, it enables a fine-grained study of how generalization evolves under SFT and RL across mathematical, scientific reasoning, and non-reasoning tasks. Our meta-probing framework tracks model behavior at different training stages and reveals that RL-tuned models maintain more stable behavioral profiles and resist collapse in reasoning skills, whereas SFT models exhibit sharper drift and overfit to surface patterns. This work provides new insights into the nature of reasoning in LLMs and points toward principles for designing training strategies that foster broad, robust generalization.

Abstract: We consider the design of mixing matrices to minimize the operation cost for decentralized federated learning (DFL) in wireless networks, with focus on minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption. As a critical hyperparameter for DFL, the mixing matrix controls both the convergence rate and the needs of agent-to-agent communications, and has thus been studied extensively. However, existing designs mostly focused on minimizing the communication time, leaving open the minimization of per-node energy consumption that is critical for energy-constrained devices. This work addresses this gap through a theoretically-justified solution for mixing matrix design that aims at minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption until convergence, while taking into account the broadcast nature of wireless communications. Based on a novel convergence theorem that allows arbitrarily time-varying mixing matrices, we propose a multi-phase design framework that activates time-varying communication topologies under optimized budgets to trade off the per-iteration energy consumption and the convergence rate while balancing the energy consumption across nodes. Our evaluations based on real data have validated the efficacy of the proposed solution in combining the low energy consumption of sparse mixing matrices and the fast convergence of dense mixing matrices.

Abstract: Lane-change intention prediction is safety-critical for autonomous driving and ADAS, but remains difficult in naturalistic traffic due to noisy kinematics, severe class imbalance, and limited generalization across heterogeneous highway scenarios. We propose Temporal Physics-Informed AI (TPI-AI), a hybrid framework that fuses deep temporal representations with physics-inspired interaction cues. A two-layer bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) encoder learns compact embeddings from multi-step trajectory histories; we concatenate these embeddings with kinematics-, safety-, and interaction-aware features (e.g., headway, TTC, and safe-gap indicators) and train a LightGBM classifier for three-class intention recognition (No-LC, Left-LC, Right-LC). To improve minority-class reliability, we apply imbalance-aware optimization including resampling/weighting and fold-wise threshold calibration. Experiments on two large-scale drone-based datasets, highD (straight highways) and exiD (ramp-rich environments), use location-based splits and evaluate prediction horizons T = 1, 2, 3 s. TPI-AI outperforms standalone LightGBM and Bi-LSTM baselines, achieving macro-F1 of 0.9562, 0.9124, 0.8345 on highD and 0.9247, 0.8197, 0.7605 on exiD at T = 1, 2, 3 s, respectively. These results show that combining physics-informed interaction features with learned temporal embeddings yields robust multi-scenario lane-change intention prediction.

TL;DR: 对GP-VAE模型中潜在自回归作用的消融分析，发现潜在自回归能产生更符合高斯过程先验的轨迹和更好的长期稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型在token层面进行自回归分解，而作者先前工作将序列结构转移到潜在空间。本文旨在系统分析潜在自回归在GP-VAE模型中的具体作用。

Method: 进行系统消融研究，比较三种模型：(1)具有自回归潜在动态的完整GP-VAE模型；(2)潜在变量独立的非自回归消融模型；(3)标准token级自回归Transformer。

Result: 在中等规模语料库和短训练上下文的设定下，潜在自回归能产生更符合高斯过程先验的潜在轨迹，并表现出更好的长期稳定性。移除自回归会导致潜在结构退化和不稳定的长期行为。

Conclusion: 潜在自回归是组织长期结构的有效机制，与token级自回归建模互补。本文是表征结构的实证分析，而非新架构提案。

Abstract: This paper provides an ablation-based analysis of latent autoregression in GP-VAE models, building upon our previous work introducing the architecture. Language models typically rely on an autoregressive factorization over tokens. In contrast, our prior work proposed shifting sequential structure to the latent space through a causal Gaussian process, while using a non-autoregressive decoder. Here, we conduct a systematic ablation study of the role played by latent autoregression. We compare (i) a full GP-VAE model with autoregressive latent dynamics, (ii) a non-autoregressive ablation in which latent variables are independent, and (iii) a standard token-level autoregressive Transformer. Our results show that, within the considered regime (medium-scale corpora and short training contexts), latent autoregression induces latent trajectories that are significantly more compatible with the Gaussian-process prior and exhibit greater long-horizon stability. In contrast, removing autoregression leads to degraded latent structure and unstable long-range behavior. These findings highlight the role of latent autoregression as an effective mechanism for organizing long-range structure, while remaining complementary to token-level autoregressive modeling. They should be interpreted as an empirical analysis of representational structure rather than as a proposal for a new architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管先前研究对LLM自我批判方法的有效性表示怀疑，但本文旨在证明LLM通过内在自我批判（无需外部验证器）能够显著提升规划任务的性能。

Method: 采用few-shot学习技术并逐步扩展到many-shot方法作为基础，在此基础上通过迭代修正和精炼过程实现改进。使用内在自我批判机制，让LLM批判自己的答案。

Result: 在Blocksworld、Logistics和Mini-grid数据集上取得了显著性能提升，超过了强基线准确率，在2024年10月的LLM检查点中创造了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 自我批判能显著提升LLM的规划性能，该方法具有内在自我改进能力，不依赖于特定模型版本，应用于更复杂的搜索技术和更强大的模型将带来更好性能。

Abstract: We demonstrate an approach for LLMs to critique their \emph{own} answers with the goal of enhancing their performance that leads to significant improvements over established planning benchmarks. Despite the findings of earlier research that has cast doubt on the effectiveness of LLMs leveraging self critique methods, we show significant performance gains on planning datasets in the Blocksworld domain through intrinsic self-critique, without external source such as a verifier. We also demonstrate similar improvements on Logistics and Mini-grid datasets, exceeding strong baseline accuracies. We employ a few-shot learning technique and progressively extend it to a many-shot approach as our base method and demonstrate that it is possible to gain substantial improvement on top of this already competitive approach by employing an iterative process for correction and refinement. We illustrate how self-critique can significantly boost planning performance. Our empirical results present new state-of-the-art on the class of models considered, namely LLM model checkpoints from October 2024. Our primary focus lies on the method itself, demonstrating intrinsic self-improvement capabilities that are applicable regardless of the specific model version, and we believe that applying our method to more complex search techniques and more capable models will lead to even better performance.

TL;DR: 提出OptRot和OptRot⁺两种旋转方法，通过最小化权重量化误差来减少LLM中的异常值，在W4A8设置中表现优于现有方法，但在W4A4设置中存在权重与激活量化之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的权重和激活中存在异常值，这使得量化变得困难。现有的旋转方法（如Hadamard旋转）效果有限，需要更有效的方法来减少异常值并提高量化性能。

Method: 提出两种方法：1) OptRot：通过最小化旋转后权重的元素四次方来减少权重异常值；2) OptRot⁺：数据依赖方法，结合激活协方差信息进一步优化性能。主要基于GPTQ量化方法。

Result: 在W4A8设置中，OptRot在权重量化方面优于Hadamard旋转以及更昂贵的SpinQuant和OSTQuant方法，同时改善了激活量化。OptRot⁺进一步提升了性能。但在W4A4设置中，两种方法表现较差，揭示了权重与激活量化之间的权衡。

Conclusion: OptRot和OptRot⁺是有效的旋转方法，能够减少LLM量化中的异常值问题。OptRot通过简单的目标函数实现良好性能，而OptRot⁺通过数据依赖优化进一步提升。但在极端量化设置（W4A4）中存在局限性，需要权衡权重和激活量化。

Abstract: The presence of outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) weights and activations makes them difficult to quantize. Recent work has leveraged rotations to mitigate these outliers. In this work, we propose methods that learn fusible rotations by minimizing principled and cheap proxy objectives to the weight quantization error. We primarily focus on GPTQ as the quantization method. Our main method is OptRot, which reduces weight outliers simply by minimizing the element-wise fourth power of the rotated weights. We show that OptRot outperforms both Hadamard rotations and more expensive, data-dependent methods like SpinQuant and OSTQuant for weight quantization. It also improves activation quantization in the W4A8 setting. We also propose a data-dependent method, OptRot$^{+}$, that further improves performance by incorporating information on the activation covariance. In the W4A4 setting, we see that both OptRot and OptRot$^{+}$ perform worse, highlighting a trade-off between weight and activation quantization.

TL;DR: GARDO框架通过选择性正则化、自适应参考模型更新和多样性奖励增强，解决扩散模型在线强化学习中的奖励破解、探索不足和模式崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于在线强化学习的扩散模型微调方法存在三个核心问题：1）代理奖励与真实目标不匹配导致奖励破解；2）传统正则化方法使用次优参考策略，限制了样本效率和探索能力；3）模式崩溃导致生成多样性下降。

Method: 提出GARDO框架：1）选择性正则化：仅对高不确定性样本应用正则化惩罚；2）自适应参考模型更新：定期更新参考模型以匹配在线策略能力；3）多样性感知优化：对高质量且高多样性的样本增强奖励。

Result: 在多种代理奖励和未见指标上的实验表明，GARDO能有效缓解奖励破解，增强生成多样性，同时不牺牲样本效率或探索能力。

Conclusion: GARDO通过创新的选择性正则化、自适应参考更新和多样性奖励机制，为扩散模型在线强化学习提供了平衡样本效率、探索能力和多样性保持的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics consistently show that GARDO mitigates reward hacking and enhances generation diversity without sacrificing sample efficiency or exploration, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接最小化条件覆盖的均方误差，显著改进了共形预测的条件覆盖性能，为量化回归提供了理论保证的优化框架

Abstract: While conformal prediction provides robust marginal coverage guarantees, achieving reliable conditional coverage for specific inputs remains challenging. Although exact distribution-free conditional coverage is impossible with finite samples, recent work has focused on improving the conditional coverage of standard conformal procedures. Distinct from approaches that target relaxed notions of conditional coverage, we directly minimize the mean squared error of conditional coverage by refining the quantile regression components that underpin many conformal methods. Leveraging a Taylor expansion, we derive a sharp surrogate objective for quantile regression: a density-weighted pinball loss, where the weights are given by the conditional density of the conformity score evaluated at the true quantile. We propose a three-headed quantile network that estimates these weights via finite differences using auxiliary quantile levels at \(1-α\pm δ\), subsequently fine-tuning the central quantile by optimizing the weighted loss. We provide a theoretical analysis with exact non-asymptotic guarantees characterizing the resulting excess risk. Extensive experiments on diverse high-dimensional real-world datasets demonstrate remarkable improvements in conditional coverage performance.

Abstract: Plasma kinetic equations exhibit pronounced sensitivity to microscopic perturbations in model parameters and data, making reliable and efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) essential for predictive simulations. However, the cost of uncertainty sampling, the high-dimensional phase space, and multiscale stiffness pose severe challenges to both computational efficiency and error control in traditional numerical methods. These aspects are further emphasized in presence of collisions where the high-dimensional nonlocal collision integrations and conservation properties pose severe constraints. To overcome this, we present a variance-reduced Monte Carlo framework for UQ in the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau (VPL) system, in which neural network surrogates replace the multiple costly evaluations of the Landau collision term. The method couples a high-fidelity, asymptotic-preserving VPL solver with inexpensive, strongly correlated surrogates based on the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck (VPFP) and Euler--Poisson (EP) equations. For the surrogate models, we introduce a generalization of the separable physics-informed neural network (SPINN), developing a class of tensor neural networks based on an anisotropic micro-macro decomposition, to reduce velocity-moment costs, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. To further increase correlation with VPL, we calibrate the VPFP model and design an asymptotic-preserving SPINN whose small- and large-Knudsen limits recover the EP and VP systems, respectively. Numerical experiments show substantial variance reduction over standard Monte Carlo, accurate statistics with far fewer high-fidelity samples, and lower wall-clock time, while maintaining robustness to stochastic dimension.

Abstract: Sepsis, characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, results in significant mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs. The timely prediction of sepsis progression is crucial for reducing adverse outcomes through early intervention. Despite the development of numerous models for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, there remains a notable gap in approaches for the early detection of sepsis in non-ward settings. This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning algorithms designed for predicting the onset of sepsis on wearable devices by analyzing heart rate data. The architecture of these models was refined through a genetic algorithm, optimizing for performance, computational complexity, and memory requirements. Performance metrics were subsequently extracted for each model to evaluate their feasibility for implementation on wearable devices capable of accurate heart rate monitoring. The models were initially tailored for a prediction window of one hour, later extended to four hours through transfer learning. The encouraging outcomes of this study suggest the potential for wearable technology to facilitate early sepsis detection outside ICU and ward environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出SaM2B框架，通过可靠性感知动态加权和跨模态对比学习，解决无人机通信中多模态波束预测的模态可靠性波动和模态失配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空经济快速发展，无人机通信需要快速准确的波束预测。现有多模态方法使用固定或经验权重，假设各模态始终同等可靠，但实际上不同模态的重要性随无人机运动场景剧烈波动，静态加权会放大退化模态的负面影响，且模态失配和弱对齐会削弱跨场景泛化能力。

Method: 提出语义感知多模态波束预测框架SaM2B：1) 利用环境视觉、飞行姿态和地理空间数据等轻量线索，通过可靠性感知动态权重更新，在不同时间点自适应分配各模态贡献；2) 使用跨模态对比学习，将与特定波束信息相关的"多源表示-波束语义"对齐到共享语义空间，增强模态噪声和分布偏移下的判别能力和鲁棒性。

Result: 在真实世界低空无人机数据集上的实验表明，SaM2B相比基线方法取得了更满意的结果。

Conclusion: SaM2B通过动态权重调整和语义对齐，有效解决了多模态波束预测中的模态可靠性波动问题，提升了无人机通信波束预测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is rapidly expanding driven by urban air mobility, logistics drones, and aerial sensing, while fast and accurate beam prediction in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) communications is crucial for achieving reliable connectivity. Current research is shifting from single-signal to multi-modal collaborative approaches. However, existing multi-modal methods mostly employ fixed or empirical weights, assuming equal reliability across modalities at any given moment. Indeed, the importance of different modalities fluctuates dramatically with UAV motion scenarios, and static weighting amplifies the negative impact of degraded modalities. Furthermore, modal mismatch and weak alignment further undermine cross-scenario generalization. To this end, we propose a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme applied to a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework, named SaM2B. Specifically, SaM2B leverages lightweight cues such as environmental visual, flight posture, and geospatial data to adaptively allocate contributions across modalities at different time points through reliability-aware dynamic weight updates. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal contrastive learning, we align the "multi-source representation beam semantics" associated with specific beam information to a shared semantic space, thereby enhancing discriminative power and robustness under modal noise and distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world low-altitude UAV datasets show that SaM2B achieves more satisfactory results than baseline methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的拉普拉斯近似在欧几里得空间中难以处理现代深度模型的高度各向异性、弯曲的损失曲面和大对称群问题，需要更适应这种结构的几何方法。

Conclusion: TRL有效地弥合了单模型效率和集成级可靠性之间的差距，是一种可扩展的重新参数化高斯近似方法，利用隐式曲率估计在高维参数空间中运行。

Abstract: Laplace approximations are among the simplest and most practical methods for approximate Bayesian inference in neural networks, yet their Euclidean formulation struggles with the highly anisotropic, curved loss surfaces and large symmetry groups that characterize modern deep models. Recent work has proposed Riemannian and geometric Gaussian approximations to adapt to this structure. Building on these ideas, we introduce the Tubular Riemannian Laplace (TRL) approximation. TRL explicitly models the posterior as a probabilistic tube that follows a low-loss valley induced by functional symmetries, using a Fisher/Gauss-Newton metric to separate prior-dominated tangential uncertainty from data-dominated transverse uncertainty. We interpret TRL as a scalable reparametrised Gaussian approximation that utilizes implicit curvature estimates to operate in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our empirical evaluation on ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) demonstrates that TRL achieves excellent calibration, matching or exceeding the reliability of Deep Ensembles (in terms of ECE) while requiring only a fraction (1/5) of the training cost. TRL effectively bridges the gap between single-model efficiency and ensemble-grade reliability.

Abstract: Multimodal intelligence development recently show strong progress in visual understanding and high level reasoning. Though, most reasoning system still reply on textual information as the main medium for inference. This limit their effectiveness in spatial tasks such as visual navigation and geo-localization. This work discuss about the potential scope of this field and eventually propose an idea visual reasoning paradigm Geo-Consistent Visual Planning, our introduced framework called Visual Reasoning for Localization, or ViReLoc, which performs planning and localization using only visual representations. The proposed framework learns spatial dependencies and geometric relations that text based reasoning often suffer to understand. By encoding step by step inference in the visual domain and optimizing with reinforcement based objectives, ViReLoc plans routes between two given ground images. The system also integrates contrastive learning and adaptive feature interaction to align cross view perspectives and reduce viewpoint differences. Experiments across diverse navigation and localization scenarios show consistent improvements in spatial reasoning accuracy and cross view retrieval performance. These results establish visual reasoning as a strong complementary approach for navigation and localization, and show that such tasks can be performed without real time global positioning system data, leading to more secure navigation solutions.

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and dynamic discrete choice (DDC) models explain sequential decision-making by recovering reward functions that rationalize observed behavior. Flexible IRL methods typically rely on machine learning but provide no guarantees for valid inference, while classical DDC approaches impose restrictive parametric specifications and often require repeated dynamic programming. We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself. We then formalize these targets, including policy values under known and counterfactual softmax policies and functionals of the normalized reward, as smooth functionals of the behavior policy and transition kernel, establish pathwise differentiability, and derive their efficient influence functions. Building on this characterization, we construct automatic debiased machine-learning estimators that allow flexible nonparametric estimation of nuisance components while achieving $\sqrt{n}$-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency. Our framework extends classical inference for DDC models to nonparametric rewards and modern machine-learning tools, providing a unified and computationally tractable approach to statistical inference in IRL.

Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems exhibit strong sensitivity to initial conditions and often contain unresolved multiscale processes, making deterministic forecasting fundamentally limited. Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data remains fundamentally limited by identifiability constraints. Recent work has explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as sources of prior causal knowledge, but existing approaches rely on heuristic integration that lacks theoretical grounding. We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (<10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

TL;DR: 研究发现小规模代理模型实验中固定训练配置的评估协议存在问题，提出使用降低学习率的方法来改进数据配方评估的可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI公司依赖小规模代理模型实验来评估数据配方，但社区对实验结论能否可靠迁移到全规模训练的理解有限。标准实验协议中使用固定训练配置进行"公平"比较存在根本问题，因为最优训练配置本质上是数据依赖的。

Method: 提出对评估协议的简单修正：在代理模型训练中使用降低的学习率。理论上证明对于随机特征模型，这种方法能保持数据集按其最优可达损失的排序。实证上在23个数据配方上验证该方法，涵盖数据整理的四个关键维度。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用降低学习率的方法能显著提高小规模实验的可靠性，其相对性能与完全调优的大规模LLM预训练运行有强相关性。数据质量结论会随训练超参数的微小调整而翻转。

Conclusion: 数据配方评估的目标应是识别在数据特定调优下表现最佳的配方。提出的降低学习率方法能有效缓解超参数调优的高成本，为小规模代理模型实验提供更可靠的评估协议。

Abstract: Data teams at frontier AI companies routinely train small proxy models to make critical decisions about pretraining data recipes for full-scale training runs. However, the community has a limited understanding of whether and when conclusions drawn from small-scale experiments reliably transfer to full-scale model training. In this work, we uncover a subtle yet critical issue in the standard experimental protocol for data recipe assessment: the use of identical small-scale model training configurations across all data recipes in the name of "fair" comparison. We show that the experiment conclusions about data quality can flip with even minor adjustments to training hyperparameters, as the optimal training configuration is inherently data-dependent. Moreover, this fixed-configuration protocol diverges from full-scale model development pipelines, where hyperparameter optimization is a standard step. Consequently, we posit that the objective of data recipe assessment should be to identify the recipe that yields the best performance under data-specific tuning. To mitigate the high cost of hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a simple patch to the evaluation protocol: using reduced learning rates for proxy model training. We show that this approach yields relative performance that strongly correlates with that of fully tuned large-scale LLM pretraining runs. Theoretically, we prove that for random-feature models, this approach preserves the ordering of datasets according to their optimal achievable loss. Empirically, we validate this approach across 23 data recipes covering four critical dimensions of data curation, demonstrating dramatic improvements in the reliability of small-scale experiments.

TL;DR: 将E-prop框架扩展到深度网络，提出一种同时处理时间和深度信用分配的在线学习算法，无需通过时间的反向传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线学习方法（如RTRL和E-prop）主要研究单层循环网络，但大脑学习涉及多层结构和深度层次动态，需要同时处理时间和深度的信用分配。

Method: 扩展E-prop框架到任意深度网络，推导出跨深度的递归关系，将E-prop的资格迹扩展到更深层，实现同时跨时间和深度的在线信用分配。

Result: 提出了一种在线学习算法，能够同时准确分配时间和深度信用，无需通过时间的反向传播即可训练深度循环网络。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了在线学习算法可以同时处理时间和深度的信用分配，为训练深度循环网络提供了无需BPTT的可行方案。

Abstract: Recurrent networks are typically trained with backpropagation through time (BPTT). However, BPTT requires storing the history of all states in the network and then replaying them sequentially backwards in time. This computation appears extremely implausible for the brain to implement. Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) proposes an mathematically equivalent alternative where gradient information is propagated forwards in time locally alongside the regular forward pass, however it has significantly greater computational complexity than BPTT which renders it impractical for large networks. E-prop proposes an approximation of RTRL which reduces its complexity to the level of BPTT while maintaining a purely online forward update which can be implemented by an eligibility trace at each synapse. However, works on RTRL and E-prop ubiquitously investigate learning in a single layer with recurrent dynamics. However, learning in the brain spans multiple layers and consists of both hierarchal dynamics in depth as well as time. In this mathematical note, we extend the E-prop framework to handle arbitrarily deep networks, deriving a novel recursion relationship across depth which extends the eligibility traces of E-prop to deeper layers. Our results thus demonstrate an online learning algorithm can perform accurate credit assignment across both time and depth simultaneously, allowing the training of deep recurrent networks without backpropagation through time.

TL;DR: HUMOR框架通过分层推理和群体偏好对齐，提升视觉语言模型生成幽默梗图的能力，实现更好的推理多样性和人类偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成幽默梗图是一个复杂的多模态任务，需要超越直接的图像-标题监督，涉及对视觉内容、上下文线索和主观幽默的细致推理。现有方法在视觉感知和幽默笑点创作之间存在差距。

Method: 提出HUMOR框架：1) 采用分层多路径思维链：先识别模板级意图，在不同上下文下探索多样推理路径，最后锚定高质量上下文特定路径；2) 训练基于相同模板的梗图群体内的成对奖励模型，通过群体强化学习优化，确保信任区域内单调改进的理论保证。

Result: 大量实验表明，HUMOR赋能多种视觉语言模型，实现更优的推理多样性、更可靠的偏好对齐和更高的整体梗图质量。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了一个通用的开放式、人类对齐的多模态生成训练范式，通过连贯输出群体内的比较判断来指导成功，不仅适用于梗图生成，还可推广到其他多模态生成任务。

Abstract: Generating humorous memes is a challenging multimodal task that moves beyond direct image-to-caption supervision. It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels. The reward model then enables a group-wise reinforcement learning optimization, guaranteeing providing a theoretical guarantee for monotonic improvement within the trust region. Extensive experiments show that HUMOR empowers various VLMs with superior reasoning diversity, more reliable preference alignment, and higher overall meme quality. Beyond memes, our work presents a general training paradigm for open-ended, human-aligned multimodal generation, where success is guided by comparative judgment within coherent output group.

TL;DR: DLCM提出了一种分层语言建模框架，通过将计算从token转移到压缩的概念空间来提高效率，实现了在相同推理计算量下性能提升2.69%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对所有token采用统一计算，但语言信息密度高度不均匀。这种token-uniform机制浪费计算资源在可预测的片段上，而对语义关键转换分配不足。

Method: 提出动态大概念模型(DLCM)：1)从潜在表示学习语义边界；2)将计算从token转移到压缩的概念空间；3)端到端发现变长概念；4)引入压缩感知缩放定律；5)开发解耦μP参数化实现稳定训练。

Result: 在压缩比R=4（平均4个token对应一个概念）的设置下，DLCM将约三分之一的推理计算重新分配到更高容量的推理骨干网络中，在12个零样本基准测试中平均提升2.69%（推理FLOPs相同）。

Conclusion: DLCM通过分层压缩改变了缩放行为，实现了更高效的计算分配。压缩感知缩放定律为固定FLOPs下的计算分配提供了原则性指导，解耦μP参数化支持跨宽度和压缩机制的零样本超参数迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) apply uniform computation to all tokens, despite language exhibiting highly non-uniform information density. This token-uniform regime wastes capacity on locally predictable spans while under-allocating computation to semantically critical transitions. We propose $\textbf{Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM)}$, a hierarchical language modeling framework that learns semantic boundaries from latent representations and shifts computation from tokens to a compressed concept space where reasoning is more efficient. DLCM discovers variable-length concepts end-to-end without relying on predefined linguistic units. Hierarchical compression fundamentally changes scaling behavior. We introduce the first $\textbf{compression-aware scaling law}$, which disentangles token-level capacity, concept-level reasoning capacity, and compression ratio, enabling principled compute allocation under fixed FLOPs. To stably train this heterogeneous architecture, we further develop a $\textbf{decoupled $μ$P parametrization}$ that supports zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across widths and compression regimes. At a practical setting ($R=4$, corresponding to an average of four tokens per concept), DLCM reallocates roughly one-third of inference compute into a higher-capacity reasoning backbone, achieving a $\textbf{+2.69$\%$ average improvement}$ across 12 zero-shot benchmarks under matched inference FLOPs.

Conclusion: AutoFed为交通预测提供了一个有效的个性化联邦学习解决方案，无需手动超参数调优，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems, including ride-hailing, urban road planning, and vehicle fleet management. However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: 大规模logP预测框架：整合42.7万化合物数据，通过字节偏移索引将处理时间从100天降至3.2小时，发现分子量是最重要预测因子，树集成模型优于线性模型，分层建模策略取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决logP（脂溶性）预测中的大规模数据整合挑战，建立基于2D描述符的稳健预测模型，为分子设计提供指导，并与最先进的图神经网络架构竞争。

Method: 整合PubChem、ChEMBL、eMolecules三个数据库的426850个化合物；开发字节偏移索引架构实现740倍处理速度提升；使用SHAP分析识别关键预测因子；系统评估线性模型和树集成模型（随机森林、XGBoost）；采用分层建模策略（药物样分子91%和极端情况9%）。

Result: 分子量是全局最重要的logP预测因子；树集成模型对异方差性具有鲁棒性，测试集R²=0.765，RMSE=0.731；分层建模策略取得最优性能：药物样分子RMSE=0.838，极端分子R²=0.767；基于描述符的集成模型与图神经网络性能相当。

Conclusion: 精心策划的描述符集成模型在logP预测中仍具有竞争力；分层建模策略可优化性能；分子量是关键预测因子；树模型对数据异方差性更鲁棒；为分子设计提供了实用指导。

Abstract: This study presents a large-scale predictive modeling framework for logP prediction using 426850 bioactive compounds rigorously curated from the intersection of three authoritative chemical databases: PubChem, ChEMBL, and eMolecules. We developed a novel computational infrastructure to address the data integration challenge, reducing processing time from a projected over 100 days to 3.2 hours through byte-offset indexing architecture, a 740-fold improvement. Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches. These findings provide actionable guidance for molecular design, establish robust baselines for lipophilicity prediction using only 2D descriptors, and demonstrate that well-curated, descriptor-based ensemble models remain competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出HeteroHBA，一种针对异构图神经网络的生成式后门攻击框架，通过选择有影响力的辅助邻居、生成多样化的触发特征和连接模式，并利用AdaIN和MMD损失提高隐蔽性，在保持干净性能的同时实现高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构图神经网络（HGNNs）在实际应用中表现出色，但针对异构图的定向后门投毒攻击研究较少。现有攻击方法在异构图上的效果有限，需要开发更有效、隐蔽的后门攻击来揭示异构图的潜在安全风险。

Method: 1) 通过显著性筛选选择有影响力的辅助邻居进行触发节点连接；2) 生成多样化的触发特征和连接模式以匹配局部异质上下文；3) 结合自适应实例归一化（AdaIN）和最大均值差异（MMD）损失对齐触发特征分布与良性统计，提高隐蔽性；4) 使用双层优化目标联合促进攻击成功并保持干净准确率。

Result: 在多个真实世界异构图和代表性HGNN架构上的实验表明，HeteroHBA相比现有后门基线方法，在保持相当或更小对干净准确率影响的同时，实现了更高的攻击成功率。攻击在异构感知的结构防御CSD下仍然有效。

Conclusion: HeteroHBA揭示了异构图学习中实际的后门风险，强调了开发更强防御措施的必要性。该框架为理解异构图后门攻击提供了新视角，并推动了相关防御研究的发展。

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved strong performance in many real-world applications, yet targeted backdoor poisoning on heterogeneous graphs remains less studied. We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD. These results highlight practical backdoor risks in heterogeneous graph learning and motivate the development of stronger defenses.

Conclusion: 用户移动性可以有效提升去中心化联邦学习在稀疏网络中的性能，通过诱导移动模式利用数据分布知识进一步优化信息传播，为下一代移动网络中的DFL应用提供了新思路

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative training among users without relying on a central server. However, its performance often degrades significantly due to limited connectivity and data heterogeneity. As we move toward the next generation of wireless networks, mobility is increasingly embedded in many real-world applications. The user mobility, either natural or induced, enables clients to act as relays or bridges, thus enhancing information flow in sparse networks; however, its impact on DFL has been largely overlooked despite its potential. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of mobility in improving DFL performance. We first establish the convergence of DFL in sparse networks under user mobility and theoretically demonstrate that even random movement of a fraction of users can significantly boost performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a DFL framework that utilizes mobile users with induced mobility patterns, allowing them to exploit the knowledge of data distribution to determine their trajectories to enhance information propagation through the network. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm our theoretical findings, validate the superiority of our approach over baselines, and provide a comprehensive analysis of how various network parameters influence DFL performance in mobile networks.

Abstract: Despite the recent progresses, particularly in developing Language Models, there are fundamental challenges and unanswered questions about how such models can continually learn/memorize, self-improve, and find effective solutions. In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出DCL-DECOR方法，用于线性高斯系统中存在混合潜在混杂（全局+局部）时的因果发现，通过精度矩阵分解分离全局混杂效应，再用相关噪声DAG学习恢复因果图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中常存在混合潜在混杂：一些未观测因素广泛影响多个变量（全局混杂），另一些只影响小部分变量（局部混杂）。现有方法面临挑战：可微/基于分数的DAG学习可能将全局潜在效应误认为因果边，而潜在变量图模型只能恢复无向结构。

Method: 提出DCL-DECOR模块化精度导向流程：1) 将观测精度矩阵分解为结构化分量（去除全局混杂后的条件分布）和低秩分量（全局混杂效应）；2) 对去混杂表示应用相关噪声DAG学习恢复有向边，同时建模剩余结构化误差相关性；3) 简单协调步骤确保无弓形结构。

Result: 提供了混合混杂下可恢复因果目标的识别性结果，表明整体问题可分解为具有模块化保证的成熟子问题。合成实验显示，在不同强度和维度的全局混杂下，相比直接在混杂数据上应用相关噪声DAG学习，DCL-DECOR在有向边恢复方面持续改进。

Conclusion: DCL-DECOR能有效处理混合潜在混杂的因果发现问题，通过分离全局混杂效应和局部因果结构，在存在广泛混杂的实际场景中提供更好的因果图恢复性能。

Abstract: We study causal discovery from observational data in linear Gaussian systems affected by \emph{mixed latent confounding}, where some unobserved factors act broadly across many variables while others influence only small subsets. This setting is common in practice and poses a challenge for existing methods: differentiable and score-based DAG learners can misinterpret global latent effects as causal edges, while latent-variable graphical models recover only undirected structure.
  We propose \textsc{DCL-DECOR}, a modular, precision-led pipeline that separates these roles. The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.
  We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees. Synthetic experiments that vary the strength and dimensionality of pervasive confounding demonstrate consistent improvements in directed edge recovery over applying correlated-noise DAG learning directly to the confounded data.

Abstract: The challenge of effectively transferring knowledge across multiple tasks is of critical importance and is also present in downstream tasks with foundation models. However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.
  To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set. This semi-overlapping arm property defines a novel multi-bandit cost/reward structure utilized in BandiK.

To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.

Abstract: Autonomous taxi services represent a transformative advancement in urban mobility, offering safety, efficiency, and round-the-clock operations. While existing literature has explored user acceptance of autonomous taxis through stated preference experiments and hypothetical scenarios, few studies have investigated actual user behavior based on operational AV services. This study addresses that gap by leveraging survey data from Wuhan, China, where Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi service operates at scale. We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \& Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles. The model demonstrates strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices. Our findings offer empirical evidence to support policymaking, fare design, and public outreach strategies for scaling autonomous taxis deployments in real-world urban settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文证明：对于具有log-sum-exp结构的损失函数，梯度下降隐式执行期望最大化算法，优化与推理是同一过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络训练中出现的概率推理行为（软聚类、原型专业化、贝叶斯不确定性跟踪）通常被松散地类比为混合模型，缺乏直接的理论解释。本文旨在为这些现象提供严格的数学推导。

Method: 通过数学分析证明：对于任何具有log-sum-exp结构的损失函数（基于距离或能量），每个距离的梯度恰好等于对应分量的负后验责任：∂L/∂d_j = -r_j。这是一个代数恒等式，而非近似。

Result: 梯度下降在此类目标函数上隐式执行期望最大化算法——责任不是需要计算的辅助变量，而是需要应用的梯度。无需显式推理算法，因为推理已嵌入优化过程中。

Conclusion: 该结果将三种学习机制统一于单一框架：无监督混合建模（责任完全潜在）、注意力机制（责任以查询为条件）、交叉熵分类（监督将责任固定为目标）。Transformer中观察到的贝叶斯结构不是涌现属性，而是目标函数几何结构的必然结果。优化与推理是同一过程。

Abstract: Neural networks trained with standard objectives exhibit behaviors characteristic of probabilistic inference: soft clustering, prototype specialization, and Bayesian uncertainty tracking. These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\partial L / \partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry. Optimization and inference are the same process.

Conclusion: 提出的自监督学习方法有效解决了多模态NAS需要大量标注数据的问题，为无标注数据下的神经网络架构搜索提供了可行方案

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the architectural design process of deep neural networks (DNN), has attracted increasing attention. Multimodal DNNs that necessitate feature fusion from multiple modalities benefit from NAS due to their structural complexity; however, constructing an architecture for multimodal DNNs through NAS requires a substantial amount of labeled training data. Thus, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) method for architecture search of multimodal DNNs. The proposed method applies SSL comprehensively for both the architecture search and model pretraining processes. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method successfully designed architectures for DNNs from unlabeled training data.

Abstract: Precise probabilistic information about drug-target interaction (DTI) predictions is vital for understanding limitations and boosting predictive performance. Gaussian processes (GP) offer a scalable framework to integrate state-of-the-art DTI representations and Bayesian inference, enabling novel operations, such as Bayesian classification with rejection, top-$K$ selection, and ranking. We propose a deep kernel learning-based GP architecture (DTI-GP), which incorporates a combined neural embedding module for chemical compounds and protein targets, and a GP module. The workflow continues with sampling from the predictive distribution to estimate a Bayesian precedence matrix, which is used in fast and accurate selection and ranking operations. DTI-GP outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, and it allows (1) the construction of a Bayesian accuracy-confidence enrichment score, (2) rejection schemes for improved enrichment, and (3) estimation and search for top-$K$ selections and ranking with high expected utility.

Motivation: 传统偏好建模使用Bradley-Terry模型假设传递性，忽略了人类群体偏好的复杂性。NLHF将非传递性偏好建模为两人零和博弈，但现有算法依赖正则化，在计算原始博弈对偶间隙时会产生不可避免的偏差。

Method: 采用乐观乘性权重更新(OMWU)算法，分析其在NLHF中的收敛行为。该方法不需要纳什均衡唯一性假设，当存在完全支持的纳什均衡时，OMWU在预热阶段后实现最后迭代线性收敛。

Result: 理论分析表明OMWU以实例依赖的线性收敛率收敛到原始纳什均衡，发现了边际收敛行为：很少被选择动作的概率从指数小值指数增长，相比先前结果实现了指数级更好的实例依赖常数依赖关系。实验在表格和神经网络策略类中都验证了OMWU的理论优势。

Conclusion: OMWU在NLHF中具有理论保证的收敛性，无需纳什均衡唯一性假设，为LLM应用提供了有前景的算法基础，能够更好地处理人类偏好的非传递性复杂性。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has proven effective for enhancing model capabilities, yet standard preference modeling using the Bradley-Terry model assumes transitivity, overlooking the inherent complexity of human population preferences. Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results. Experiments corroborate the theoretical strengths of $\mathtt{OMWU}$ in both tabular and neural policy classes, demonstrating its potential for LLM applications.

TL;DR: 提出一种多智能体选项发现方法，通过联合状态抽象和费马状态近似来发现强协调行为，相比现有方法能产生更好的协调能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体环境中，联合状态空间随智能体数量呈指数增长，使得协调行为设计特别困难。现有方法往往牺牲协调性，产生松散耦合或完全独立的行为，需要新的方法来发现强协调的多智能体选项。

Method: 1) 提出联合状态抽象，压缩状态空间同时保留发现强协调行为所需信息；2) 基于智能体状态同步的归纳偏置，近似最大对齐的虚构状态（费马状态）；3) 定义"分散度"度量团队级不对齐程度；4) 使用神经图拉普拉斯估计器推导捕捉智能体间状态同步模式的选项。

Conclusion: 通过联合状态抽象和费马状态近似的方法能够有效发现多智能体协调选项，克服了现有方法协调性不足的问题，在多智能体环境中展现出更好的协调能力。

Abstract: Temporally extended actions improve the ability to explore and plan in single-agent settings. In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.

Conclusion: AODDiff作为生成模型，能够灵活适应多种重建任务而无需特定任务重训练，同时提供关键的不确定性量化能力，为下游应用提供置信度指标

Abstract: High-quality reconstruction of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) fields is critical for Atmosphere monitoring, yet current models remain constrained by the scarcity of complete training data and a lack of uncertainty quantification.To address these limitations, we propose AODDiff, a probabilistic reconstruction framework based on diffusion-based Bayesian inference. By leveraging the learned spatiotemporal probability distribution of the AOD field as a generative prior, this framework can be flexibly adapted to various reconstruction tasks without requiring task-specific retraining. We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity. Furthermore, as a generative model, AODDiff inherently enables uncertainty quantification via multiple sampling, offering critical confidence metrics for downstream applications.

Abstract: Transfer effects manifest themselves both during training using a fixed data set and in inductive inference using accumulating data. We hypothesize that perturbing the data set by including more samples, instead of perturbing the model by gradient updates, provides a complementary and more fundamental characterization of transfer effects. To capture this phenomenon, we quantitatively model transfer effects using multi-task learning curves approximating the inductive performance over varying sample sizes. We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training. We compare the statistical and computational approaches to transfer, which indicates considerably higher compute costs for the previous but better power and broader applicability. Evaluations are performed using a benchmark drug-target interaction data set. Our results show that learning curves can better capture the effects of multi-task learning and their multi-task extensions can delineate pairwise and contextual transfer effects in foundation models.

Abstract: Forecasting is critical in areas such as finance, biology, and healthcare. Despite the progress in the field, making accurate forecasts remains challenging because real-world time series contain both global trends, local fine-grained structure, and features on multiple scales in between. Here, we present a new forecasting method, PRISM (Partitioned Representation for Iterative Sequence Modeling), that addresses this challenge through a learnable tree-based partitioning of the signal. At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting. Overall, these results demonstrate that our hierarchical approach provides a lightweight and flexible framework for forecasting multivariate time series.

Abstract: Cognitive task classification using machine learning plays a central role in decoding brain states from neuroimaging data. By integrating machine learning with brain network analysis, complex connectivity patterns can be extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomes. This process transforms raw blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals into interpretable representations of cognitive processes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) further advance this paradigm by modeling brain regions as nodes and functional connections as edges, capturing topological dependencies and multi-scale interactions that are often missed by conventional approaches. Our proposed SpectralBrainGNN model, a spectral convolution framework based on graph Fourier transforms (GFT) computed via normalized Laplacian eigendecomposition. Experiments on the Human Connectome Project-Task (HCPTask) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.25\%. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/gnnplayground/SpectralBrainGNN to support reproducibility and future research.

Conclusion: FSF和FPH方法连接了频繁子图挖掘和拓扑数据分析，为拓扑感知特征提取提供了新视角，显著提升了图分类性能。

Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.

Conclusion: 为多任务学习、联邦学习等场景中的支持网络识别提供了理论基础和性能保证，展示了共享评估在顺序学习中的优势。

Abstract: Many modern AI and ML problems require evaluating partners' contributions through shared yet asymmetric, computationally intensive processes and the simultaneous selection of the most beneficial candidates. Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.
  We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.
  From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).

Conclusion: DMSAEs能够提取一致的核心特征集，实现跨稀疏度的特征迁移，提高稀疏自编码器的可复用性和解释性

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) aim to disentangle model activations into monosemantic, human-interpretable features. In practice, learned features are often redundant and vary across training runs and sparsity levels, which makes interpretations difficult to transfer and reuse. We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels

TL;DR: 提出使用梯度余弦相似度预测任务数据效率的方法，基于少量标注样本即可估计需要多少微调数据才能达到目标性能，避免不必要的标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在许多任务上表现出合理的零样本能力，但微调通常能提升性能。然而，任务的数据效率（即达到期望性能所需的微调样本数量）通常是未知的，导致昂贵的增量标注和重新训练循环。作者发现，在30个专门任务上，性能良好的LLM可能在零样本情况下表现不佳，但微调后能达到更强性能，这促使需要预测任务数据效率的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的梯度余弦相似度方法能够基于少量标注样本准确预测任务的数据效率，显著减少标注成本，为LLM微调提供实用的数据需求估计工具。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate reasonable zero-shot capability across many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is a common practice to improve their performance. However, a task's data efficiency--i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance--is often unknown, resulting in costly cycles of incremental annotation and retraining. Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task's data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples. We validate our approach on a diverse set of tasks with varying data efficiencies, attaining 8.6% error in overall data efficiency prediction and typically eliminating hundreds of unnecessary annotations on each task. Our experiment results and implementation code are available on GitHub.

*Haozhe Jiang,Nika Haghtalab,Lijie Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DLMs通过并行采样和CoT能最优模拟任何并行算法，但需要remasking或revision功能来优化空间复杂度，revision使DLMs表达能力更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型作为自回归模型的替代方案，具有并行生成的优势，但需要理论分析其效率和表达能力，特别是空间复杂度优化方面。

Method: 形式化并行采样模型，分析DLMs结合多项式长度CoT的模拟能力，研究remasking和revision功能对空间复杂度的影响，建立表达能力层次。

Result: DLMs+CoT能以最优顺序步数模拟任何并行采样算法；remasking或revision能进一步实现最优空间复杂度；revision使DLMs表达能力严格更强。

Conclusion: DLMs是最有效的并行采样器，建议在DLMs中启用revision功能以优化空间复杂度和表达能力。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models for faster inference via parallel token generation. We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs.

*Timo Kaufmann,Yannick Metz,Daniel Keim,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ResponseRank：一种利用局部相对强度信号（如响应时间、标注者一致性）来学习偏好强度的方法，相比传统二元选择能更高效、鲁棒地学习效用差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF中的二元选择只能传达偏好方向，无法衡量偏好强度。偏好强度对于不确定性下的决策和偏好模型泛化至关重要，但难以可靠测量。现有代理信号（如响应时间、标注者一致性）通常噪声大且存在混淆因素。

Method: 提出ResponseRank方法：利用代理信号的相对差异对成对比较中的响应进行偏好强度排序。通过构建精心设计的层（strata）进行局部比较，控制系统性变异。该方法对强度信号做出最小假设，能鲁棒地学习与强度排序一致的效用差异。

Result: 在三个任务上验证：合成偏好学习（模拟响应时间）、语言建模（标注者一致性）、RL控制任务（模拟回合回报）。结果显示提高了样本效率和鲁棒性。同时提出了Pearson距离相关性（PDC）这一新指标，用于从序数准确性中分离基数效用学习。

Conclusion: ResponseRank能够从噪声强度信号中鲁棒地学习偏好强度，相比传统二元选择方法在样本效率和鲁棒性方面有显著改进，为偏好学习提供了更丰富的强度信息。

Abstract: Binary choices, as often used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), convey only the direction of a preference. A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.

*Alexander C. Li,Ananya Kumar,Deepak Pathak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 生成式分类器通过建模所有特征（包括核心和虚假特征）来避免虚假相关性，在分布偏移下表现优于判别式分类器


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 判别式分类器在分布偏移下容易失败，因为它们过度依赖与标签虚假相关的特征。需要一种能避免这种问题的分类方法。

Method: 使用基于扩散模型和自回归模型的生成式分类器，这些模型通过类条件生成模型来建模所有特征，而不是主要关注虚假特征。

Result: 在五个标准的图像和文本分布偏移基准测试中达到最先进性能，在医疗和卫星数据集等实际应用中减少虚假相关性的影响。

Conclusion: 生成式分类器能有效避免虚假相关性问题，训练简单且无需专门的数据增强、强正则化或额外超参数，在分布偏移下表现优于判别式分类器。

Abstract: Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.

TL;DR: 研究发现，Clock和Pizza两种注意力架构实际上实现了相同的算法，具有拓扑和几何等价的表示，而非不同的电路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究认为不同注意力架构（均匀注意力与可学习注意力）会产生不同的模加电路，本文旨在验证这一观点是否正确。

Method: 超越单个神经元和权重的解释，识别所有对应每个学习表示的神经元，将神经元群体作为一个整体研究，利用拓扑学工具分析学习表示作为流形的特性。

Result: 通过统计分析数百个电路的学习表示，发现两种架构实现的模加电路具有相似性，学习表示在拓扑和几何上是等价的。

Conclusion: Clock和Pizza两种注意力架构实际上实现了相同的算法，具有等价的表示，挑战了先前关于不同架构产生不同电路的观点。

Abstract: The Clock and Pizza interpretations, associated with architectures differing in either uniform or learnable attention, were introduced to argue that different architectural designs can yield distinct circuits for modular addition. In this work, we show that this is not the case, and that both uniform attention and trainable attention architectures implement the same algorithm via topologically and geometrically equivalent representations. Our methodology goes beyond the interpretation of individual neurons and weights. Instead, we identify all of the neurons corresponding to each learned representation and then study the collective group of neurons as one entity. This method reveals that each learned representation is a manifold that we can study utilizing tools from topology. Based on this insight, we can statistically analyze the learned representations across hundreds of circuits to demonstrate the similarity between learned modular addition circuits that arise naturally from common deep learning paradigms.

Motivation: 现代Transformer通常训练为单一确定性系统，但智能可能源于多样化的"思维"。作者希望从单一预训练模型中获得多样化的模型实例，实现群体智慧

Method: 提出B-Trans：将归一化层中的偏置偏移视为具有高斯变分近似的随机变量，创建贝叶斯后验代理；在序列级别冻结采样噪声以确保时间一致性；支持从单一权重采样多样模型实例

Result: 在零样本生成、RLVR和无需显式标签的RL任务中，B-Trans通过群体决策显著提升了语义多样性，同时获得了比确定性基线更好的任务性能

Conclusion: B-Trans成功将标准LLM转换为贝叶斯Transformer，通过从单一预训练权重采样多样模型实例实现了群体智慧，在保持通用能力的同时提升了探索能力和任务性能

Abstract: Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.
  B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险的决策需要在不确定性下对未来进行推理，需要开发能够进行开放式预测的语言模型，但缺乏大规模训练数据和防止未来信息泄露的系统。

Method: 1) 从每日新闻中自动化合成预测问题；2) 使用离线新闻语料防止信息泄露；3) 训练Qwen3思考模型；4) 结合检索机制；5) 改进强化学习奖励函数；6) 在2025年5-8月进行保留测试。

Conclusion: 通过自动化数据合成和专门训练，可以开发出高效的语言模型预测系统，在保持较小规模的同时达到与大型专有模型相当的性能，为语言模型预测研究提供了可访问的基础设施。

Abstract: High-stakes decision making involves reasoning under uncertainty about the future. In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.

### [111] [Fitted Q Evaluation Without Bellman Completeness via Stationary Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23805)
*Lars van der Laan,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出一种改进的FQE方法，通过重新加权回归步骤来对齐贝尔曼算子的收缩范数，从而在无需贝尔曼完备性的情况下实现更强的评估保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FQE方法需要贝尔曼完备性假设（假设类在评估贝尔曼算子下封闭），但扩大假设类可能破坏完备性。这种需求源于范数不匹配：贝尔曼算子在目标策略的平稳分布下是γ-收缩的，而FQE在行为分布下最小化贝尔曼误差。

Method: 提出简单修正：在每次回归步骤中使用平稳密度比估计进行重新加权，使FQE与贝尔曼算子收缩的范数对齐。这保持了基于回归评估的实用性，同时避免了标准FQE在无实现性或贝尔曼完备性情况下的几何误差放大。

Result: 该方法能够在无需实现性或贝尔曼完备性的情况下提供强大的评估保证，避免了标准FQE在此设置下的几何误差放大问题。

Conclusion: 通过重新加权回归步骤来对齐范数，可以克服传统FQE对贝尔曼完备性的依赖，在更一般的设置下实现可靠的政策评估，同时保持方法的实用性。

Abstract: Fitted Q-evaluation (FQE) is a central method for off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, but it generally requires Bellman completeness: that the hypothesis class is closed under the evaluation Bellman operator. This requirement is challenging because enlarging the hypothesis class can worsen completeness. We show that the need for this assumption stems from a fundamental norm mismatch: the Bellman operator is gamma-contractive under the stationary distribution of the target policy, whereas FQE minimizes Bellman error under the behavior distribution. We propose a simple fix: reweight each regression step using an estimate of the stationary density ratio, thereby aligning FQE with the norm in which the Bellman operator contracts. This enables strong evaluation guarantees in the absence of realizability or Bellman completeness, avoiding the geometric error blow-up of standard FQE in this setting while maintaining the practicality of regression-based evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文扩展了Tweedie公式到更广泛的能量模型（椭圆分布），建立了去噪后验与能量评分规则的联系，并推导出连接能量评分路径导数与噪声边缘分布评分的基本恒等式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Tweedie公式主要适用于特定分布，限制了其在更广泛能量模型中的应用。本文旨在扩展这一经典关系，探索去噪后验与能量评分规则之间的深层联系，为更广泛的噪声分布提供理论框架。

Method: 1. 将Tweedie公式扩展到椭圆分布（能量模型）；2. 将去噪后验视为能量评分规则的优化器；3. 推导连接能量评分路径导数与噪声边缘分布评分的基本恒等式；4. 建立能量评分Tweedie恒等式。

Result: 成功推导出能量评分版本的Tweedie恒等式，该恒等式连接了能量评分的路径导数与噪声边缘分布的评分函数。这一理论框架支持多个应用：评分估计、噪声分布参数估计，以及在传统扩散模型采样器中使用更广泛的噪声分布。

Conclusion: 本文建立了去噪后验与能量评分规则之间的理论联系，扩展了Tweedie公式的应用范围。推导出的基本恒等式为评分估计、参数估计和扩散模型采样提供了新的理论工具，特别是在非欧几里得能量评分和非传统噪声分布的场景下。

Abstract: Denoising and score estimation have long been known to be linked via the classical Tweedie's formula. In this work, we first extend the latter to a wider range of distributions often called "energy models" and denoted elliptical distributions in this work. Next, we examine an alternative view: we consider the denoising posterior $P(X|Y)$ as the optimizer of the energy score (a scoring rule) and derive a fundamental identity that connects the (path-) derivative of a (possibly) non-Euclidean energy score to the score of the noisy marginal. This identity can be seen as an analog of Tweedie's identity for the energy score, and allows for several interesting applications; for example, score estimation, noise distribution parameter estimation, as well as using energy score models in the context of "traditional" diffusion model samplers with a wider array of noising distributions.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文分析了软FQI在函数逼近下的不稳定性，提出使用当前策略的平稳分布重新加权的改进方法，证明了局部线性收敛性，并建议通过逐渐降低温度实现全局收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的FQI及其熵正则化变体（软FQI）在函数逼近和分布偏移下表现不佳。研究发现软贝尔曼算子在软最优策略的平稳范数下是局部收缩的，而非传统FQI使用的行为范数，这种几何不匹配解释了软Q迭代在缺乏贝尔曼完备性时的不稳定性。

Method: 提出平稳重新加权的软FQI方法，在每次回归更新中使用当前策略的平稳分布进行重新加权。该方法在近似可实现性假设下，通过几何阻尼权重估计误差实现局部线性收敛。

Result: 证明了平稳重新加权的软FQI在函数逼近下具有局部线性收敛性。分析还表明，通过逐渐降低软最大温度可以实现全局收敛，并且在温和边界条件下可以扩展到硬最大极限。

Conclusion: 通过识别软贝尔曼算子的几何不匹配问题，提出平稳重新加权的软FQI方法，有效解决了函数逼近下的不稳定性问题，为离线强化学习提供了更稳定的价值迭代框架。

Abstract: Fitted Q-iteration (FQI) and its entropy-regularized variant, soft FQI, are central tools for value-based model-free offline reinforcement learning, but can behave poorly under function approximation and distribution shift. In the entropy-regularized setting, we show that the soft Bellman operator is locally contractive in the stationary norm of the soft-optimal policy, rather than in the behavior norm used by standard FQI. This geometric mismatch explains the instability of soft Q-iteration with function approximation in the absence of Bellman completeness. To restore contraction, we introduce stationary-reweighted soft FQI, which reweights each regression update using the stationary distribution of the current policy. We prove local linear convergence under function approximation with geometrically damped weight-estimation errors, assuming approximate realizability. Our analysis further suggests that global convergence may be recovered by gradually reducing the softmax temperature, and that this continuation approach can extend to the hardmax limit under a mild margin condition.

*Shinto Eguchi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出γ-Flow Matching，一种密度加权的流匹配方法，通过动态密度加权策略减少高维空间中低密度区域的回归损失，提高采样效率和向量场平滑度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准流匹配方法在高维空间中存在效率问题：大部分积分域是低密度"空洞"区域，这些区域的向量场往往混乱或定义不清，导致无加权的L²回归效率低下。

Method: 提出γ-Flow Matching（γ-FM），采用动态密度加权策略，直接从训练粒子估计目标密度，动态降低空洞区域的回归损失，同时保持流匹配的无模拟特性。

Result: γ-FM显著提高了高维潜在数据集上的向量场平滑度和采样效率，同时表现出对异常值的固有鲁棒性。理论分析表明该方法在γ-Stein度量的统计流形上最小化传输成本。

Conclusion: γ-Flow Matching通过密度加权改进了标准流匹配方法，在高维空间中更有效地对齐回归几何与底层概率流，解决了空洞区域的问题，提高了生成模型的性能。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for continuous normalizing flows, yet standard FM implicitly performs an unweighted $L^2$ regression over the entire ambient space. In high dimensions, this leads to a fundamental inefficiency: the vast majority of the integration domain consists of low-density ``void'' regions where the target velocity fields are often chaotic or ill-defined. In this paper, we propose {$γ$-Flow Matching ($γ$-FM)}, a density-weighted variant that aligns the regression geometry with the underlying probability flow. While density weighting is desirable, naive implementations would require evaluating the intractable target density. We circumvent this by introducing a Dynamic Density-Weighting strategy that estimates the \emph{target} density directly from training particles. This approach allows us to dynamically downweight the regression loss in void regions without compromising the simulation-free nature of FM. Theoretically, we establish that $γ$-FM minimizes the transport cost on a statistical manifold endowed with the $γ$-Stein metric. Spectral analysis further suggests that this geometry induces an implicit Sobolev regularization, effectively damping high-frequency oscillations in void regions. Empirically, $γ$-FM significantly improves vector field smoothness and sampling efficiency on high-dimensional latent datasets, while demonstrating intrinsic robustness to outliers.

Abstract: In this paper, we construct a class of stochastic interpolation neural network operators (SINNOs) with random coefficients activated by sigmoidal functions. We establish their boundedness, interpolation accuracy, and approximation capabilities in the mean square sense, in probability, as well as path-wise within the space of second-order stochastic (random) processes \( L^2(Ω, \mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}) \). Additionally, we provide quantitative error estimates using the modulus of continuity of the processes. These results highlight the effectiveness of SINNOs for approximating stochastic processes with potential applications in COVID-19 case prediction.

Conclusion: 提出的拓扑空间图粗化方法能有效平衡图简化与拓扑特征保持，为空间图分析提供了实用的简化工具

Abstract: Spatial graphs are particular graphs for which the nodes are localized in space (e.g., public transport network, molecules, branching biological structures). In this work, we consider the problem of spatial graph reduction, that aims to find a smaller spatial graph (i.e., with less nodes) with the same overall structure as the initial one. In this context, performing the graph reduction while preserving the main topological features of the initial graph is particularly relevant, due to the additional spatial information. Thus, we propose a topological spatial graph coarsening approach based on a new framework that finds a trade-off between the graph reduction and the preservation of the topological characteristics. The coarsening is realized by collapsing short edges. In order to capture the topological information required to calibrate the reduction level, we adapt the construction of classical topological descriptors made for point clouds (the so-called persistent diagrams) to spatial graphs. This construction relies on the introduction of a new filtration called triangle-aware graph filtration. Our coarsening approach is parameter-free and we prove that it is equivariant under rotations, translations and scaling of the initial spatial graph. We evaluate the performances of our method on synthetic and real spatial graphs, and show that it significantly reduces the graph sizes while preserving the relevant topological information.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and its variants approximate the likelihood of an entire dataset, via random (and typically much smaller) subsets, in the setting of Bayesian sampling. Due to the (often substantial) improvement of the computational efficiency, they have been widely used in large-scale machine learning applications. It has been demonstrated that the so-called covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin (CCAdL) thermostat, which incorporates an additional term involving the covariance matrix of the noisy force, outperforms popular alternative methods. A moving average is used in CCAdL to estimate the covariance matrix of the noisy force, in which case the covariance matrix will converge to a constant matrix in long-time limit. Moreover, it appears in our numerical experiments that the use of a moving average could reduce the stability of the numerical integrators, thereby limiting the largest usable stepsize. In this article, we propose a modified CCAdL (i.e., mCCAdL) thermostat that uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential to numerically approximate the exact solution to the subsystem involving the additional term proposed in CCAdL. We also propose a symmetric splitting method for mCCAdL, instead of an Euler-type discretisation used in the original CCAdL thermostat. We demonstrate in our numerical experiments that the newly proposed mCCAdL thermostat achieves a substantial improvement in the numerical stability over the original CCAdL thermostat, while significantly outperforming popular alternative stochastic gradient methods in terms of the numerical accuracy for large-scale machine learning applications.

We focus on test-time filtering: a lightweight mechanism for behavior control that compares performance scores to estimated thresholds, and modifies outputs when these bounds are violated. We formalize the problem of enforcing multiple risk constraints with user-defined priorities, and introduce two efficient dynamic programming algorithms that leverage this sequential structure. The first, MULTIRISK-BASE, provides a direct finite-sample procedure for selecting thresholds, while the second, MULTIRISK, leverages data exchangeability to guarantee simultaneous control of the risks. Under mild assumptions, we show that MULTIRISK achieves nearly tight control of all constraint risks. The analysis requires an intricate iterative argument, upper bounding the risks by introducing several forms of intermediate symmetrized risk functions, and carefully lower bounding the risks by recursively counting jumps in symmetrized risk functions between appropriate risk levels. We evaluate our framework on a three-constraint Large Language Model alignment task using the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, where the goal is to maximize helpfulness subject to multiple safety constraints, and where scores are generated by a Large Language Model judge and a perplexity filter. Our experimental results show that our algorithm can control each individual risk at close to the target level.

Motivation: 离线强化学习在高维稀疏MDP中面临两大挑战：1）数据可能被对手任意污染；2）样本数N小于特征维度d时，传统方法无法有效利用稀疏性。现有LSVI方法在均匀覆盖下表现良好，但在稀疏性和单策略集中性覆盖条件下存在局限性。

Method: 提出了基于演员-评论家框架的稀疏鲁棒估计算法：1）避免使用点式悲观奖励；2）集成稀疏鲁棒估计器；3）在单策略集中性覆盖条件下工作；4）扩展到污染设置，保持对强污染的鲁棒性。

Result: 首次在高维稀疏MDP中获得了单策略集中性覆盖和污染条件下的非平凡理论保证。算法在传统鲁棒离线强化学习方法可能失效的机制下，仍能学习到接近最优的策略。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了在高维稀疏MDP中，即使在数据污染和有限覆盖条件下，学习接近最优策略仍然是可能的。提出的稀疏鲁棒估计算法克服了传统LSVI方法的局限性，为稀疏离线强化学习提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: We investigate robustness to strong data corruption in offline sparse reinforcement learning (RL). In our setting, an adversary may arbitrarily perturb a fraction of the collected trajectories from a high-dimensional but sparse Markov decision process, and our goal is to estimate a near optimal policy. The main challenge is that, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $N$ is smaller than the feature dimension $d$, exploiting sparsity is essential for obtaining non-vacuous guarantees but has not been systematically studied in offline RL. We analyse the problem under uniform coverage and sparse single-concentrability assumptions. While Least Square Value Iteration (LSVI), a standard approach for robust offline RL, performs well under uniform coverage, we show that integrating sparsity into LSVI is unnatural, and its analysis may break down due to overly pessimistic bonuses. To overcome this, we propose actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimator oracles, which avoid the use of pointwise pessimistic bonuses and provide the first non-vacuous guarantees for sparse offline RL under single-policy concentrability coverage. Moreover, we extend our results to the contaminated setting and show that our algorithm remains robust under strong contamination. Our results provide the first non-vacuous guarantees in high-dimensional sparse MDPs with single-policy concentrability coverage and corruption, showing that learning a near-optimal policy remains possible in regimes where traditional robust offline RL techniques may fail.

*Yuchen Jiao,Na Li,Changxiao Cai,Gen Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了高阶ODE求解器是加速扩散模型采样的唯一路径的观点，提出了一种训练免费的一阶采样器，通过优化DPM评估的时间点位置来提升采样质量。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前普遍认为高阶ODE求解器是加速扩散概率模型采样的标准方法，而一阶方法天生较慢。本文挑战这一观点，认为除了求解器阶数外，DPM评估在反向时间动态中的位置安排对低NFE（神经函数评估）下的采样精度有重要影响。

Method: 提出了一种训练免费的一阶采样器，其核心思想是：1）使主导离散化误差的符号与DDIM相反；2）通过廉价的一步前瞻预测器近似前向值评估；3）理论证明该采样器能近似理想前向值轨迹并保持一阶收敛性。

Result: 在标准图像生成基准测试（CIFAR-10、ImageNet、FFHQ、LSUN）上，在相同NFE预算下，该采样器持续提升样本质量，有时能与甚至超越最先进的高阶采样器竞争。

Conclusion: DPM评估的时间点位置安排为加速扩散采样提供了一个额外且基本独立的设计维度，挑战了单纯依赖提高求解器阶数的传统加速思路。

Abstract: Higher-order ODE solvers have become a standard tool for accelerating diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) sampling, motivating the widespread view that first-order methods are inherently slower and that increasing discretization order is the primary path to faster generation. This paper challenges this belief and revisits acceleration from a complementary angle: beyond solver order, the placement of DPM evaluations along the reverse-time dynamics can substantially affect sampling accuracy in the low-neural function evaluation (NFE) regime.
  We propose a novel training-free, first-order sampler whose leading discretization error has the opposite sign to that of DDIM. Algorithmically, the method approximates the forward-value evaluation via a cheap one-step lookahead predictor. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers. Overall, the results suggest that the placement of DPM evaluations provides an additional and largely independent design angle for accelerating diffusion sampling.
