Desalination processes are highly\nenergy intensive and account for approximately 15% of the UAE's electricity\nconsumption, contributing to over 22% of the country's energy-related CO2\nemissions. Moreover, these processes face significant sustainability challenges\nin the face of climate uncertainties such as rising seawater temperatures,\nsalinity, and aerosol optical depth (AOD). AOD greatly affects the operational\nand economic performance of solar-powered desalination systems through\nphotovoltaic soiling, membrane fouling, and water turbidity cycles.\n  This study proposes a novel pipelined two-stage predictive modelling\narchitecture: the first stage forecasts AOD using satellite-derived time series\nand meteorological data; the second stage uses the predicted AOD and other\nmeteorological factors to predict desalination performance efficiency losses.\nThe framework achieved 98% accuracy, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)\nwas used to reveal key drivers of system degradation. Furthermore, this study\nproposes a dust-aware rule-based control logic for desalination systems based\non predicted values of AOD and solar efficiency. This control logic is used to\nadjust the desalination plant feed water pressure, adapt maintenance\nscheduling, and regulate energy source switching.\n  To enhance the practical utility of the research findings, the predictive\nmodels and rule-based controls were packaged into an interactive dashboard for\nscenario and predictive analytics.

A Perspective from Data Dimensionality Reduction", "comment": "Accepted by ICML2025 as a poster", "summary": "In recent years, contrastive learning has achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance in the territory of self-supervised representation learning. Many\nprevious works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding\nunderlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a\ndefault assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold\nin practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the\nstrength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random\nresized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling\nerror on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We\nfirst reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on\ndownstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality\nreduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on\noriginal data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical\nand empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a\ndouble-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream\nclassification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation\ngraph. Based on the above observations, we give the augmentation suggestion\nthat we should use some moderate embedding dimension (such as $512, 1024$ in\nour experiments), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD to ensure large\ngraph connectivity and small labeling error to improve model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u964d\u7ef4\uff08\u5982SVD\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u5047\u9633\u6027\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0SVD\u7684\u53cc\u5203\u5251\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7b49\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u81a8\u80c0\u3001\u5f31\u589e\u5f3a\u548cSVD\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u6807\u7b7e\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u964d\u7ef4\uff08\u5982SVD\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u5047\u9633\u6027\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86SVD\u5bf9\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u7b7e\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u98ce\u9669\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002SVD\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5047\u9633\u6027\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u964d\u4f4e\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7b49\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u81a8\u80c0\u3001\u5f31\u589e\u5f3a\u548cSVD\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper\ninvestigates the optimization of the sensing accuracy of a UAV swarm deployed\nto perform multi-baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)\nsensing. In conventional single-baseline InSAR systems, only one synthetic\naperture radar (SAR) antenna pair acquires two SAR images from two distinct\nangles to generate a digital elevation model (DEM) of the target area. However,\nmulti-baseline InSAR extends this concept by aggregating multiple acquisitions\nfrom different angles, thus, significantly enhancing the vertical accuracy of\nthe DEM. The heavy computations required for this process are performed on the\nground and, therefore, the radar data is transmitted in real time to a ground\nstation (GS) via a frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) air-to-ground\nbackhaul link. This work focuses on improving the sensing precision by\nminimizing the height error of the averaged DEM while simultaneously ensuring\nsensing and communication quality-of-service (QoS). To this end, the UAV\nformation, velocity, and communication power allocation are jointly optimized\nusing evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Our approach is benchmarked against\nestablished optimization methods, including genetic algorithms (GAs), simulated\nannealing (SA), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques.

Specifically,\nutilizing sparse/incomplete measured data, a time-dependent optimization\nproblem is formulated for determining the expansion coefficients of an\nassociated low-dimensional representation of the stochastic wind field.\nCompared to an alternative, standard, compressive sampling treatment of the\nproblem, the developed methodology exhibits the following advantages. First,\nthe Bayesian formulation enables also the quantification of the uncertainty in\nthe estimates. Second, the requirement in standard CS-based applications for an\na priori selection of the expansion basis is circumvented. Instead, this is\ndone herein in an adaptive manner based on the acquired data. Overall, the\nmethodology exhibits enhanced extrapolation accuracy, even in cases of\nhigh-dimensional data of arbitrary form, and of relatively large extrapolation\ndistances. Thus, it can be used, potentially, in a wide range of wind\nengineering applications where various constraints dictate the use of a limited\nnumber of sensors. The efficacy of the methodology is demonstrated by\nconsidering two case studies. The first relates to the extrapolation of\nsimulated wind velocity records consistent with a prescribed joint\nwavenumber-frequency power spectral density in a three-dimensional domain (2D\nand time).

Our primary\nmotivation is to rigorously examine the exploration-exploitation trade-off in\nthe context of sampling. We systematically define plausible notions of regret\nfor this framework and establish corresponding lower bounds. We then propose a\nsimple algorithm that achieves these optimal regret bounds. Our theoretical\nresults demonstrate that in contrast to optimization, sampling does not require\nexploration.

Subsequently,\nHierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing\nnodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood\nattributes. The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups\nwith nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster\nstructure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors.\nFinally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information\nacross multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node\nrepresentations.

DALI-PD uses a diffusion model to generate diverse layout\nheatmaps via fast inference in seconds. The heatmaps include power, IR drop,\ncongestion, macro placement, and cell density maps. Using DALI-PD, we created a\ndataset comprising over 20,000 layout configurations with varying macro counts\nand placements.

However, label noise, which\narises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training\ninstability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with\nnoise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these\nchallenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in\nnoisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates\nnoise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity\nand improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive\nAdjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label\ngeneration and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class\ndistributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully\nmanaging noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual\napproach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during\nlocal training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate\nFedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical\ndatasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric,\nextreme, and heterogeneous types.

While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep\nlearning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective\nplayer and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction.\nHowever, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of\ninteractions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling\nmatch dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous\nInteraction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep\nlearning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a\nmulti-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player\ndynamics and high-level team interactions.

However,\nprevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training\ninstability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty\nmismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's\ncurrent capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled\nlearning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more\nresource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid\nPolicy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning\nframework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive\nprompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively\nbalances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's\nreach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks,\neffectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of\napproximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently\noutperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning\nbaselines.

While recent\nstudies have introduced some methods to improve prediction performance, these\napproaches still face a significant challenge in handling long-term\nextrapolation tasks under such complex scenarios. To overcome this challenge,\nwe propose Phy-SSM, a generalizable method that integrates partial physics\nknowledge into state space models (SSMs) for long-term dynamics forecasting in\ncomplex environments. Our motivation is that SSMs can effectively capture\nlong-range dependencies in sequential data and model continuous dynamical\nsystems, while the incorporation of physics knowledge improves generalization\nability. The key challenge lies in how to seamlessly incorporate partially\nknown physics into SSMs. To achieve this, we decompose partially known system\ndynamics into known and unknown state matrices, which are integrated into a\nPhy-SSM unit. To further enhance long-term prediction performance, we introduce\na physics state regularization term to make the estimated latent states align\nwith system dynamics. Besides, we theoretically analyze the uniqueness of the\nsolutions for our method. Extensive experiments on three real-world\napplications, including vehicle motion prediction, drone state prediction, and\nCOVID-19 epidemiology forecasting, demonstrate the superior performance of\nPhy-SSM over the baselines in both long-term interpolation and extrapolation\ntasks.

The journal version will be updated soon", "summary": "Assortment optimization involves selecting a subset of substitutable products\n(subject to certain constraints) to maximize the expected revenue. It is a\nclassic problem in revenue management and finds applications across various\nindustries. However, the problem is usually NP-hard due to its combinatorial\nand non-linear nature. In this work, we explore how graph concolutional\nnetworks (GCNs) can be leveraged to efficiently solve constrained assortment\noptimization under the mixed multinomial logit choice model. We first develop a\ngraph representation of the assortment problem, then train a GCN to learn the\npatterns of optimal assortments, and lastly propose two inference policies\nbased on the GCN's output. Due to the GCN's inherent ability to generalize\nacross inputs of varying sizes, we can use a GCN trained on small-scale\ninstances to facilitate large-scale instances.

One-shot coreset selection addresses this by pruning\nthe dataset while maintaining or even improving model performance, often\nrelying on training-dynamics-based data difficulty scores. However, most\nexisting methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty,\noverlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes.\n  In this work, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such\nas network intrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often\nclusters by class. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and\nintroduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a\nquantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with\nperformance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to\noverrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones.\n  To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple\nsampling strategies. Evaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and\nmedical domains, our methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art data\nefficiency. For instance, on CTU-13, at an extreme 99% pruning rate, a\nclass-proportional variant of Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS-CP) shows\nremarkable stability, with accuracy dropping only 2.58%, precision 0.49%, and\nrecall 0.19%. In contrast, the class-agnostic CCS baseline, the next best\nmethod, suffers sharper declines of 7.59% in accuracy, 4.57% in precision, and\n4.11% in recall.\n  We further show that aggressive pruning enhances generalization in noisy,\nimbalanced, and large-scale datasets.

Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual\nsimilarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it\ndifficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional\ngradient-based methods prioritise $\\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing\nadversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making\nthem detectable.

The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical\nfeatures into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve\nstatistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to\nmeasure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically\nindistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly\navailable datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method\nachieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance\ncompared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted\nfrom image domain approaches.

Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods\noften rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,\nunder the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained\nfull-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach\nintroduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages\nprecomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian\nsubmatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models\nand benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical\nGPTQ method.

Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS)\nfingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its\ncompatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve\naccuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but\nthey assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to\nincorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of\nreal-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous\nmobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS\nreadings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models\nby encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal\nrelationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise\ndistributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded\naccuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these\nchallenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive\ngraph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor\nstate-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to\nmitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity.

While some\nartificial intelligence models have been developed, they often operate as black\nboxes, lacking the interpretability needed for clinical trust. Moreover, these\nmodels typically evaluate nodes in isolation, overlooking the patient-level\ncontext. To address these limitations, we introduce LRMR, an LLM-Driven\nRelational Multi-node Ranking framework. This approach reframes the diagnostic\ntask from a direct classification problem into a structured reasoning and\nranking process. The LRMR framework operates in two stages. First, a multimodal\nlarge language model (LLM) analyzes a composite montage image of all LNs from a\npatient, generating a structured report that details ten distinct radiological\nfeatures. Second, a text-based LLM performs pairwise comparisons of these\nreports between different patients, establishing a relative risk ranking based\non the severity and number of adverse features. We evaluated our method on a\nretrospective cohort of 117 rectal cancer patients. LRMR achieved an area under\nthe curve (AUC) of 0.7917 and an F1-score of 0.7200, outperforming a range of\ndeep learning baselines, including ResNet50 (AUC 0.7708). Ablation studies\nconfirmed the value of our two main contributions: removing the relational\nranking stage or the structured prompting stage led to a significant\nperformance drop, with AUCs falling to 0.6875 and 0.6458, respectively.

Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable.\nNevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ\nfixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air\ntransmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address\nthis limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework\nfor communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank\nconfiguration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted\nprojections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential\ndecision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates\ncoarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic\ncomplexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models\n(DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The\ntwo modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the\nClassifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards.\nExperiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM\nconsistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing\ntransmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven,\ndiffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning\nover the air.", "AI": {"tldr": "AirLLM\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5LoRA\u9002\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316LoRA\u7684\u79e9\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u9762\u4e34\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u79e9\u914d\u7f6e\u53ca\u53c2\u6570\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "AirLLM\u5c06\u79e9\u914d\u7f6e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PPO\u751f\u6210\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7DDIM\u7ec6\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u79e9\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\uff0cAirLLM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "AirLLM\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5fae\u8c03\u3002"}}

Our approach incorporates physical priors -- such as inertia,\ndamping, a learned potential function, and stochastic forces -- to represent\nboth autonomous and non-autonomous processes in neural systems. Crucially, the\npotential function is parameterized as a network of locally coupled\noscillators, biasing the model toward oscillatory and flow-like behaviors\nobserved in biological neural populations. Our model features a recurrent\nencoder, a one-layer Transformer decoder, and Langevin dynamics in the latent\nspace. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on\nsynthetic neural populations generated by a Lorenz attractor, closely matching\nground-truth firing rates.
