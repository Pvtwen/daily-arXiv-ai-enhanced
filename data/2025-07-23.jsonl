Typical RIS implementations include\nmetasurfaces with passive unit elements capable to reflect their incident waves\nin controllable ways. However, this solely reflective operation induces\nsignificant challenges in the RIS orchestration from the wireless network. For\nexample, channel estimation, which is essential for coherent RIS-empowered\nwireless communications, is quite challenging with the available solely\nreflecting RIS designs. This chapter reviews the emerging concept of Hybrid\nReflecting and Sensing RISs (HRISs), which enables metasurfaces to reflect the\nimpinging signal in a controllable manner, while simultaneously sensing a\nportion of it. The sensing capability of HRISs facilitates various network\nmanagement functionalities, including channel parameter estimation and\nlocalization, while, most importantly, giving rise to computationally\nautonomous and self-configuring RISs. The implementation details of HRISs are\nfirst presented, which are then followed by a convenient mathematical model for\ncharacterizing their dual functionality. Then, two indicative applications of\nHRISs are discussed, one for simultaneous communications and sensing and\nanother that showcases their usefulness for estimating the individual channels\nin the uplink of a multi-user HRIS-empowered communication system. For both of\nthese applications, performance evaluation results are included validating the\nrole of HRISs for sensing as well as integrated sensing and communications."}

However, in multi-user settings where interacting\nagents are trained independently-without shared context or joint\noptimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead\nto semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of\ntraditional transmission errors.

Meanwhile,\nthe field of identifiability theory has developed methods like Independent\nComponent Analysis (ICA) to identify latent sources and mixing weights from\ndata. While these two research communities have developed largely\nindependently, they aim to achieve similar goals: the accurate and\nsample-efficient estimation of model parameters. In the partially linear\nregression (PLR) setting, Mackey et al. (2018) recently found that estimation\nconsistency can be improved with non-Gaussian treatment noise. Non-Gaussianity\nis also a crucial assumption for identifying latent factors in ICA. We provide\nthe first theoretical and empirical insights into this connection, showing that\nICA can be used for causal effect estimation in the PLR model. Surprisingly, we\nfind that linear ICA can accurately estimate multiple treatment effects even in\nthe presence of Gaussian confounders or nonlinear nuisance."}

Existing theoretical analyses of\nRLDA often lack clear insight into how data structure affects classification\nperformance. To address this issue, we derive a non-asymptotic approximation of\nthe misclassification rate and thus analyze the structural effect and\nstructural adjustment strategies of RLDA. Based on this, we propose the\nSpectral Enhanced Discriminant Analysis (SEDA) algorithm, which optimizes the\ndata structure by adjusting the spiked eigenvalues of the population covariance\nmatrix. By developing a new theoretical result on eigenvectors in random matrix\ntheory, we derive an asymptotic approximation on the misclassification rate of\nSEDA. The bias correction algorithm and parameter selection strategy are then\nobtained. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that SEDA achieves\nhigher classification accuracy and dimensionality reduction compared to\nexisting LDA methods."}
