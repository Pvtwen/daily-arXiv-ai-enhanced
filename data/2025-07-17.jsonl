Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off among\naccuracy, computational cost, and the need for prior information such as the\nnumber of modes. This paper introduces time-frequency mode decomposition\n(TFMD), a novel framework for the fast, robust, and adaptive decomposition of\nsuch signals. TFMD operates on the principle that modes form contiguous\nhigh-energy regions in the time-frequency domain. Its non-iterative pipeline\nreframes signal decomposition as an image segmentation task: a signal is\ntransformed into a spectrogram, which is then smoothed to enhance the\ncontinuity of these high-energy regions. A sequence of adaptive thresholding\nand connected-component labeling with size-based filtering is then employed to\nautomatically segment the spectrogram and generate a mask for each mode. The\nmodes are finally reconstructed via the inverse short-time Fourier transform.\nValidation on diverse synthetic signals demonstrates that TFMD accurately\ndetermines the number of modes and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Its\nperformance is particularly strong in high-noise conditions. A comparative\nanalysis confirms that TFMD provides robust, competitive performance across a\nwider variety of signal types, while a theoretical complexity analysis reveals\nits superior computational efficiency stemming from its non-iterative design.\nThe method's practical utility is further demonstrated by successfully\nextracting modal responses from a real-world footbridge vibration signal. TFMD\nprovides a computationally efficient and powerful paradigm for multicomponent\nsignal analysis, offering a compelling balance of accuracy, versatility, and\nefficiency for large-scale or time-sensitive applications."}

The\npremise of our study is twofold: firstly, the further two states are from each\nother, transition-wise, the less relevant the value of the first state is when\nlearning the $\\epsilon$-optimal value of the second; secondly, the amount of\n'effort', sample-complexity-wise, expended in learning the $\\epsilon$-optimal\nvalue of a state is independent of the number of samples required to learn the\n$\\epsilon$-optimal value of a second state that is a sufficient number of\ntransitions away from the first. Inversely, states within each other's vicinity\nhave values that are dependent on each other and will require a similar number\nof samples to learn. By approximating the original MDP using smaller MDPs\nconstructed using subsets of the original's state-space, we are able to reduce\nthe sample-complexity by a logarithmic factor to $O(SA \\log A)$ timesteps,\nwhere $S$ and $A$ are the state and action space sizes. We are able to extend\nthese results to an infinite-horizon, model-free setting by constructing a\nPAC-MDP algorithm with the aforementioned sample-complexity. We conclude with\nshowing how significant the improvement is by comparing our algorithm against\nprior work in an experimental setting."}

Tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost excel in\ninterpretability and accuracy for tabular data, but scaling them remains\ncomputationally expensive due to poor data locality and high data dependence.\nPrevious efforts to accelerate these models with analog content addressable\nmemory (CAM) have struggled, due to the fact that the difficult-to-implement\nsharp decision boundaries are highly susceptible to device variations, which\nleads to poor hardware performance and vulnerability to adversarial attacks.\nThis work presents a novel hardware-software co-design approach using $MoS_2$\nFlash-based analog CAM with inherent soft boundaries, enabling efficient\ninference with soft tree-based models. Our soft tree model inference\nexperiments on $MoS_2$ analog CAM arrays show this method achieves exceptional\nrobustness against device variation and adversarial attacks while achieving\nstate-of-the-art accuracy. Specifically, our fabricated analog CAM arrays\nachieve $96\\%$ accuracy on Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) database,\nwhile maintaining decision explainability. Our experimentally calibrated model\nvalidated only a $0.6\\%$ accuracy drop on the MNIST dataset under $10\\%$ device\nthreshold variation, compared to a $45.3\\%$ drop for traditional decision\ntrees.

While many works have empirically studied\ntechniques like Best-of-N (BoN) and rejection sampling that make use of a\nverifier to enable test-time scaling, there is little theoretical understanding\nof how verifier imperfection affects performance. In this work, we address this\ngap.

As a consequence when the ROC curve is unknown, it is impossible to\nextrapolate the performance of rejection sampling based on the low-compute\nregime. Furthermore, while rejection sampling outperforms BoN for fixed\ncompute, in the infinite-compute limit both methods converge to the same level\nof accuracy, determined by the slope of the ROC curve near the origin.

We propose\nTargeted Deep Architectures (TDA), a new framework that embeds TMLE directly\ninto the network's parameter space with no restrictions on the backbone\narchitecture. Specifically, TDA partitions model parameters - freezing all but\na small \"targeting\" subset - and iteratively updates them along a targeting\ngradient, derived from projecting the influence functions onto the span of the\ngradients of the loss with respect to weights. This procedure yields plug-in\nestimates that remove first-order bias and produce asymptotically valid\nconfidence intervals. Crucially, TDA easily extends to multi-dimensional causal\nestimands (e.g., entire survival curves) by merging separate targeting\ngradients into a single universal targeting update. Theoretically, TDA inherits\nclassical TMLE properties, including double robustness and semiparametric\nefficiency. Empirically, on the benchmark IHDP dataset (average treatment\neffects) and simulated survival data with informative censoring, TDA reduces\nbias and improves coverage relative to both standard neural-network estimators\nand prior post-hoc approaches. In doing so, TDA establishes a direct, scalable\npathway toward rigorous causal inference within modern deep architectures for\ncomplex multi-parameter targets."}

However, the\nreal-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research\nprogress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of\nfirst-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,\nthis study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their\nmethodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that\nmost EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on\ntransformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for\nself-supervision.
