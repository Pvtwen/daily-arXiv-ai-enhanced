We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages\nthe Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a\nspatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with\nSDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is\nproven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,\nrevealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC\nwith efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI\nparadigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.\nThis work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and\nengineering fields."}

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent\nnon-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.\nAccurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for\npersonalizing and optimizing treatment strategies.

Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple\nmachine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause\nmortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive\nexplanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results.

AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and\ntime when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data\nneeded. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,\naiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.\nMost strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that\naffect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.\nThis work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only\nconsidering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue\nlevels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a\nKnowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available\nannotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using\ntheir past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as\ninformation about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing\nliterature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating\nannotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.\nThe results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and\nfatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,\nand the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not\nusing internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the\nproposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned.

We propose a method for active model selection, using\npredictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data\npoints that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,\nperforms consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships\nbetween classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic\nframework.

We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark\ntasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios.

As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty\nquantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over\nindicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset.
