However, this sequential design approach does not fully\naddress the trade-offs between high-frequency and LDO-induced low-frequency\nphase noise. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a co-design\nmethod for low phase-noise LC-tank VCOs powered by LDOs. It is difficult to\ncarry out the co-design using traditional manual design techniques. Hence, an\nefficient AI-driven EDA algorithm is used. To validate the proposed method, a\n5.6 GHz LC-tank VCO with an integrated LDO is designed using a 65 nm CMOS\nprocess.

Despite recent\nadvances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures\nbased on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static\ndecomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion\nmechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To\nexplicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel\nDynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch\nDecomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale\nRouting MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in\ncomponent to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with\nexponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints\nthrough input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,\ninter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed\nrepresentations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a\nmulti-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained\nrepresentations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature\nextraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically\nfuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local\nexperts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen\nreal-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for\nTSF tasks.

This corresponds to the Nyquist\nsignaling and is achieved by mounting information symbols on $BT$-dimensional\nbasis spanning the $BT$-dimensional space spaced $\\frac{1}{B}$ and\n$\\frac{1}{T}$ apart. Faster-than-Nyquist signaling involves transmitting more\nthan $BT$ informational symbols in a $BT$-dimensional space. This leads to loss\nof orthogonality. This is achieved by time and/or bandwidth expansion resulting\nfrom packing more information symbols in the same $BT$-dimensional space\n(spacing less than $\\frac{1}{B}$ and/or $\\frac{1}{T}$). In this paper, we take\na different approach to faster-than-Nyquist signaling. We propose to\nsuperimpose the information symbols on one another maintaining the original\nspacing in the Nyquist signaling. We carry this out in the delay-Doppler (DD)\ndomain using Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS)\nmodulation. In Zak-OTFS, the channel varies slowly. Further Zak-OTFS also\nallows construction of mutually unbiased bases the interference between which\nappear like Gaussian noise. The proposed scheme leverages the slow variation in\nthe DD channel to construct a precoder that mitigates the effect of the\ndoubly-spread channel. Further, in the proposed scheme we mount information\nsymbols on two mutually unbiased bases which allows superposition of\ninformation symbols. This simplifies receiver processing to detection in\nGaussian noise since each basis appears to the other as Gaussian noise. This\nreduction makes it possible to use trellis coded modulation to enhance\nbit-error performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the\nfaster-than-Nyquist signaling scheme achieves similar uncoded performance as\nthat of Nyquist signaling and with coding the performance is better than\nNyquist signaling at high signal-to-noise ratios."}

We investigate four KAN-AE variants,\neach based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,\nFourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder\n(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating\ndata across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault\nDetection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest\noverall FDR ($\\geq$92\\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top\nperformer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.\nEfficientKAN-AE reaches $\\geq$90\\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating\nrobustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger\nscales ($\\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.\nThe OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to\nmatch top KAN-AE performance. These results highlight the ability of KAN-AEs to\ncombine data efficiency with strong fault detection performance. Their use of\nstructured basis functions suggests potential for improved model transparency,\nmaking them promising candidates for deployment in data-constrained industrial\nsettings."}

At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization\nparameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed\nprecision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of\nquantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy\nimprovement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the\nbit-width selection process has received little attention. We study this\nproblem and argue that the magnitude of quantization parameters does not\nnecessarily reflect the actual contribution of the bit-width to the task\nperformance.

This advancement is underpinned by the concept\nof Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training\ndata enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed\nbreakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and\nadvanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its\npotential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for\ndecision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by\nsystematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,\nand training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data\nefficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the\nrelationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we\ninvestigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,\nensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which\ncollectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational\nchallenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of\ndistributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary\ntraining on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these\nstrategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in\nadvancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future\nresearch. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with\ncomputational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging\nscaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot\ncontrol, autonomous driving and LLM training."}

However, in domains like\nautonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we\nneed not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal\nguarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability\nguarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically\nselecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce\nPAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets\nprobably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --\nproviding the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert\ndemonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the\napprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further\ndemonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the\nreward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,\nwe prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic\nmethods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally."}

To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent\nInference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference\nto correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations,\neliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a\ndisentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the\ntrue pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address\nthe lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air\nQuality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR). AQ-SDR is the largest AQ sensor\nbenchmark to date, with readings from 23,737 LCS and reference stations across\nmultiple regions.

However, existing\nspectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal\naccuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To\novercome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed\nSpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative\nspectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the\nmulti-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both\nfine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the\nspectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning\ntasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are\ndeveloped for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and\ntransferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA)\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly\nadapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum\nsensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification\n(WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over\nstate-of-the-art methods.
