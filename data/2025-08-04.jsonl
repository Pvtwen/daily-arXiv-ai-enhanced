In this paper, we present a VLM-driven\ncontrastive learning based multimodal beam prediction framework that integrates\nmultimodal data via modality-specific encoders. To enforce cross-modal\nconsistency, we adopt a contrastive pretraining strategy to align image and\nLiDAR features in the latent space. We use location information as text prompts\nand connect it to the text encoder to introduce language modality, which\nfurther improves cross-modal consistency.

To improve an algorithm's ability to\nmitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to\ngauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only\nevaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature\nmasking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of\npartial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown\nopponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two\nkey properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to\nensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the\nperformance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors\nroughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where\nperformance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with\npartial observability as opposed to other factors. We introduce best-practice\nguidelines for empirically benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial\nobservability, as well as the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable\nBenchmarks in JAX. We characterize the types of partial observability present\nin various environments and select representative environments for our\nbenchmark. These environments include localization and mapping, visual control,\ngames, and more.

To bridge\ndomain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch\nselects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other,\nenabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels\nmay still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to\nthe noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware\nregularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to\nmitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of\nsource overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains\nof up to 12.7% in accuracy."}

In the context of complex, nonlinear\nfinite element modeling environments, this can become computationally\nchallenging-particularly for systems subjected to stochastic excitation. To\naddress this challenge, a multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with\nadaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced for efficiently propagating\nuncertainties and estimating small failure probabilities. In this approach, a\nhigh-fidelity dataset generated through stratified sampling is used to train a\ndeep learning-based metamodel, which then serves as a cost-effective and highly\ncorrelated low-fidelity model. An adaptive training scheme is proposed to\nbalance the trade-off between approximation quality and computational demand\nassociated with the development of the low-fidelity model. By integrating the\nlow-fidelity outputs with additional high-fidelity results, an unbiased\nestimate of the strata-wise failure probabilities is obtained using a\nmulti-fidelity Monte Carlo framework. The overall probability of failure is\nthen computed using the total probability theorem. Application to a full-scale\nhigh-rise steel building subjected to stochastic wind excitation demonstrates\nthat the proposed scheme can accurately estimate exceedance probability curves\nfor nonlinear responses of interest, while achieving significant computational\nsavings compared to single-fidelity variance reduction approaches."}

Denoising autoencoders\nrely on fixed-magnitude noise, limiting adaptability to diverse data\ndistributions.

We propose the\nDiffusion-Scheduled Denoising Autoencoder (DDAE), a framework that integrates\ndiffusion-based noise scheduling and contrastive learning into the encoding\nprocess to improve anomaly detection. We evaluated DDAE on 57 datasets from\nADBench.
