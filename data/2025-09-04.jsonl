To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel physical law-corrected prior Gaussian process (LC-prior GP) surrogate\nmodeling framework that effectively integrates data-driven learning with\nunderlying physical constraints to flexibly handle multi-coupled variables\ndefined on complex geometries. The proposed approach leverages proper\northogonal decomposition (POD) to parameterize high-dimensional PDE solutions\nvia their dominant modes and associated coefficients, thereby enabling\nefficient Gaussian process (GP) surrogate modeling within a reduced-dimensional\ncoefficient space. A key contribution lies in the incorporation of physical\nlaws together with a limited number of parameter samples to correct the GP\nposterior mean, thus avoiding reliance on computationally expensive numerical\nsolvers. Furthermore, interpolation functions are constructed to describe the\nmapping from the full parameter space to the physics-based correction term.\nThis mapping is subsequently backpropagated to constrain the original GP\nsurrogate, yielding a more physically consistent conditional prior. To handle\nirregular geometries, the radial basis function-finite difference (RBF-FD)\nmethod is incorporated during training set computation, with its inherent\ndifferentiation matrices providing both computational efficiency and numerical\naccuracy for physical constraint optimization. The effectiveness of the\nproposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments involving a\nreaction-diffusion model, miscible flooding models, and Navier-Stokes equations\nwith multi-physics coupling defined on irregular domains."}

In\nthis work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for\nscalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of\nreasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)\nLoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples\nacross 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired\nwith executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic\ndata generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to\nproduce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an\nagent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based\nagent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align\nwith code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad\nsuite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and\nreveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive\nanalysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,\ndifficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at\nhttps://github.com/camel-ai/loong."}

Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control\nparadigms are ``choose phase\" and ``switch\" strategies. Although the agent in\nthe choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this\nparadigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their\nanticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,\nthe switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next\npredefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a\nmore predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase\nallocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while\nothers are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep\nHierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle\nduration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the\ntotal cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions\nbased on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the\nallocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn\nmovements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our\nmodel on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of\nreal and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the\nbest performance over all datasets against baselines."}

This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large\nstructured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint\ndistribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide\nrange of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single\nmodel. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an\nepisodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query\nsubsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,\ntraining-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large\nstructured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature\ndimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,\nmissingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified\ninterface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including\ngradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation\nmodels, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The\nsuperiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,\nregression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial\nmargins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per\ntask. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0."}

While hallucinations-unintentional\nfalsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM\nknowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains\nunderexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior\nof LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical\nscenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the\nneural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal\ninterventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control\ndeceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce\nbehavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying\ntendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task\nperformance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal\noptimization.

EEG-MSAF comprises three stages: (1) automated microstate\nfeature extraction, (2) classification with machine learning (ML), and (3)\nfeature ranking using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to highlight key\nbiomarkers. We evaluate on two EEG datasets: the public Chung-Ang University\nEEG (CAUEEG) dataset and a clinical cohort from Thessaloniki Hospital. Our\nframework demonstrates strong performance and generalizability. On CAUEEG,\nEEG-MSAF-SVM achieves \\textbf{89\\% $\\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, surpassing the deep\nlearning baseline CEEDNET by \\textbf{19.3\\%}.

To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel physical law-corrected prior Gaussian process (LC-prior GP) surrogate\nmodeling framework that effectively integrates data-driven learning with\nunderlying physical constraints to flexibly handle multi-coupled variables\ndefined on complex geometries. The proposed approach leverages proper\northogonal decomposition (POD) to parameterize high-dimensional PDE solutions\nvia their dominant modes and associated coefficients, thereby enabling\nefficient Gaussian process (GP) surrogate modeling within a reduced-dimensional\ncoefficient space. A key contribution lies in the incorporation of physical\nlaws together with a limited number of parameter samples to correct the GP\nposterior mean, thus avoiding reliance on computationally expensive numerical\nsolvers. Furthermore, interpolation functions are constructed to describe the\nmapping from the full parameter space to the physics-based correction term.\nThis mapping is subsequently backpropagated to constrain the original GP\nsurrogate, yielding a more physically consistent conditional prior. To handle\nirregular geometries, the radial basis function-finite difference (RBF-FD)\nmethod is incorporated during training set computation, with its inherent\ndifferentiation matrices providing both computational efficiency and numerical\naccuracy for physical constraint optimization.
