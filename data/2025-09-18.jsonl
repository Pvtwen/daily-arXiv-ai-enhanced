Seizure detection remains challenging, as\ncurrent clinical practice relies on expert analysis of electroencephalography,\nwhich is a time-consuming process and requires specialized knowledge.\nAddressing this challenge, this paper explores automated epileptic seizure\ndetection using deep learning, focusing on personalized continual learning\nmodels that adapt to each patient's unique electroencephalography signal\nfeatures, which evolve over time. Methods: In this context, our approach\naddresses the challenge of integrating new data into existing models without\ncatastrophic forgetting, a common issue in static deep learning models. We\npropose EpiSMART, a continual learning framework for seizure detection that\nuses a size-constrained replay buffer and an informed sample selection strategy\nto incrementally adapt to patient-specific electroencephalography signals. By\nselectively retaining high-entropy and seizure-predicted samples, our method\npreserves critical past information while maintaining high performance with\nminimal memory and computational requirements. Results: Validation on the\nCHB-MIT dataset, shows that EpiSMART achieves a 21% improvement in the F1 score\nover a trained baseline without updates in all other patients. On average,\nEpiSMART requires only 6.46 minutes of labeled data and 6.28 updates per day,\nmaking it suitable for real-time deployment in wearable systems.\nConclusion:EpiSMART enables robust and personalized seizure detection under\nrealistic and resource-constrained conditions by effectively integrating new\ndata into existing models without degrading past knowledge. Significance: This\nframework advances automated seizure detection by providing a continual\nlearning approach that supports patient-specific adaptation and practical\ndeployment in wearable healthcare systems."}

This paper focuses on defending diffusion\nmodels against membership inference attacks. This type of attack occurs when\nthe attacker can determine if a certain data point was used to train the model.\nAlthough diffusion models are intrinsically more resistant to membership\ninference attacks than other generative models, they are still susceptible. The\ndefense proposed here utilizes critically-damped higher-order Langevin\ndynamics, which introduces several auxiliary variables and a joint diffusion\nprocess along these variables. The idea is that the presence of auxiliary\nvariables mixes external randomness that helps to corrupt sensitive input data\nearlier on in the diffusion process. This concept is theoretically investigated\nand validated on a toy dataset and a speech dataset using the Area Under the\nReceiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves and the FID metric."}

To address these critical\nshortcomings, we introduce NIRVANA, a novel pruning method explicitly designed\nto balance immediate zero-shot accuracy preservation with robust fine-tuning\ncapability. Leveraging a first-order saliency criterion derived from the Neural\nTangent Kernel under Adam optimization dynamics, NIRVANA provides a\ntheoretically grounded pruning strategy that respects essential model training\nbehaviors. To further address the unique challenges posed by structured\npruning, NIRVANA incorporates an adaptive sparsity allocation mechanism across\nlayers and modules (attention vs. MLP), which adjusts pruning intensity between\nmodules in a globally balanced manner. Additionally, to mitigate the high\nsensitivity of pruning decisions to calibration data quality, we propose a\nsimple yet effective KL divergence-based calibration data selection strategy,\nensuring more reliable and task-agnostic pruning outcomes. Comprehensive\nexperiments conducted on Llama3, Qwen, and T5 models demonstrate that NIRVANA\noutperforms existing structured pruning methods under equivalent sparsity\nconstraints, providing a theoretically sound and practical approach to LLM\ncompression. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/iDEA-iSAIL-Lab-UIUC/NIRVANA."}

We propose turning exploration into supervision through Compute\nas Teacher (CaT), which converts the model's own exploration at inference-time\ninto reference-free supervision by synthesizing a single reference from a group\nof parallel rollouts and then optimizing toward it. Concretely, the current\npolicy produces a group of rollouts; a frozen anchor (the initial policy)\nreconciles omissions and contradictions to estimate a reference, turning extra\ninference-time compute into a teacher signal. We turn this into rewards in two\nregimes: (i) verifiable tasks use programmatic equivalence on final answers;\n(ii) non-verifiable tasks use self-proposed rubrics-binary, auditable criteria\nscored by an independent LLM judge, with reward given by the fraction\nsatisfied. Unlike selection methods (best-of-N, majority, perplexity, or judge\nscores), synthesis may disagree with the majority and be correct even when all\nrollouts are wrong; performance scales with the number of rollouts. As a\ntest-time procedure, CaT improves Gemma 3 4B, Qwen 3 4B, and Llama 3.1 8B (up\nto +27% on MATH-500; +12% on HealthBench). With reinforcement learning\n(CaT-RL), we obtain further gains (up to +33% and +30%), with the trained\npolicy surpassing the initial teacher signal."}

Existing signal-quality\nassessment (SQA) methods rely either on brittle heuristics or on data-hungry\nsupervised models. We introduce the first fully unsupervised SQA pipeline for\nwrist PPG. Stage 1 trains a contrastive 1-D ResNet-18 on 276 h of raw,\nunlabeled data from heterogeneous sources (varying in device and sampling\nfrequency), yielding optical-emitter- and motion-invariant embeddings (i.e.,\nthe learned representation is stable across differences in LED wavelength,\ndrive intensity, and device optics, as well as wrist motion). Stage 2 converts\neach 512-D encoder embedding into a 4-D topological signature via persistent\nhomology (PH) and clusters these signatures with HDBSCAN. To produce a binary\nsignal-quality index (SQI), the acceptable PPG signals are represented by the\ndensest cluster while the remaining clusters are assumed to mainly contain\npoor-quality PPG signals. Without re-tuning, the SQI attains Silhouette,\nDavies-Bouldin, and Calinski-Harabasz scores of 0.72, 0.34, and 6173,\nrespectively, on a stratified sample of 10,000 windows.
