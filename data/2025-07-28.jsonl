In particular, letting\n$\\hat{\\lambda}_l^\\varepsilon$ denote the $l$-th eigenvalue of $\\Delta_n$, and\nunder suitable assumptions on the data generating model and on the rate of\ndecay of $\\varepsilon$, we prove that $\\sqrt{n } (\\hat{\\lambda}_{l}^\\varepsilon\n- \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{l}^\\varepsilon] )$ is asymptotically Gaussian with\na variance that we can explicitly characterize. A formal argument allows us to\ninterpret this asymptotic variance as the dissipation of a gradient flow of a\nsuitable energy with respect to the Fisher-Rao geometry. This geometric\ninterpretation allows us to give, in turn, a statistical interpretation of the\nasymptotic variance in terms of a Cramer-Rao lower bound for the estimation of\nthe eigenvalues of certain weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator. The latter\ninterpretation suggests a form of asymptotic statistical efficiency for the\neigenvalues of the graph Laplacian.

Here we propose Contrastive LEarning with\nAnti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR), an intuitive and easy-to-implement\nframework that effectively separates essential (i.e., task-relevant)\ncharacteristics from superficial (i.e., task-irrelevant) characteristics during\ntraining, leading to better performance when superficial characteristics shift\nat test time. We begin by supposing that data representations can be\nsemantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain\ninformation relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features,\nwhich encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet\nmay degrade performance due to associations with content present in training\ndata that do not generalize. We then prove that our anti-contrastive penalty,\nwhich we call Pair-Switching (PS), minimizes the Mutual Information between the\nstyle attributes and content labels. Finally, we instantiate CLEAR in the\nlatent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), then perform experiments to\nquantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the resulting CLEAR-VAE over several\nimage datasets. Our results show that CLEAR-VAE allows us to: (a) swap and\ninterpolate content and style between any pair of samples, and (b) improve\ndownstream classification performance in the presence of previously unseen\ncombinations of content and style. Our code will be made publicly available."}

We propose\na physics-informed GNN framework that systematically encodes detector geometry\nand physical observables through four distinct graph construction strategies\nthat systematically encode detector geometry and physical observables:\nstation-as-node, feature-as-node, bending angle-centric, and pseudorapidity\n($\\eta$)-centric representations. This framework integrates these tailored\ngraph structures with a novel Message Passing Layer (MPL), featuring\nintra-message attention and gated updates, and domain-specific loss functions\nincorporating $p_{T}$-distribution priors. Our co-design methodology yields\nsuperior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing baselines.\nExtensive experiments on the CMS Trigger Dataset validate the approach: a\nstation-informed EdgeConv model achieves a state-of-the-art MAE of 0.8525 with\n$\\ge55\\%$ fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, especially TabNet,\nwhile an $\\eta$-centric MPL configuration also demonstrates improved accuracy\nwith comparable efficiency. These results establish the promise of\nphysics-guided GNNs for deployment in resource-constrained trigger systems."}

In particular, letting\n$\\hat{\\lambda}_l^\\varepsilon$ denote the $l$-th eigenvalue of $\\Delta_n$, and\nunder suitable assumptions on the data generating model and on the rate of\ndecay of $\\varepsilon$, we prove that $\\sqrt{n } (\\hat{\\lambda}_{l}^\\varepsilon\n- \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{l}^\\varepsilon] )$ is asymptotically Gaussian with\na variance that we can explicitly characterize. A formal argument allows us to\ninterpret this asymptotic variance as the dissipation of a gradient flow of a\nsuitable energy with respect to the Fisher-Rao geometry. This geometric\ninterpretation allows us to give, in turn, a statistical interpretation of the\nasymptotic variance in terms of a Cramer-Rao lower bound for the estimation of\nthe eigenvalues of certain weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator. The latter\ninterpretation suggests a form of asymptotic statistical efficiency for the\neigenvalues of the graph Laplacian. We also present CLTs for multiple\neigenvalues and through several numerical experiments explore the validity of\nour results when some of the assumptions that we make in our theoretical\nanalysis are relaxed."}

While elegant\ntheories exist for accurate causal discovery given infinite data, real-world\napplications are inherently resource-constrained. Effective methods for\ninferring causal relationships from observational data must perform well under\nfinite data and time constraints, where \"performing well\" implies achieving\nhigh, though not perfect accuracy. In his seminal paper A Theory of the\nLearnable, Valiant highlighted the importance of resource constraints in\nsupervised machine learning, introducing the concept of Probably Approximately\nCorrect (PAC) learning as an alternative to exact learning. Inspired by\nValiant's work, we propose the Probably Approximately Correct Causal (PACC)\nDiscovery framework, which extends PAC learning principles to the causal field.\nThis framework emphasizes both computational and sample efficiency for\nestablished causal methods such as propensity score techniques and instrumental\nvariable approaches. Furthermore, we show that it can also provide theoretical\nguarantees for other widely used methods, such as the Self-Controlled Case\nSeries (SCCS) method, which had previously lacked such guarantees."}

The main analytical tool is the samplet transform, originally defined\nin the Euclidean framework as a discrete wavelet-like construction, tailored to\nthe analysis of scattered data. The first contribution of this work is defining\nsamplets on graphs. To this end, we subdivide the graph into a fixed number of\npatches, embed each patch into a Euclidean space, where we construct samplets,\nand eventually pull the construction back to the graph. This ensures\northogonality, locality, and the vanishing moments property with respect to\nproperly defined polynomial spaces on graphs. Compared to classical Haar\nwavelets, this framework broadens the class of graph signals that can\nefficiently be compressed and analyzed. Along this line, we provide a\ndefinition of a class of signals that can be compressed using our construction.\nWe support our findings with different examples of signals defined on graphs\nwhose vertices lie on smooth manifolds. For efficient numerical implementation,\nwe combine heavy edge clustering, to partition the graph into meaningful\npatches, with landmark \\texttt{Isomap}, which provides low-dimensional\nembeddings for each patch. Our results demonstrate the method's robustness,\nscalability, and ability to yield sparse representations with controllable\napproximation error, significantly outperforming traditional Haar wavelet\napproaches in terms of compression efficiency and multiresolution fidelity."}

In addition, all layers can be\npartitioned into groups such that the layers in the same group are embedded in\nthe same ambient subspace but otherwise matrices of connection probabilities\ncan be all different. This setting includes majority of multilayer network\nmodels as its particular cases. The key task in this model is to recover the\ngroups of layers with unique subspace structures, since the case where all\nlayers of the network are embedded in the same subspace has been fairly well\nstudied. Until now, clustering of layers in such networks was based on the\nlayer-per-layer analysis, which required the multilayer network to be\nsufficiently dense. Nevertheless, in this paper we succeeded in pooling\ninformation in all layers together and providing a tensor-based methodology\nthat ensures perfect clustering for a much sparser network. Our theoretical\nresults, established under intuitive non-restrictive assumptions, assert that\nthe new technique achieves perfect clustering under sparsity conditions that,\nup to logarithmic factors, coincide with the computational lower bound derived\nfor a much simpler model."}
