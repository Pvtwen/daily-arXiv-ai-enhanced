The high mobility of local devices\nresults in imperfect channel estimation, leading to a misalignment problem,\ni.e., the model parameters transmitted from different local devices do not\narrive at the central PS simultaneously. Moreover, the mobility introduces\ntime-varying uploading channels, which further complicates the aggregation\nprocess. All these factors collectively cause distortions in the OTA-FL\ntraining process which are underexplored. To quantify these effects, we first\nderive a closed-form expression for a single-round global model update in terms\nof these channel imperfections. We then extend our analysis to capture multiple\nrounds of global updates, yielding a bound on the accumulated error in OTA-FL.\nWe validate our theoretical results via extensive numerical simulations, which\ncorroborate our derived analysis."}

We\ndevelop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees\nfor CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is\nupper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the\nrepresentativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,\nCLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art\nmethods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally\nexpensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across\narchitectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with\n<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,\nincurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias\nreduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional\nstratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,\nefficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization."}

Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling\ncontinuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals\nfor machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The\ncurrent naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited\nbiological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.\nWe investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine\nlearning EEG analysis.\n  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that\ncreates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG\ndata and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that\ntypically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable\nsynthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG\nmethod has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying\nit to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG\nwith fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG\nmachine learning pipeline for seizure detection.\n  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure\ndetection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using\na standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and\nrequires fewer segments.\n  Significance.

Generally,\nthis problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional\ndistributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows\nexponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data\nanalysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across\ndifferent underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based\napproach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we\nintroduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of\ncredibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey\ndata in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our\nalgorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the\nfact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data\nrather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we\nshow that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the\nregression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality\nof the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and\nnumerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance."}

Project page:\n  https://sites.google.com/view/ditree", "summary": "Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free\ntrajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical\nproblem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the\nrobot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action\npropagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and\nsolution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due\nto uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield\nsignificantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,\nthus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree\n(DiTree): a \\emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion\npolicies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search\nwithin SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of\nexpert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness\nof SBPs to yield \\emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation\niterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an\nimplementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler\ntrained on a \\emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD\nscenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than\nclassical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.\nDiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other\napproaches by achieving roughly 30\\% higher success rate.

InSQuAD achieves\nthis through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a\ntargeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on\nSMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the\nnotions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in\nexisting retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking\ndiversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training\nparadigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality\nand diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To\nfurther aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question\nanswering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases.

However, aligning their output\ndistributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,\ncompositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While\nreinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL\nfrom human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to\nthese generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion\nmodels and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after\nfine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models\nthrough the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward\nconditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an\ninference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining\nthe outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically\nequivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL\nobjectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off\nwithout further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG\nconsistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various\narchitectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human\npreferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.\nFurthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby\noffering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our\napproach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing\nand controlling diffusion model alignment at inference.

We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of\nSNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization\nproblems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and\nquadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard\nlinear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized\nKaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized\nKaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under\nmild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first\nconvergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that\nSPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic\nloss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a\nfast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first\nexplanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.\nOverall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can\nshed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware\noptimization strategies."}
