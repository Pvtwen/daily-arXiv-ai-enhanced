Each smart vehicle acts as a\nmobile client, contributing to the process without uploading local data. This\nmethod leverages non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) training\ndata from different vehicles, influenced by various driving patterns and\nenvironmental conditions, which can significantly impact model convergence and\naccuracy. Although client selection can be a feasible solution for non-IID\nissues, it faces challenges related to selection metrics. Traditional metrics\nevaluate client data quality independently per round and require client\nselection after all clients complete local training, leading to resource\nwastage from unused training results. In the IoV context, where vehicles have\nlimited connectivity and computational resources, information asymmetry in\nclient selection risks clients submitting false information, potentially making\nthe selection ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel\nLong-term Client-Selection Federated Learning based on Truthful Auction\n(LCSFLA). This scheme maximizes social welfare with consideration of long-term\ndata quality using a new assessment mechanism and energy costs, and the advised\nauction mechanism with a deposit requirement incentivizes client participation\nand ensures information truthfulness.

The generated data are\nbelieved to be determined by latent variables that are not directly observable.\nTherefore, disentangling, decoupling, decomposing, causal inference, or\nperforming Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the latent variable space\nhelps uncover the independent factors that influence the attributes or features\naffecting the generated outputs, thereby enhancing the interpretability of\ngenerative models. As a generative model, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)\ncombine with variational Bayesian inference algorithms. Using VAEs, the inverse\nprocess of ICA can be equivalently framed as a variational inference process.\nIn some studies, Gaussian processes (GPs) have been introduced as priors for\neach dimension of latent variables in VAEs, structuring and separating each\ndimension from temporal or spatial perspectives, and encouraging different\ndimensions to control various attributes of the generated data. However, GPs\nimpose a significant computational burden, resulting in substantial resource\nconsumption when handling large datasets. Essentially, GPs model different\ntemporal or spatial structures through various kernel functions.

In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on\nthese IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the\nunobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network\naugmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as\na control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no\nresidual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in\ncapturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances\nthe effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and\nhidden confounders. We prove consistency of our estimator under standard\nregularity conditions, ensuring asymptotic recovery of the true peer effect.\nEmpirical results on two semi-synthetic benchmarks and a real-world dataset\ndemonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "DIG2RSI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7I-G\u53d8\u6362\u548c2SRI\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u6df7\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f30\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u540c\u4f34\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u540c\u4f34\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "DIG2RSI\u7ed3\u5408I-G\u53d8\u6362\u548c2SRI\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5904\u7406\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u540c\u4f34\u66b4\u9732\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u6b8b\u5dee\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5224\u522b\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u6df7\u6742\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "DIG2RSI\u5728\u534a\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DIG2RSI\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u6df7\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u540c\u4f34\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

These reactors will generate a large flow of information in\nthe form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non\nlinear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states.\nEnsuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly\nimportant for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable\noperation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus\non watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further\nidentifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition,\nthese approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian\nprocess and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to\nunivariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other\nlinear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled\nsystem dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems,\nadditional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and\nexplainability of predictions using real data.

It is a fundamental problem in\nagent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze\nintelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the\nprimary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents\nrepresented by population members. However, when the number of attributes\ndescribing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the\njoint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of\ndimensionality.

While static, uniform quantization applies a fixed bit-width\nto all inputs, it fails to adapt to their varying complexity. Dynamic,\ninstance-based mixed-precision quantization promises a superior\naccuracy-efficiency trade-off by allocating higher precision only when needed.\nHowever, a critical bottleneck remains: existing methods require a costly\ndequantize-to-float and requantize-to-integer cycle to change precision,\nbreaking the integer-only hardware paradigm and compromising performance gains.\nThis paper introduces Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT), a novel framework\nthat removes this bottleneck. At the core of DQT is a nested integer\nrepresentation where lower-precision values are bit-wise embedded within\nhigher-precision ones. This design, coupled with custom integer-only\narithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost\nbit-shift operation.

This\nframework automates the selection process by learning from historical\nperformance data of various acceleration techniques across different tasks.\nUnlike traditional methods that rely on random selection or expert intuition,\nour approach systematically identifies the best acceleration strategies based\non the specific characteristics of each task. We demonstrate that our\nmeta-learning framework not only streamlines the decision-making process but\nalso consistently outperforms conventional methods in terms of efficiency and\nperformance. Our results highlight the potential of inference acceleration in\ndecentralized AI systems, offering a path towards more democratic and\neconomically feasible artificial intelligence solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982LLMs\uff09\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5386\u53f2\u6027\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u52a0\u901f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u6c11\u4e3b\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Our contributions are threefold: First,\nwe propose dynamic layer selection for automatic identification of the optimal\nlayer for adaptation to each test batch. Second, we propose a mechanism that\nmerges weights from the dynamic layer to other layers, ensuring all layers\nreceive target information. Third, we propose linear layer agreement that acts\nas a gating function, preventing erroneous fine-tuning by adaptation on noisy\nbatches. We rigorously evaluate the performance of Hi-Vec in challenging\nscenarios and on multiple target datasets, proving its strong capability to\nadvance state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that Hi-Vec improves\nrobustness, addresses uncertainty, and handles limited batch sizes and\nincreased outlier rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hi-Vec\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u5408\u5e76\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5355\u7ef4\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5c42\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u7edcHi-Vec\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u6001\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u6743\u91cd\u5408\u5e76\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95e8\u63a7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Hi-Vec\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "Hi-Vec\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their\npractical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical\nover-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for\nassessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their\nmutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four\ngraph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity).\nCoupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how\nrewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and\nnode-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most\ngraph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various\nextents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of\nmitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and\nmethod. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node\nclassification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and\nperformance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These\nfindings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both\nsubstantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring,\nor rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and\nmay even harm performance.

We implement GNNev, a versatile solver for\nmessage-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions,\nsum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time.\nExtensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on two standard benchmarks (Cora and\nCiteSeer) and two real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) demonstrates its\nusability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance compared to\nexisting {exact verification} tools on sum-aggregated node classification\ntasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cbe\u786e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5GNNev\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNNs\uff09\u5bf9\u6297\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u805a\u5408\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "GNNs\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u5e38\u7528\u805a\u5408\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u6c42\u89e3\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u6536\u7d27\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u89e3\u51b3\u677e\u5f1b\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u652f\u6301sum\u3001max\u548cmean\u805a\u5408\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86GNNev\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GNNev\u4e3aGNNs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Existing research indicates that establishing the\ncausality between action and state transition will enhance an agent to reason\nhow a policy affects its future trajectory, thereby promoting directed\nexploration. However, it is challenging to measure the causality due to its\nintractability in the vast state-action space of complex scenarios. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Goal Discovery with Causal Capacity (GDCC) framework\nfor efficient environment exploration.

Recent advances in graph generative modeling\noffer a data-driven alternative, enabling synthetic connectome generation and\nreducing dependence on large neuroimaging datasets. However, current models\nface key limitations: (i) compressing the whole graph into a single latent code\n(e.g., VGAEs) blurs fine-grained local motifs; (ii) relying on rich node\nattributes rarely available in connectomes reduces reconstruction quality;\n(iii) edge-centric models emphasize topology but overlook accurate edge-weight\nprediction, harming quantitative fidelity; and (iv) computationally expensive\ndesigns (e.g., edge-conditioned convolutions) impose high memory demands,\nlimiting scalability. We propose GraphTreeGen (GTG), a subtree-centric\ngenerative framework for efficient, accurate connectome synthesis. GTG\ndecomposes each connectome into entropy-guided k-hop trees capturing\ninformative local structure, encoded by a shared GCN. A bipartite\nmessage-passing layer fuses subtree embeddings with global node features, while\na dual-branch decoder jointly predicts edge existence and weights to\nreconstruct the adjacency matrix.

However, existing methods\noften evaluate creative components individually, failing to navigate the\nexponentially large search space of possible combinations. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel framework named GenCO that integrates generative\nmodeling with multi-instance reward learning. Our unified two-stage\narchitecture first employs a generative model to efficiently produce a diverse\nset of creative combinations. This generative process is optimized with\nreinforcement learning, enabling the model to effectively explore and refine\nits selections. Next, to overcome the challenge of sparse user feedback, a\nmulti-instance learning model attributes combination-level rewards, such as\nclicks, to the individual creative elements.

In this paper, we propose a strategy to optimize\nsmall, deployable models by enhancing their capabilities through structured\nknowledge inheritance. We introduce Hereditary Knowledge Transfer (HKT), a\nbiologically inspired framework for modular and selective transfer of\ntask-relevant features from a larger, pretrained parent network to a smaller\nchild model. Unlike standard knowledge distillation, which enforces uniform\nimitation of teacher outputs, HKT draws inspiration from biological inheritance\nmechanisms - such as memory RNA transfer in planarians - to guide a multi-stage\nprocess of feature transfer. Neural network blocks are treated as functional\ncarriers, and knowledge is transmitted through three biologically motivated\ncomponents: Extraction, Transfer, and Mixture (ETM). A novel Genetic Attention\n(GA) mechanism governs the integration of inherited and native representations,\nensuring both alignment and selectivity. We evaluate HKT across diverse vision\ntasks, including optical flow (Sintel, KITTI), image classification (CIFAR-10),\nand semantic segmentation (LiTS), demonstrating that it significantly improves\nchild model performance while preserving its compactness.

Traditionally, experts propose significant features and\nevaluate them using physics equations. However, the complexity of the human\nbody and its movements makes it challenging to explicitly analyze the\nrelationships between some features and athletes' final performance. With\nadvancements in modern machine learning and statistics, data analytics methods\nhave gained increasing importance in sports analytics. In this study, we\nleverage machine learning models to analyze expert-proposed biomechanical\nfeatures from the finals of long jump competitions in the World Championships.\nThe objectives of the analysis include identifying the most important features\ncontributing to top-performing jumps and exploring the combined effects of\nthese key features. Using quantile regression, we model the relationship\nbetween the biomechanical feature set and the target variable (effective\ndistance), with a particular focus on elite-level jumps. To interpret the\nmodel, we apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) alongside Partial\nDependence Plots (PDPs) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots. The\nfindings reveal that, beyond the well-documented velocity-related features,\nspecific technical aspects also play a pivotal role. For male athletes, the\nangle of the knee of the supporting leg before take-off is identified as a key\nfactor for achieving top 10% performance in our dataset, with angles greater\nthan 169{\\deg}contributing significantly to jump performance. In contrast, for\nfemale athletes, the landing pose and approach step technique emerge as the\nmost critical features influencing top 10% performances, alongside velocity.\nThis study establishes a framework for analyzing the impact of various features\non athletic performance, with a particular emphasis on top-performing events.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u8df3\u8fdc\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u4e13\u5bb6\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7537\u5973\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6280\u672f\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9876\u7ea7\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u660e\u786e\u5206\u6790\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u3001PDP\u548cICE\u56fe\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7537\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u8d77\u8df3\u524d\u652f\u6491\u817f\u819d\u76d6\u89d2\u5ea6\uff08>169\u00b0\uff09\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u7740\u9646\u59ff\u52bf\u548c\u52a9\u8dd1\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u9876\u7ea7\u8868\u73b0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002"}}

However, regular graph machine learning\nmethods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental\nlearning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new\nknowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the\npreviously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to\nmaintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however,\ndo not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different\ntimestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns\ncan be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the\nnew data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic\nmixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a\nDyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming\ndata blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data\nsequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve\nold tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the\nnumber of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases.
