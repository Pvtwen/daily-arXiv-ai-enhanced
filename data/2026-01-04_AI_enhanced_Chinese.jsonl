Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Li-ion batteries is crucial for ensuring their reliability, safety, and cost-effectiveness in battery-powered systems. The materials used for the battery cathodes and their designs play a significant role in determining the degradation rates and RUL, as they lead to distinct electrochemical reactions. Unfortunately, RUL prediction models often overlook the cathode materials and designs to simplify the model-building process, ignoring the effects of these electrochemical reactions. Other reasons are that specifications related to battery materials may not always be readily available, and a battery might consist of a mix of different materials. As a result, the predictive models that are developed often lack generalizability. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel material-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for predicting the RUL of batteries, specifically addressing the complexities associated with heterogeneous battery chemistries. The MoE is integrated into a probabilistic framework, called Multiple Non-crossing Quantile Mixture-of-Experts for Probabilistic Prediction (RUL-QMoE), which accommodates battery operational conditions and enables uncertainty quantification. The RUL-QMoE model integrates specialized expert networks for five battery types: LFP, NCA, NMC, LCO, and NMC-LCO, within a gating mechanism that dynamically assigns relevance based on the battery's input features. Furthermore, by leveraging non-crossing quantile regression, the proposed RUL-QMoE produces coherent and interpretable predictive distributions of the battery's RUL, enabling robust uncertainty quantification in the battery's RUL prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578bRUL-QMoE\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u5269\u4f59\u4f7f\u7528\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u9634\u6781\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u7535\u6c60\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RUL\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u7535\u6c60\u9634\u6781\u6750\u6599\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6750\u6599\u89c4\u683c\u4e0d\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u6216\u7535\u6c60\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u6df7\u5408\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u8d28\u7535\u6c60\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRUL-QMoE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u3002\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u4e2a\u7535\u6c60\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\uff08LFP\u3001NCA\u3001NMC\u3001LCO\u3001NMC-LCO\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u4ea4\u53c9\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "RUL-QMoE\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u8d28\u7535\u6c60\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u6027\u7684RUL\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5ffd\u7565\u6750\u6599\u7279\u6027\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6750\u6599\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7535\u6c60RUL\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6750\u6599\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u6c60\u5065\u5eb7\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We propose a novel entropy-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach where each non-terrestrial base station (NTBS) independently computes its beamforming vector using a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to capture long-range dependencies in the frequency domain. To ensure scalability and robustness, the proposed framework integrates transfer learning based on a conjugate prior mechanism and a low-rank decomposition (LRD) technique, thus enabling efficient support for large-scale user deployments and aerial layers. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over baseline schemes including WMMSE, ZF, MRT, CNN-based DRL, and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method in terms of average sum rate, robustness to CSI imperfection, user mobility, and scalability across varying network sizes and user densities.

While Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and continental-scale services such as the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) provide dense observations of past motion, predicting the next observation remains challenging due to the superposition of long-term trends, seasonal cycles, and occasional abrupt discontinuities (e.g., co-seismic steps), together with strong spatial heterogeneity. In this study we propose a multimodal patch-based Transformer for single-step, fixed-interval next-epoch nowcasting of displacement maps from EGMS time series (resampled to a 64x64 grid over 100 km x 100 km tiles).

In this letter, we investigate the MA-enhanced wide beam coverage over multiple subregions in the spatial domain. Specifically, we aim to maximize the minimum beam gain over the desired subregions by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and antenna position vector (APV). Although this problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve it by leveraging the similarity between the considered multi-region coverage and classical multi-notch filter (MNF) design. In particular, we construct a spatial MNF-based transmit beamforming vector by assuming a continuous amplitude and phase-shift profile within the antenna movement region. Based on this continuous profile, we propose a sequential update algorithm to select an optimal subset of MA positions for multi-region coverage, jointly with a Gibbs sampling (GS) procedure to avoid undesired local optimum.

As a result, these are susceptible to the failure of even a single sensor. Contrarily, two-fold redundant sparse arrays (TFRSAs) and robust minimum redundancy arrays (RMRAs) ensure robustness against single-sensor failures due to their inherent redundancy in their coarrays. At present, optimal RMRA configurations are known only for arrays with sensor counts N=6 to N=10. To this end, this paper proposes two objectives: (i) developing a systematic algorithm to discover optimal RMRAs for N>10, and (ii) obtaining a new family of near-/sub-optimal RMRA that can be completely specified using closed-form expressions (CFEs). We solve the combinatorial optimization problem of finding RMRAs using an exhaustive search technique implemented in MATLAB. Optimal RMRAs for N = 11 to 14 were successfully found and near/sub-optimal arrays for N = 15 to 20 were determined using the proposed technique. As a byproduct of the exhaustive search, a large catalogue of valid near- and sub-optimal RMRAs was also obtained. In the second stage, CFEs for a new TFRSA were obtained by applying pattern mining and algebraic generalizations to the arrays obtained through exhaustive search. The proposed family enjoys CFEs for sensor positions, available aperture, and achievable degrees of freedom (DOFs). The CFEs have been thoroughly validated using MATLAB and are found to be valid for $N\\geq8$. Hence, it can be concluded that the novelty of this work is two-fold: extending the catalogue of known optimal RMRAs and formulating a sub-optimal RMRA that abides by CFEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bfb\u627eN>10\u7684\u6700\u4f18RMRAs\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u8fd1\u4f18/\u6b21\u4f18RMRA\u65cf\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u4f18RMRAs\u76ee\u5f55\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u9635\u5217\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u7a00\u758f\u9635\u5217\u867d\u7136\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5355\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u654f\u611f\u3002\u73b0\u6709TFRSAs\u548cRMRAs\u867d\u80fd\u62b5\u6297\u5355\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u4f18RMRA\u914d\u7f6e\u4ec5\u77e5N=6\u523010\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bfb\u627eN>10\u7684\u6700\u4f18RMRAs\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u8fd1\u4f18/\u6b21\u4f18RMRA\u65cf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MATLAB\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a77\u4e3e\u641c\u7d22\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5bfb\u627eRMRAs\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5f0f\u6316\u6398\u548c\u4ee3\u6570\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5bf9\u641c\u7d22\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u9635\u5217\u5e94\u7528\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u627e\u5230N=11\u523014\u7684\u6700\u4f18RMRAs\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86N=15\u523020\u7684\u8fd1\u4f18/\u6b21\u4f18\u9635\u5217\u3002\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u6709\u6548\u8fd1\u4f18\u548c\u6b21\u4f18RMRAs\u76ee\u5f55\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u65b0TFRSA\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eN\u22658\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u5b54\u5f84\u548c\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8d21\u732e\u53cc\u91cd\uff1a\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u4f18RMRAs\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9075\u5faa\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7684\u6b21\u4f18RMRA\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u7a00\u758f\u9635\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002"}}

This requirement is challenging because enlarging the hypothesis class can worsen completeness. We show that the need for this assumption stems from a fundamental norm mismatch: the Bellman operator is gamma-contractive under the stationary distribution of the target policy, whereas FQE minimizes Bellman error under the behavior distribution. We propose a simple fix: reweight each regression step using an estimate of the stationary density ratio, thereby aligning FQE with the norm in which the Bellman operator contracts. This enables strong evaluation guarantees in the absence of realizability or Bellman completeness, avoiding the geometric error blow-up of standard FQE in this setting while maintaining the practicality of regression-based evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684FQE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u56de\u5f52\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6FQE\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u5047\u8bbe\u7c7b\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0b\u5c01\u95ed\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u6269\u5927\u5047\u8bbe\u7c7b\u53ef\u80fd\u6076\u5316\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u3002\u95ee\u9898\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u8303\u6570\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1a\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5e73\u7a33\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u662f\u03b3-\u6536\u7f29\u7684\uff0c\u800cFQE\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u4fee\u6b63\uff1a\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56de\u5f52\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u7a33\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u4f7fFQE\u4e0e\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u7b97\u5b50\u6536\u7f29\u7684\u8303\u6570\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u5f52\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u6216\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6807\u51c6FQE\u5728\u6b64\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8bef\u5dee\u653e\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u56de\u5f52\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u6807\u51c6FQE\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u5bbd\u677e\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

The relevance of gaming, which generates large amounts of market revenue, drove research in modeling network devices' behavior to evaluate bandwidth consumption, predict and sustain high loads, and detect malicious activity. In this context, process mining appears promising due to its ability to combine data-driven analyses with model-based insights. In this paper, we propose a process mining-based method that analyzes gaming network traffic, allowing: unsupervised characterization of different states from gaming network data; encoding such states through process mining into interpretable Petri nets; and classification of gaming network traffic data to identify different video games being played. We apply the method to the UPSIDE case study, involving gaming network data of several devices interacting with two video games: Clash Royale and Rocket League. Results demonstrate that the gaming network behavior can be effectively and interpretably modeled through states represented as Petri nets with sufficient coherence (94.02% inter-device similarity) and specificity (174.99% inter-state separation) while maintaining a good classification accuracy of the two different video games (73.84% AUC).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6e38\u620f\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91caPetri\u7f51\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u5206\u7c7b", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6e38\u620f\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u5907\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e26\u5bbd\u6d88\u8017\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610f\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6d1e\u5bdf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u6b64\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\uff1a1) \u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5730\u4ece\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u540c\u72b6\u6001\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684Petri\u7f51\uff1b3) \u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "result": "\u5728UPSIDE\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u4e0eClash Royale\u548cRocket League\u4e24\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7Petri\u7f51\u8868\u793a\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff08\u8bbe\u5907\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea694.02%\uff09\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff08\u72b6\u6001\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6174.99%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08AUC 73.84%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6e38\u620f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Comprehensive experimental validation in application-specific settings is deferred to a companion experimental study", "summary": "Learning systems deployed in nonstationary and safety-critical environments often suffer from instability, slow convergence, or brittle adaptation when learning dynamics evolve over time. While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u5dee-\u566a\u58f0-\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bef\u5dee\u6f14\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u6301\u7eed\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\u3001\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u5f02\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u91cd\u590d\u65b9\u5411\u6fc0\u52b1\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u68af\u5ea6\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u4fe1\u53f7\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\u6216\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bca\u65ad\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bef\u5dee\u6f14\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e09\u4e2a\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u635f\u5931\u6216\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u8bef\u5dee\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5728\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6709\u754c\u6709\u6548\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6f14\u5458-\u6279\u8bc4\u5bb6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u56fe\u793a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u6839\u636e\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u8bef\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u8282\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u8bef\u5dee\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u9996\u8981\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\u548c\u8106\u5f31\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This identity can be seen as an analog of Tweedie's identity for the energy score, and allows for several interesting applications; for example, score estimation, noise distribution parameter estimation, as well as using energy score models in the context of \"traditional\" diffusion model samplers with a wider array of noising distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Tweedie\u516c\u5f0f\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u692d\u5706\u5206\u5e03\uff09\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u540e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u8fde\u63a5\u80fd\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u8def\u5f84\u5bfc\u6570\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u8fb9\u7f18\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTweedie\u516c\u5f0f\u4e3b\u8981\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u692d\u5706\u5206\u5e03\uff09\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06Tweedie\u516c\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u692d\u5706\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff1b2. \u5c06\u53bb\u566a\u540e\u9a8c\u89c6\u4e3a\u80fd\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff1b3. \u63a8\u5bfc\u8fde\u63a5\u80fd\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u8def\u5f84\u5bfc\u6570\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u8fb9\u7f18\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\uff1b4. \u5c06\u8be5\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u89c6\u4e3a\u80fd\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u7248\u672c\u7684Tweedie\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u8fb9\u7f18\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u5206\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u8be5\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\uff1a1. \u8bc4\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b2. \u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b3. \u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5c06Tweedie\u516c\u5f0f\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Like traditional software, DL systems are also prone to faults, whose malfunctioning may expose users to significant risks. Consequently, numerous approaches have been proposed to address these issues. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art DL model fixing approaches, spanning model-level, layer-level, and neuron-level categories, to comprehensively evaluate their performance. We assess not only their fixing effectiveness (their primary purpose) but also their impact on other critical properties, such as robustness, fairness, and backward compatibility. To ensure comprehensive and fair evaluation, we employ a diverse set of datasets, model architectures, and application domains within a uniform experimental setup for experimentation. We summarize several key findings with implications for both industry and academia. For example, model-level approaches demonstrate superior fixing effectiveness compared to others. No single approach can achieve the best fixing performance while improving accuracy and maintaining all other properties. Thus, academia should prioritize research on mitigating these side effects.

This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $\u03bb$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories.

In the entropy-regularized setting, we show that the soft Bellman operator is locally contractive in the stationary norm of the soft-optimal policy, rather than in the behavior norm used by standard FQI. This geometric mismatch explains the instability of soft Q-iteration with function approximation in the absence of Bellman completeness. To restore contraction, we introduce stationary-reweighted soft FQI, which reweights each regression update using the stationary distribution of the current policy. We prove local linear convergence under function approximation with geometrically damped weight-estimation errors, assuming approximate realizability. Our analysis further suggests that global convergence may be recovered by gradually reducing the softmax temperature, and that this continuation approach can extend to the hardmax limit under a mild margin condition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8f6fFQI\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u7a33\u5206\u5e03\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6e10\u964d\u4f4e\u6e29\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfFQI\u53ca\u5176\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\uff08\u8f6fFQI\uff09\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u8f6f\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u8f6f\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5e73\u7a33\u8303\u6570\u4e0b\u662f\u5c40\u90e8\u6536\u7f29\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u884c\u4e3a\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8f6fQ\u8fed\u4ee3\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u65f6\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e73\u7a33\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u8f6fFQI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u56de\u5f52\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5e73\u7a33\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u3002\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6743\u91cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u5448\u51e0\u4f55\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6e10\u964d\u4f4e\u8f6f\u6700\u5927\u6e29\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5ef6\u7eed\u65b9\u6cd5\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u786c\u6700\u5927\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e73\u7a33\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u8f6fFQI\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6fFQI\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u6574\u56de\u5f52\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\\mathbf\u03b8$ given observed data $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors. The review closes with a discussion of open problems with an eye toward applications of uncertainty quantification for probabilistic geophysical models that may benefit from diffusion-based SBI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a8\u65ad\u79d1\u5b66\u5174\u8da3\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728SBI\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff08\u524d\u5411\u52a0\u566a\u3001\u53cd\u5411\u65f6\u95f4SDE/ODE\u3001\u6982\u7387\u6d41\u3001\u53bb\u566a\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6570\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u4f3c\u7136\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u5206\u6790\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u540e\u9a8c/\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u4ece\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\u516c\u5f0f\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u3001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u644a\u9500\u67b6\u6784\u5230\u63a8\u65ad\u65f6\u5148\u9a8c\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u8bbe\u3001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6216\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u7b49\u5e38\u89c1\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684SBI\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u6700\u540e\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u671b\u4e86\u5728\u6982\u7387\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Enabling distributed federated learning in such systems is challenging because iterative training requires frequent aggregation over inter-satellite links that are bandwidth- and energy-constrained, and the link conditions can be highly dynamic. In this work, we exploit over-the-air computation (AirComp) as an in-network aggregation primitive. However, conventional coherent AirComp relies on stringent phase alignment, which is difficult to maintain in space environments due to satellite jitter and Doppler effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose OptiVote, a robust and communication-efficient non-coherent free-space optical (FSO) AirComp framework for federated learning toward Space Data Centers. OptiVote integrates sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) with a majority-vote (MV) aggregation principle and pulse-position modulation (PPM), where each satellite conveys local gradient signs by activating orthogonal PPM time slots. The aggregation node performs MV detection via non-coherent energy accumulation, transforming phase-sensitive field superposition into phase-agnostic optical intensity combining, thereby eliminating the need for precise phase synchronization and improving resilience under dynamic impairments. To mitigate aggregation bias induced by heterogeneous FSO channels, we further develop an importance-aware, channel state information (CSI)-free dynamic power control scheme that balances received energies without additional signaling. We provide theoretical analysis by characterizing the aggregate error probability under statistical FSO channels and establishing convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "OptiVote\uff1a\u9762\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u5149\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7SGD\u4e0e\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u5408PPM\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u635f\u4f24\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de8\u578b\u661f\u5ea7\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u90e8\u7f72\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u957f\u671f\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u536b\u661f\u95f4\u94fe\u8def\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u5e72\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOptiVote\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u7b26\u53f7SGD\u4e0e\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u805a\u5408\u539f\u5219\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u536b\u661f\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6b63\u4ea4PPM\u65f6\u9699\u4f20\u8f93\u672c\u5730\u68af\u5ea6\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u8282\u70b9\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u80fd\u91cf\u79ef\u7d2f\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u65e0\u9700CSI\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5f02\u6784FSO\u4fe1\u9053\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u805a\u5408\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1FSO\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u805a\u5408\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u975e\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u76f8\u4f4d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u573a\u53e0\u52a0\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f4d\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5149\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "OptiVote\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4fe1\u9053\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

In high dimensions, this leads to a fundamental inefficiency: the vast majority of the integration domain consists of low-density ``void'' regions where the target velocity fields are often chaotic or ill-defined. In this paper, we propose {$\u03b3$-Flow Matching ($\u03b3$-FM)}, a density-weighted variant that aligns the regression geometry with the underlying probability flow. While density weighting is desirable, naive implementations would require evaluating the intractable target density. We circumvent this by introducing a Dynamic Density-Weighting strategy that estimates the \\emph{target} density directly from training particles. This approach allows us to dynamically downweight the regression loss in void regions without compromising the simulation-free nature of FM. Theoretically, we establish that $\u03b3$-FM minimizes the transport cost on a statistical manifold endowed with the $\u03b3$-Stein metric. Spectral analysis further suggests that this geometry induces an implicit Sobolev regularization, effectively damping high-frequency oscillations in void regions.

Shaping their power spectral density (PSD) is imperative in the increasingly overcrowded spectrum to benefit from the cognitive radio (CR) paradigm. However, since the available spectrum is non-contiguous and its occupancy changes with time, the spectral shaping solution has to be dynamically adapted. This work proposes a framework that allows using a reduced set of preoptimized pulses to shape the spectrum of OFDM signals, irrespective of its spectral width and location, by means of simple transformations. The employed pulses combine active interference cancellation (AIC) and adaptive symbol transition (AST) terms in a transparent way to the receiver. They can be easily adapted online by the communication device to changes in the location or width of the transmission band, which contrasts with existing methods of the same type that require solving NP-hard optimization problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u8c31\u6574\u5f62\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u4f18\u5316\u8109\u51b2\u7ec4\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u53d8\u6362\u6765\u9002\u5e94OFDM\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u6c42\u89e3NP-hard\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e9\u5f62\u8109\u51b2OFDM\u4fe1\u53f7\u9891\u8c31\u9650\u5236\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u4e14\u65f6\u53d8\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u9891\u8c31\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7ebf\u6c42\u89e3NP-hard\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3b\u52a8\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664(AIC)\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b26\u53f7\u8f6c\u6362(AST)\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u53d8\u6362\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u8c31\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5bf9\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u900f\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u4f20\u8f93\u9891\u5e26\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u540c\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86NP-hard\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aOFDM\u4fe1\u53f7\u9891\u8c31\u6574\u5f62\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u8c31\u63a5\u5165\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

We investigate whether this geometric signature persists in production-grade language models. Across Pythia, Phi-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, we find that last-layer value representations organize along a single dominant axis whose position strongly correlates with predictive entropy, and that domain-restricted prompts collapse this structure into the same low-dimensional manifolds observed in synthetic settings.\n  To probe the role of this geometry, we perform targeted interventions on the entropy-aligned axis of Pythia-410M during in-context learning. Removing or perturbing this axis selectively disrupts the local uncertainty geometry, whereas matched random-axis interventions leave it intact. However, these single-layer manipulations do not produce proportionally specific degradation in Bayesian-like behavior, indicating that the geometry is a privileged readout of uncertainty rather than a singular computational bottleneck. Taken together, our results show that modern language models preserve the geometric substrate that enables Bayesian inference in wind tunnels, and organize their approximate Bayesian updates along this substrate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u4ef7\u503c\u8868\u793a\u6cbf\u5355\u4e00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8f74\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u8be5\u8f74\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u5355\u5c42\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u7834\u574f\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\u4f46\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4fdd\u7559\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\"\u98ce\u6d1e\"\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u652f\u6301\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u4f4e\u7ef4\u4ef7\u503c\u6d41\u5f62\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u6b63\u4ea4\u952e\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5728Pythia\u3001Phi-2\u3001Llama-3\u548cMistral\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u4ef7\u503c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5bf9Pythia-410M\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u671f\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u6216\u6270\u52a8\u71b5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f74\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u8f74\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u8868\u793a\u6cbf\u5355\u4e00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8f74\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u9886\u57df\u9650\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u5c06\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\uff1b\u5355\u5c42\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7834\u574f\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6027\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u884c\u4e3a\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u98ce\u6d1e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u5e76\u6cbf\u6b64\u57fa\u5e95\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5176\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u7279\u6743\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bfb\u53d6\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

The transform's utility in detecting and localizing information-laden signals amidst noisy and cluttered backgrounds, and further providing measure of their information volumes, are detailed herein using Tsallis' entropy and information and related functionals. Example use cases in radio frequency communications are given, where Wigner-Ville-based detection measures can be seen to provide significant sensitivity advantage, for some shown contexts greater than 15~dB advantage, over energy-based measures and without extensive training routines. Such an advantage is particularly significant for applications which have limitations on observation resources including time/space integration pressures and transient and/or feeble signals, where Wigner-Ville-based methods would improve sensing effectiveness by multiple orders of magnitude. The potential for advancement of several such applications is discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06Wigner-Ville\u53d8\u6362\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u6d4b\u91cf\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Tsallis\u71b5\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6cdb\u51fd\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5c04\u9891\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u80fd\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\uff08\u8d85\u8fc715dB\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\uff0cWigner-Ville\u53d8\u6362\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u6d4b\u91cf\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\uff08\u65f6\u95f4/\u7a7a\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u538b\u529b\u3001\u77ac\u6001/\u5fae\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u80fd\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u654f\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Tsallis\u71b5\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u6cdb\u51fd\u6765\u5206\u6790Wigner-Ville\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u6d4b\u91cf\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5c04\u9891\u901a\u4fe1\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793aWigner-Ville\u53d8\u6362\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u5bb9\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u80fd\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "Wigner-Ville\u53d8\u6362\u5728\u5c04\u9891\u901a\u4fe1\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u80fd\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u8d85\u8fc715dB\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "Wigner-Ville\u53d8\u6362\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u6d4b\u91cf\u5de5\u5177\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6742\u4e71\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u4fe1\u53f7\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u4e2a\u76f8\u5173\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

In this work, we consider the problem of spatial graph reduction, that aims to find a smaller spatial graph (i.e., with less nodes) with the same overall structure as the initial one. In this context, performing the graph reduction while preserving the main topological features of the initial graph is particularly relevant, due to the additional spatial information. Thus, we propose a topological spatial graph coarsening approach based on a new framework that finds a trade-off between the graph reduction and the preservation of the topological characteristics. The coarsening is realized by collapsing short edges. In order to capture the topological information required to calibrate the reduction level, we adapt the construction of classical topological descriptors made for point clouds (the so-called persistent diagrams) to spatial graphs. This construction relies on the introduction of a new filtration called triangle-aware graph filtration. Our coarsening approach is parameter-free and we prove that it is equivariant under rotations, translations and scaling of the initial spatial graph. We evaluate the performances of our method on synthetic and real spatial graphs, and show that it significantly reduces the graph sizes while preserving the relevant topological information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\u7c97\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6298\u53e0\u77ed\u8fb9\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\uff08\u5982\u516c\u5171\u4ea4\u901a\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u56fe\u89c4\u6a21\u7f29\u51cf\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u7559", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u62d3\u6251\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\u7c97\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u62d3\u6251\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u6298\u53e0\u77ed\u8fb9\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u7c97\u5316\uff1b3) \u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u5e73\u79fb\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u56fe\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u76f8\u5173\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\u7b80\u5316\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7c97\u5316\u5de5\u5177"}}

The resulting evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using learned evidence. However, the Subjective-Logic framework constrains evidence to be non-negative, requiring specific activation functions whose geometric properties can induce activation-dependent learning-freeze behavior: a regime where gradients become extremely small for samples mapped into low-evidence regions. We theoretically characterize this behavior and analyze how different evidential activations influence learning dynamics. Building on this analysis, we design a general family of activation functions and corresponding evidential regularizers that provide an alternative pathway for consistent evidence updates across activation regimes.

Due to the (often substantial) improvement of the computational efficiency, they have been widely used in large-scale machine learning applications. It has been demonstrated that the so-called covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin (CCAdL) thermostat, which incorporates an additional term involving the covariance matrix of the noisy force, outperforms popular alternative methods. A moving average is used in CCAdL to estimate the covariance matrix of the noisy force, in which case the covariance matrix will converge to a constant matrix in long-time limit. Moreover, it appears in our numerical experiments that the use of a moving average could reduce the stability of the numerical integrators, thereby limiting the largest usable stepsize. In this article, we propose a modified CCAdL (i.e., mCCAdL) thermostat that uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential to numerically approximate the exact solution to the subsystem involving the additional term proposed in CCAdL. We also propose a symmetric splitting method for mCCAdL, instead of an Euler-type discretisation used in the original CCAdL thermostat. We demonstrate in our numerical experiments that the newly proposed mCCAdL thermostat achieves a substantial improvement in the numerical stability over the original CCAdL thermostat, while significantly outperforming popular alternative stochastic gradient methods in terms of the numerical accuracy for large-scale machine learning applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684CCAdL\u6052\u6e29\u5668(mCCAdL)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f29\u653e-\u5e73\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u622a\u65ad\u6cf0\u52d2\u7ea7\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6307\u6570\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u88c2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbCCAdL\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u539f\u59cbCCAdL\u6052\u6e29\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u4f30\u8ba1\u566a\u58f0\u529b\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u7528\u6b65\u957f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684CCAdL(mCCAdL)\u6052\u6e29\u5668\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u7f29\u653e-\u5e73\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u90e8\u5206\u7ed3\u5408\u622a\u65ad\u6cf0\u52d2\u7ea7\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6307\u6570\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u8fd1\u4f3cCCAdL\u4e2d\u989d\u5916\u9879\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u88c2\u65b9\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3\u539f\u59cbCCAdL\u4e2d\u7684\u6b27\u62c9\u578b\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u3002", "result": "mCCAdL\u5728\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cbCCAdL\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "mCCAdL\u6052\u6e29\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6570\u503c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u88c2\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u539f\u59cbCCAdL\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Many recent time series forecasting models leverage external sources (e.g., news and social media) to capture human factors, but these approaches incur high data dependency costs in terms of financial, computational, and practical implications. In this study, we propose HINTS, a self-supervised learning framework that extracts these latent factors endogenously from time series residuals without external data. HINTS leverages the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model as a structural inductive bias to model evolving social influence, memory, and bias patterns. The extracted human factors are integrated into a state-of-the-art backbone model as an attention map. Experimental results using nine real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that HINTS consistently improves forecasting accuracy.

We propose a Backscatter-Constrained Transmit Antenna Selection (BC-TAS) framework, a per-subcarrier selection strategy for multi-antenna illuminators operating within a Multi-Dimensional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MD-OFDM) architecture. Unlike conventional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) centric selection schemes, BC-TAS employs a multi-objective cost function that jointly maximizes desired link reliability, stabilizes the incident RF energy envelope at passive Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) sensors, and suppresses interference toward coexisting victim receivers. By exploiting the inherent sparsity of MD-OFDM, the proposed framework enables dual-envelope regulation, simultaneously reducing the transmitter Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and the Backscatter Crest Factor (BCF) observed at the tag. To enhance robustness under imperfect Channel State Information (CSI), a Kalman-based channel smoothing mechanism is incorporated to maintain selection stability in low-SNR regimes. Numerical results using IEEE 802.11be dispersive channel models and a nonlinear Rapp power amplifier demonstrate that BC-TAS achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in outage probability and significant gains in energy efficiency compared to conventional MU-MIMO baselines, while ensuring spectral mask compliance under reduced power amplifier back-off. These results establish BC-TAS as an effective illuminator-side control mechanism for enabling reliable and energy-stable sensing and communication coexistence in dense, power-constrained wireless environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBC-TAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u6df7\u5408WSN\u4e2d\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u88ab\u52a8\u80cc\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u8981\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5305\u7edc\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u6291\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6df7\u5408\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e3b\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u88ab\u52a8\u80cc\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e25\u683c\u529f\u7387\u8981\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5c04\u9891\u80fd\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u80cc\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u7ea6\u675f\u53d1\u5c04\u5929\u7ebf\u9009\u62e9\uff08BC-TAS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728MD-OFDM\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u6700\u5927\u5316\u94fe\u8def\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u88ab\u52a8SAW\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u5165\u5c04RF\u80fd\u91cf\u5305\u7edc\u3001\u6291\u5236\u5bf9\u5171\u5b58\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8eCSI\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "BC-TAS\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfMU-MIMO\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u4e2d\u65ad\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u529f\u7387\u653e\u5927\u5668\u56de\u9000\u4e0b\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u63a9\u6a21\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u80fd\u91cf\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u5171\u5b58\u3002", "conclusion": "BC-TAS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7167\u660e\u5668\u4fa7\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u529f\u7387\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u80fd\u91cf\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u5171\u5b58\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df7\u5408WSN\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u51b2\u7a81\u3002"}}

We focus on test-time filtering: a lightweight mechanism for behavior control that compares performance scores to estimated thresholds, and modifies outputs when these bounds are violated. We formalize the problem of enforcing multiple risk constraints with user-defined priorities, and introduce two efficient dynamic programming algorithms that leverage this sequential structure. The first, MULTIRISK-BASE, provides a direct finite-sample procedure for selecting thresholds, while the second, MULTIRISK, leverages data exchangeability to guarantee simultaneous control of the risks. Under mild assumptions, we show that MULTIRISK achieves nearly tight control of all constraint risks. The analysis requires an intricate iterative argument, upper bounding the risks by introducing several forms of intermediate symmetrized risk functions, and carefully lower bounding the risks by recursively counting jumps in symmetrized risk functions between appropriate risk levels. We evaluate our framework on a three-constraint Large Language Model alignment task using the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, where the goal is to maximize helpfulness subject to multiple safety constraints, and where scores are generated by a Large Language Model judge and a perplexity filter.

Such systems are often described by coupled (or more) variables, yet governing equation is typically available for one variable, while the remaining variable can be accessed only through data. This mismatch between known physics and observed data poses a fundamental challenge for existing physics-informed machine learning approaches, which generally assume either complete knowledge of the governing equations or full data availability across all variables. In this paper, we introduce MUSIC (Multitask Learning Under Sparse and Incomplete Constraints), a sparsity induced multitask neural network framework that integrates partial physical constraints with data-driven learning to recover full-dimensional solutions of coupled systems when physics-constrained and data-informed variables are mutually exclusive. MUSIC employs mesh-free (random) sampling of training data and sparsity regularization, yielding highly compressed models with improved training and evaluation efficiency. We demonstrate that MUSIC accurately learns solutions (shock wave solutions, discontinuous solutions, pattern formation solutions) to complex coupled systems under data-scarce and noisy conditions, consistently outperforming non-sparse formulations.

It manages Doppler effects by utilizing delay-Doppler (DD) domain processing. However, the relatively long OTFS frame duration could introduce considerable sensing or communication latency when radar and communication are performed separately. By operating in a dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) mode, the OTFS system performs sensing and data transmission simultaneously, thereby reducing the resulting latency. Nevertheless, the optimal OTFS DFRC signal strategy remains insufficiently explored. This paper investigates the optimal signal design for OTFS DFRC systems, focusing on pilot symbol design and data symbol power allocation. Specifically, we derive a channel capacity lower bound metric for communication that considers channel estimation errors in OTFS. For sensing, we derive an integrated sidelobe level (ISL), accounting for the randomness of the data symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. Leveraging the above metrics, we formulate an optimization problem that balances radar and communication performance, and then solve it using an alternating optimization framework. We validate the proposed signal through numerical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. Our analysis shows that OTFS DFRC enforces a deterministic pilot signal that is characterized by a concentrated peak in the DD domain, which furnishes a common structure in the DD domain facilitating sensing and channel estimation, with data multiplexed in other DD grids, thereby unifying sensing and communication within a single OTFS signal. Compared with conventional OTFS signals, the proposed OTFS DFRC signal expands the achievable sensing-communication performance region, delivering at least a 9.45 dB ISL suppression for sensing and a 4.82 dB SINR ratio gain for communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76OTFS\u53cc\u529f\u80fd\u96f7\u8fbe\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5e73\u8861\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfOTFS\u4fe1\u53f7\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "OTFS\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u65e0\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u8f83\u957f\u7684\u5e27\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5728\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u5206\u79bb\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u53cc\u529f\u80fd\u96f7\u8fbe\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u4f18OTFS DFRC\u4fe1\u53f7\u7b56\u7565\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOTFS DFRC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bfc\u9891\u7b26\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7b26\u53f7\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u8003\u8651\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8003\u8651\u6570\u636e\u7b26\u53f7\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7efc\u5408\u65c1\u74e3\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5e73\u8861\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "OTFS DFRC\u8981\u6c42\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bfc\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728DD\u57df\u5177\u6709\u96c6\u4e2d\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5171\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfOTFS\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684OTFS DFRC\u4fe1\u53f7\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81f3\u5c119.45 dB\u7684ISL\u6291\u5236\u548c4.82 dB\u7684SINR\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "OTFS DFRC\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u5355\u4e2aOTFS\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u53cc\u529f\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In our setting, an adversary may arbitrarily perturb a fraction of the collected trajectories from a high-dimensional but sparse Markov decision process, and our goal is to estimate a near optimal policy. The main challenge is that, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $N$ is smaller than the feature dimension $d$, exploiting sparsity is essential for obtaining non-vacuous guarantees but has not been systematically studied in offline RL. We analyse the problem under uniform coverage and sparse single-concentrability assumptions. While Least Square Value Iteration (LSVI), a standard approach for robust offline RL, performs well under uniform coverage, we show that integrating sparsity into LSVI is unnatural, and its analysis may break down due to overly pessimistic bonuses. To overcome this, we propose actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimator oracles, which avoid the use of pointwise pessimistic bonuses and provide the first non-vacuous guarantees for sparse offline RL under single-policy concentrability coverage. Moreover, we extend our results to the contaminated setting and show that our algorithm remains robust under strong contamination. Our results provide the first non-vacuous guarantees in high-dimensional sparse MDPs with single-policy concentrability coverage and corruption, showing that learning a near-optimal policy remains possible in regimes where traditional robust offline RL techniques may fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a00\u758f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eactor-critic\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u9c81\u68d2\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u96c6\u4e2d\u6027\u8986\u76d6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u7a00\u758f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u6536\u96c6\u5230\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u5bf9\u624b\u4efb\u610f\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a00\u758f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff08\u6837\u672c\u6570\u5c0f\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982LSVI\u5728\u5747\u5300\u8986\u76d6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u96c6\u4e2d\u6027\u8986\u76d6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eactor-critic\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u9c81\u68d2\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u70b9\u5f0f\u60b2\u89c2\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5747\u5300\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5355\u96c6\u4e2d\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6c61\u67d3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a00\u758fMDPs\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u96c6\u4e2d\u6027\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5f3a\u6c61\u67d3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u7a00\u758f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u9c81\u68d2\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Vincent Poor"], "title": "Beam-Squint-Aided Hierarchical Sensing for Integrated Sensing and Communications with Uniform Planar Arrays", "comment": null, "summary": "In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical sensing framework for wideband integrated sensing and communications with uniform planar arrays (UPAs). Leveraging the beam-squint effect inherent in wideband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, the proposed framework enables efficient two-dimensional angle estimation through a structured multi-stage sensing process. Specifically, the sensing procedure first searches over the elevation angle domain, followed by a dedicated search over the azimuth angle domain given the estimated elevation angles. In each stage, true-time-delay lines and phase shifters of the UPA are jointly configured to cover multiple grid points simultaneously across OFDM subcarriers. To enable accurate and efficient target localization, we formulate the angle estimation problem as a sparse signal recovery problem and develop a modified matching pursuit algorithm tailored to the hierarchical sensing architecture. Additionally, we design power allocation strategies that minimize total transmit power while meeting performance requirements for both sensing and communication.

A Fast Forward-Value Approach", "comment": null, "summary": "Higher-order ODE solvers have become a standard tool for accelerating diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) sampling, motivating the widespread view that first-order methods are inherently slower and that increasing discretization order is the primary path to faster generation. This paper challenges this belief and revisits acceleration from a complementary angle: beyond solver order, the placement of DPM evaluations along the reverse-time dynamics can substantially affect sampling accuracy in the low-neural function evaluation (NFE) regime.\n  We propose a novel training-free, first-order sampler whose leading discretization error has the opposite sign to that of DDIM. Algorithmically, the method approximates the forward-value evaluation via a cheap one-step lookahead predictor. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers. Overall, the results suggest that the placement of DPM evaluations provides an additional and largely independent design angle for accelerating diffusion sampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u9ad8\u9636ODE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u662f\u52a0\u901f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u9014\u5f84\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316DPM\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u5e03\u5c40\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4f4eNFE\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9636ODE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u662f\u52a0\u901f\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u5929\u751f\u8f83\u6162\u3002\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9664\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9636\u6570\u5916\uff0cDPM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u5bf9\u91c7\u6837\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u795e\u7ecf\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u4e3b\u5bfc\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0eDDIM\u7b26\u53f7\u76f8\u53cd\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u524d\u77bb\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u524d\u5411\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u80fd\u591f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u524d\u5411\u503c\u8f68\u8ff9\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u9636\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08CIFAR-10\u3001ImageNet\u3001FFHQ\u3001LSUN\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5728\u76f8\u540cNFE\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b83\u4eec\u3002", "conclusion": "DPM\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u4e3a\u52a0\u901f\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u4e14\u57fa\u672c\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u5e03\u5c40\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u9ad8\u9636\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u52a0\u901f\u9014\u5f84\u7684\u666e\u904d\u89c2\u70b9\u3002"}}

Specifically, quantized discrete values are encoded into binary sequences using the two's complement and transmitted over multiple subcarriers. At the receiver, we design a decoder that constructs a functional mapping between the superimposed digital modulation signals and the target of computational results, theoretically ensuring asymptotic error free computation with the minimal codeword length. To further mitigate the adverse effects of channel fading, we adopt a truncated inversion strategy for pre-processing. Benefiting from the unified symbol distribution after the proposed encoding, we derive the optimal linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector in closed form and propose a low complexity algorithm seeking for the optimal truncation selection. Furthermore, the inherent importance differences among the coded outputs motivate an uneven power allocation strategy across subcarriers to improve computational accuracy.

Conventional spline-based statistical methods, though effective, require repeated data transformation for each spline parameter tuning, with survival analysis computations relying on the entire dataset, posing difficulties for large datasets. Meanwhile, existing neural network-based survival analysis methods focus on accuracy but often overlook the interpretability of cumulative exposure patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce CENNSurv, a novel deep learning approach that captures dynamic risk relationships from time-dependent data. Evaluated on two diverse real-world datasets, CENNSurv revealed a multi-year lagged association between chronic environmental exposure and a critical survival outcome, as well as a critical short-term behavioral shift prior to subscription lapse. This demonstrates CENNSurv's ability to model complex temporal patterns with improved scalability.

This paper investigates a wireless powered ISAC system with target localization requirements, where users harvest energy from wireless power transfer (WPT) and then conduct ISAC transmissions in a time-division manner. In addition to energy supply, the WPT signal also contributes to target sensing, and the localization accuracy is characterized by Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) constraints. Under this setting, we formulate a max-min throughput maximization problem by jointly allocating the WPT duration, ISAC transmission time allocation, and transmit power. Due to the nonconvexity of the resulting problem, a suitable reformulation is developed by exploiting variable substitutions and the monotonicity of logarithmic functions, based on which an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithm is proposed.

We introduce a subspace clustering algorithm that replaces subspace means with a trainable prototype defined as a Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF) - a subspace that comes as close as possible to intersecting each cluster member in at least one fixed direction. Integrated in the Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) pipeline, this SVBF-LBG scheme yields improved cluster purity on synthetic, image, spectral, and video action data, while retaining the mathematical structure required for downstream analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSVBF-LBG\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8212\u4f2f\u7279\u53d8\u4f53\u6700\u4f73\u62df\u5408\u539f\u578b\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u805a\u7c7b\u7eaf\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5747\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee3\u8868\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u8868\u793a\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7c07\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u6240\u9700\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8212\u4f2f\u7279\u53d8\u4f53\u6700\u4f73\u62df\u5408(SVBF)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e0e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c07\u6210\u5458\u81f3\u5c11\u5728\u67d0\u4e2a\u56fa\u5b9a\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u76f8\u4ea4\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u5c06SVBF\u96c6\u6210\u5230Linde-Buzo-Grey(LBG)\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210SVBF-LBG\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "SVBF-LBG\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7eaf\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "SVBF-LBG\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8212\u4f2f\u7279\u53d8\u4f53\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, current mainstream HPR solutions relying on vision or radio-frequency (RF) (including WiFi, radar) still face various challenges in practical deployment, such as privacy concerns, susceptibility to occlusion, dedicated equipment and functions, and limited sensing resolution and range. 5G-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology, by merging communication and sensing functions, offers a new approach to address these challenges in contactless HPR. We propose a practical 5G-based ISAC system capable of inferring 2D HPR from uplink sounding reference signals (SRS). Specifically, rich features are extracted from multiple domains and employ an encoder to achieve unified alignment and representation in a latent space. Subsequently, low-dimensional features are fused to output the human pose state.

Model recovery (MR), which identifies governing equations from sensor data, is a key primitive for safe and explainable monitoring in mission-critical autonomous systems operating under strict latency, compute, and power constraints. However, state-of-the-art MR methods (e.g., EMILY and PINN+SR) rely on Neural ODE formulations that require iterative solvers and are difficult to accelerate efficiently on edge hardware. We present \\textbf{MERINDA} (Model Recovery in Reconfigurable Dynamic Architecture), an FPGA-accelerated MR framework designed to make physical AI practical on resource-constrained devices. MERINDA replaces expensive Neural ODE components with a hardware-friendly formulation that combines (i) GRU-based discretized dynamics, (ii) dense inverse-ODE layers, (iii) sparsity-driven dropout, and (iv) lightweight ODE solvers. The resulting computation is structured for streaming parallelism, enabling critical kernels to be fully parallelized on the FPGA. Across four benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems, MERINDA delivers substantial gains over GPU implementations: \\textbf{114$\\times$ lower energy} (434~J vs.\\ 49{,}375~J), \\textbf{28$\\times$ smaller memory footprint} (214~MB vs.\\ 6{,}118~MB), and \\textbf{1.68$\\times$ faster training}, while matching state-of-the-art model-recovery accuracy.

However, the ELAAs worked in extremely high frequency will push operation into the near-field region, where spherical wavefronts invalidate classical far-field models and alter fundamental estimation limits. The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part II) is to develop the theory of fundamental limits for near-field sensing systems in detail. In this paper (Part I), we develop a unified narrow-band near-field signal model for joint parameter sensing of moving targets using the ELAAs. Leveraging the Slepian--Bangs formulation, we derive closed-form Cram'er--Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section (RCS) under the slow-time sampling model. To obtain interpretable insights, we further establish explicit far-field and near-field approximations that reveal how the bounds scale with array aperture, target range, carrier wavelength, and coherent integration length. The resulting expressions expose the roles of self-information terms and their cross terms, clarifying when Fresnel corrections become non-negligible and providing beamformer and algorithm design guidelines for near-field sensing with ELAAs. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and their far-field and near-field approximations, demonstrating accurate agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative array sizes and target ranges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a6G\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7a84\u5e26\u8fd1\u573a\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u548cRCS\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u514b\u62c9\u7f8e-\u7f57\u754c\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9635\u5217\u5b54\u5f84\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u6781\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u5165\u8fd1\u573a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8fdc\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u6548\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7a84\u5e26\u8fd1\u573a\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Slepian-Bangs\u516c\u5f0f\u63a8\u5bfc\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u548cRCS\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u514b\u62c9\u7f8e-\u7f57\u754c\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8fdc\u573a\u548c\u8fd1\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9635\u5217\u5b54\u5f84\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u8303\u56f4\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u514b\u62c9\u7f8e-\u7f57\u754c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u4fe1\u606f\u9879\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u9879\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u83f2\u6d85\u5c14\u4fee\u6b63\u4f55\u65f6\u4e0d\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684CRB\u53ca\u5176\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u51c6\u786e\u543b\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u7684\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd1\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002"}}

Existing approaches, such as Lagrangian and projection-based methods, often either fail to ensure near-zero safety violations or sacrifice reward performance in the face of hard constraints. We propose Safety-Biased Trust Region Policy Optimisation (SB-TRPO), a new trust-region algorithm for hard-constrained RL. SB-TRPO adaptively biases policy updates towards constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement. Concretely, it performs trust-region updates using a convex combination of the natural policy gradients of cost and reward, ensuring a fixed fraction of optimal cost reduction at each step. We provide a theoretical guarantee of local progress towards safety, with reward improvement when gradients are suitably aligned.

This paper (Part II) derives fundamental estimation limits for a wide-band near-field sensing systems employing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signaling over a coherent processing interval. We establish an exact near-field wide-band signal model that captures frequency-dependent propagation, spherical-wave geometry, and the intrinsic coupling between target location and motion parameters across subcarriers and slow time. Similar as Part I using the Slepian--Bangs formulation, we derive the wide-band Fisher information matrix and the CRBs for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section, and we show how wide-band information aggregates across orthogonal subcarriers. We further develop tractable far-field and near-field approximations which provide design-level insights into the roles of bandwidth, coherent integration length, and array aperture, and clarify when wide-band effects.

In practice, acquiring high-quality labels and making decisions through trial-and-error can be expensive, time-consuming, or risky, particularly in large-scale or high-stakes settings. This dissertation studies interactive machine learning, in which the learner actively influences how information is collected or which actions are taken, using past observations to guide future interactions. We develop new algorithmic principles and establish fundamental limits for interactive learning along three dimensions: active learning with noisy data and rich model classes, sequential decision making with large action spaces, and model selection under partial feedback. Our results include the first computationally efficient active learning algorithms achieving exponential label savings without low-noise assumptions; the first efficient, general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms whose guarantees are independent of the size of the action space; and the first tight characterizations of the fundamental cost of model selection in sequential decision making. Overall, this dissertation advances the theoretical foundations of interactive learning by developing algorithms that are statistically optimal and computationally efficient, while also providing principled guidance for deploying interactive learning methods in large-scale, real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u5927\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bd5\u9519\u505a\u51b3\u7b56\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u957f\u4e14\u6709\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8ba9\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u9009\u62e9", "method": "\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a1) \u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b2) \u5927\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b3) \u90e8\u5206\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u539f\u7406\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840", "result": "1) \u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u8282\u7701\uff1b2) \u9996\u6b21\u5f00\u53d1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5927\u5c0f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b3) \u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6210\u672c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7d27\u81f4\u523b\u753b", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6307\u5bfc"}}

RL has been widely applied in various quantitative tasks. However, most methods focus on the spot and could not be directly applied to the futures market with high leverage because of 2 challenges. First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management. In stage I, ensemble Q learners are selectively updated by ensemble TD errors to improve convergence. In stage II, we filter the Q-learners based on their profitabilities and train VAEs on market states to identify the capability boundaries of the learners. In stage III, we choose from the filtered ensemble and a conservative policy, guided by trained VAEs, to maintain profitability and mitigate risk with new market states. Through extensive experiments on crypto futures in a high-frequency trading environment with high fidelity and 5x leverage, we demonstrate that FineFT outperforms 12 SOTA baselines in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving superior profitability compared to the runner-up.

Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%.

By assigning equal importance to all classes, regardless of their frequency, it promotes fairness and ensures that minority classes are not overlooked. However, directly minimizing the balanced classification loss is typically intractable, which makes the design of effective surrogate losses a central question. This paper introduces and studies two advanced surrogate loss families: Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) loss functions and Generalized Class-Aware weighted (GCA) losses. GLA losses generalize Logit-Adjusted losses, which shift logits based on class priors, to the broader general cross-entropy loss family. GCA loss functions extend the standard class-weighted losses, which scale losses inversely by class frequency, by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins and extending them to the general cross-entropy family. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of consistency for both loss families. We show that GLA losses are Bayes-consistent, but only $H$-consistent for complete (i.e., unbounded) hypothesis sets. Moreover, their $H$-consistency bounds depend inversely on the minimum class probability, scaling at least as $1/\\mathsf p_{\\min}$. In contrast, GCA losses are $H$-consistent for any hypothesis set that is bounded or complete, with $H$-consistency bounds that scale more favorably as $1/\\sqrt{\\mathsf p_{\\min}}$, offering significantly stronger theoretical guarantees in imbalanced settings. We report the results of experiments demonstrating that, empirically, both the GCA losses with calibrated class-dependent confidence margins and GLA losses can greatly outperform straightforward class-weighted losses as well as the LA losses. GLA generally performs slightly better in common benchmarks, whereas GCA exhibits a slight edge in highly imbalanced settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5bb6\u65cf\uff1a\u5e7f\u4e49\u5bf9\u6570\u8c03\u6574(GLA)\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u52a0\u6743(GCA)\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e73\u8861\u635f\u5931\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u7b49\u5bf9\u5f85\u6240\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5bb6\u65cf\uff1a1) GLA\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u5148\u9a8c\u8c03\u6574logits\u7684Logit-Adjusted\u635f\u5931\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u5bb6\u65cf\uff1b2) GCA\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7c7b\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e00\u822c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u5bb6\u65cf\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff1aGLA\u635f\u5931\u662f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5b8c\u6574\uff08\u65e0\u754c\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u96c6\u662fH\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\uff0c\u5176H\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u6700\u5c0f\u7c7b\u522b\u6982\u7387\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff1bGCA\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u4efb\u4f55\u6709\u754c\u6216\u5b8c\u6574\u5047\u8bbe\u96c6\u90fd\u662fH\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\uff0c\u5176\u8fb9\u754c\u7f29\u653e\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4e24\u79cd\u635f\u5931\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\u548cLA\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "GCA\u635f\u5931\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u800cGLA\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7565\u597d\u3002GCA\u635f\u5931\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176H\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u7f29\u653e\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u3002"}}

This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries. These elements define a research agenda for assured autonomy in safety-critical, reliability-sensitive operational domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "GenAI\u6b63\u5411\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u8d8a\u9ad8\u8d8a\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6b63\u4ece\u5bf9\u8bdd\u52a9\u624b\u8f6c\u5411\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff0c\u8d8a\u9700\u8981\u6b63\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u660e\u786e\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u80fd\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u63a7\u5236\uff1b2) \u64cd\u4f5c\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u5185\u8bc4\u4f30\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u4ece\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u62a4\u680f\u518d\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\uff0c\u8d1f\u8d23\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u6fc0\u52b1\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u76d1\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u654f\u611f\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u672a\u5efa\u6a21\u98ce\u9669\u7eb3\u5165\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u786e\u4fddGenAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

TabMixNN addresses the growing need for methods that can handle hierarchical data structures while supporting diverse outcome types including regression, classification, and multitask learning. The framework implements a modular three-stage architecture: (1) a mixed-effects encoder with variational random effects and flexible covariance structures, (2) backbone architectures including Generalized Structural Equation Models (GSEM) and spatial-temporal manifold networks, and (3) outcome-specific prediction heads supporting multiple outcome families. Key innovations include an R-style formula interface for accessibility, support for directed acyclic graph (DAG) constraints for causal structure learning, Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) kernels for spatial modeling, and comprehensive interpretability tools including SHAP values and variance decomposition. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility through applications to longitudinal data analysis, genomic prediction, and spatial-temporal modeling.

Learning-based simulators are widely used to compare algorithms, design choices, and interventions under such dynamics, yet evaluation outcomes often exhibit high variance due to random initialisation and learning stochasticity. We analyse the statistical structure of comparative evaluation in these settings and show that standard independent evaluation designs fail to exploit shared sources of randomness across alternatives. We formalise a paired seed evaluation design in which competing systems are evaluated under identical random seeds, inducing matched realisations of stochastic components and strict variance reduction whenever outcomes are positively correlated at the seed level. This yields tighter confidence intervals, higher statistical power, and effective sample size gains at fixed computational budgets. Empirically, seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, producing order-of-magnitude efficiency gains. Paired seed evaluation is weakly dominant in practice, improving statistical reliability when correlation is present and reducing to independent evaluation without loss of validity when it is not.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u914d\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u7ade\u4e89\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5171\u4eab\u6e90\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u770b\u4f3c\u968f\u673a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u968f\u673a\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u79cd\u5b50\u7684\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u6570\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff09\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u65b9\u5dee\u5f88\u5927\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u672a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6848\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u914d\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8ba9\u7ade\u4e89\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u968f\u673a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u5f53\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u79cd\u5b50\u5c42\u9762\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65f6\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u914d\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u79cd\u5b50\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u901a\u5e38\u5f88\u5927\u4e14\u4e3a\u6b63\uff0c\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u914d\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u662f\u5f31\u5360\u4f18\u7684\uff1a\u5f53\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5f53\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While established for fully supervised data, these techniques remain underexplored in weak-supervision settings such as Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification. Pconf learning utilizes only positive samples equipped with confidence scores, thereby avoiding the need for negative data. However, existing Pconf methods are ill-suited for high-dimensional regimes. This paper proposes a novel sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification. We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery.

For the privacy-only setting, we show that log loss with an MLE-style algorithm achieves near-optimal rates, in contrast to conventional wisdom. For the joint privacy-and-corruption setting, we first demonstrate that existing offline algorithms in fact provide stronger guarantees -- simultaneously in terms of corruption level and privacy parameters -- than previously known, which further yields improved bounds in the corruption-only regime.

However, the scaling parameters of DBF are too restrictive; after factoring out signs, all rank components share the same magnitude profile, resulting in performance saturation. We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. We also introduce a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to optimize MDBF.

They rely on linear recurrences to integrate information over time, enabling fast inference, parallelizable training, and control over recurrence stability. However, traditional SSMs often suffer from limited effective memory, requiring larger state sizes for improved recall. Moreover, existing SSMs struggle to capture multi-scale dependencies, which are essential for modeling complex structures in time series, images, and natural language. This paper introduces a multi-scale SSM framework that addresses these limitations by representing sequence dynamics across multiple resolution and processing each resolution with specialized state-space dynamics. By capturing both fine-grained, high-frequency patterns and coarse, global trends, MS-SSM enhances memory efficiency and long-range modeling.

Previous methods have introduced generative models such as diffusion probabilistic models and Schrodinger bridge models to conditionally generate the missing values from Gaussian noise or directly from linear interpolation results. However, as their prior is not informative to the ground-truth target, their generation process inevitably suffer increased burden and limited imputation accuracy. In this work, we present Bridge-TS, building a data-to-data generation process for generative time series imputation and exploiting the design of prior with two novel designs. Firstly, we propose expert prior, leveraging a pretrained transformer-based module as an expert to fill the missing values with a deterministic estimation, and then taking the results as the prior of ground truth target. Secondly, we explore compositional priors, utilizing several pretrained models to provide different estimation results, and then combining them in the data-to-data generation process to achieve a compositional priors-to-target imputation process. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets such as ETT, Exchange, and Weather show that Bridge-TS reaches a new record of imputation accuracy in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error, demonstrating the superiority of improving prior for generative time series imputation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bridge-TS\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5230\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63d2\u8865\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8d1f\u62c5\u589e\u52a0\u4e14\u63d2\u8865\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBridge-TS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4e13\u5bb6\u5148\u9a8c\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b2\uff09\u7ec4\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u540c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5230\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ec4\u5408\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728ETT\u3001Exchange\u3001Weather\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBridge-TS\u5728\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63d2\u8865\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u4e13\u5bb6\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\uff09\uff0cBridge-TS\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63d2\u8865\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

For code, see https://github.com/danrsm/flowNP", "summary": "Neural processes (NPs) are a class of models that learn stochastic processes directly from data and can be used for inference, sampling and conditional sampling. We introduce a new NP model based on flow matching, a generative modeling paradigm that has demonstrated strong performance on various data modalities. Following the NP training framework, the model provides amortized predictions of conditional distributions over any arbitrary points in the data. Compared to previous NP models, our model is simple to implement and can be used to sample from conditional distributions using an ODE solver, without requiring auxiliary conditioning methods. In addition, the model provides a controllable tradeoff between accuracy and running time via the number of steps in the ODE solver.

To enhance long-context extrapolation in compact models, we focus on Infini-attention, which builds a compressed memory from past segments while preserving local attention. In our work, we conduct an empirical study using 300M-parameter LLaMA models pretrained with Infini-attention. The model demonstrates training stability and outperforms the baseline in long-context retrieval. We identify the balance factor as a key part of the model performance, and we found that retrieval accuracy drops with repeated memory compressions over long sequences. Even so, Infini-attention still effectively compensates for the SLM's limited parameters. Particularly, despite performance degradation at a 16,384-token context, the Infini-attention model achieves up to 31% higher accuracy than the baseline.

In the algorithm, we evaluate the flow-based policy utilizing the instantaneous change-of-variable technique and update the policy with an online variant of flow matching developed in this paper. This online variant, termed importance sampling flow matching (ISFM), enables policy update with only samples from a user-specified sampling distribution rather than the unknown target distribution.

This study presents a comprehensive benchmark of ten deep learning architectures for short-term (1-hour ahead) GHI time series forecasting in Ho Chi Minh City, leveraging high-resolution NSRDB satellite data (2011-2020) to compare established baselines (e.g. LSTM, TCN) against emerging state-of-the-art architectures, including Transformer, Informer, iTransformer, TSMixer, and Mamba. Experimental results identify the Transformer as the superior architecture, achieving the highest predictive accuracy with an R^2 of 0.9696. The study further utilizes SHAP analysis to contrast the temporal reasoning of these architectures, revealing that Transformers exhibit a strong \"recency bias\" focused on immediate atmospheric conditions, whereas Mamba explicitly leverages 24-hour periodic dependencies to inform predictions.

We introduce Stagewise Pairwise Mixers (SPM), a structured linear operator that replaces dense matrices with a composition of sparse pairwise-mixing stages. An SPM layer implements a global linear transformation in $O(nL)$ time with $O(nL)$ parameters, where $L$ is typically constant or $log_2n$, and admits exact closed-form forward and backward computations. SPM is designed as a drop-in replacement for dense linear layers in feedforward networks, recurrent architectures, attention mechanisms, etc. We derive complete forward and backward expressions for two parameterizations: an orthogonal norm-preserving rotation-based variant and a fully general $2 \\times 2$ mixing variant. Beyond computational savings, the stagewise structure of SPM induces an explicit compositional inductive bias that constrains model capacity and improves generalization when aligned with task structure.

We propose that these physical constraints shape dynamics to function not as limitations, but as a temporal inductive bias that breeds generalization. Through a phase-space analysis of signal propagation, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry: expansive dynamics amplify noise, whereas proper dissipative dynamics compress phase space that aligns with the network's spectral bias, compelling the abstraction of invariant features. This condition can be imposed externally via input encoding, or intrinsically through the network's own temporal dynamics. Both pathways require architectures capable of temporal integration and proper constraints to decode induced invariants, whereas static architectures fail to capitalize on temporal structure. Through comprehensive evaluations across supervised classification, unsupervised reconstruction, and zero-shot reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that a critical \"transition\" regime maximizes generalization capability. These findings establish dynamical constraints as a distinct class of inductive bias, suggesting that robust AI development requires not only scaling and removing limitations, but computationally mastering the temporal characteristics that naturally promote generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u4ee3\u8c22\u9650\u5236\uff09\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u6269\u5f20\u52a8\u6001\u653e\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u800c\u8017\u6563\u52a8\u6001\u538b\u7f29\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u65f6\u95f4\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u89e3\u7801\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6ce8\u91cd\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u4ee3\u8c22\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6269\u5f20\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u8017\u6563\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u8f93\u5165\u7f16\u7801\u6216\u5185\u90e8\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u65bd\u52a0\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u65f6\u95f4\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u89e3\u7801\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e34\u754c\"\u8fc7\u6e21\"\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7279\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7a33\u5065AI\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u66f4\u9700\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u5730\u638c\u63e1\u81ea\u7136\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet, the robustness of quantized models against these attacks is little studied compared to large models. Previous defenses propose to inject calculated noise into the prediction probabilities. However, these defenses are limited since they are not incorporated during the model design and are only added as an afterthought after training. Additionally, most defense techniques are computationally expensive and often have unrealistic assumptions about the victim model that are not feasible in edge device implementations and do not apply to quantized models. In this paper, we propose DivQAT, a novel algorithm to train quantized CNNs based on Quantization Aware Training (QAT) aiming to enhance their robustness against extraction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our technique is the first to modify the quantization process to integrate a model extraction defense into the training process. Through empirical validation on benchmark vision datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique in defending against model extraction attacks without compromising model accuracy. Furthermore, combining our quantization technique with other defense mechanisms improves their effectiveness compared to traditional QAT.", "AI": {"tldr": "DivQAT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u9632\u5fa1\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5316CNN\u5bf9\u63d0\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316CNN\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u63d0\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u76d7\u7a83\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u6dfb\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9636\u6bb5\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDivQAT\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fee\u6539\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6dfb\u52a0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfQAT\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5176\u4ed6\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "DivQAT\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u9632\u5fa1\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316CNN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Traditional data science workflows assume finite datasets and require substantial reimplementation when moving from batch prototypes to streaming production systems. This gap introduces causality violations, batch boundary artifacts, and poor reproducibility of real-time failures.\n  DataFlow resolves these issues through a unified execution model based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with point-in-time idempotency: outputs at any time t depend only on a fixed-length context window preceding t. This guarantee ensures that models developed in batch mode execute identically in streaming production without code changes.

We begin by noting that classical evaluation metrics such as stress, rank-based neighborhood criteria, or Local Procrustes quantify distortions in distances or in local geometries, but do not directly assess how much information is preserved when projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. To address this limitation, we introduce the Entropy Rank Preservation Measure (ERPM), a local metric based on the Shannon entropy of the singular-value spectrum of neighborhood matrices and on the stable rank, which quantifies changes in uncertainty between the original representation and its reduced projection, providing neighborhood-level indicators and a global summary statistic. To validate the results of the metric, we compare its outcomes with the Mean Relative Rank Error (MRRE), which is distance-based, and with Local Procrustes, which is based on geometric properties, using a financial time series and a manifold commonly studied in the literature. We observe that distance-based criteria exhibit very low correlation with geometric and spectral measures, while ERPM and Local Procrustes show strong average correlation but display significant discrepancies in local regimes, leading to the conclusion that ERPM complements existing metrics by identifying neighborhoods with severe information loss, thereby enabling a more comprehensive assessment of embeddings, particularly in information-sensitive applications such as the construction of early-warning indicators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u6307\u6807ERPM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u90bb\u57df\u77e9\u9635\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u8c31\u7684\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u79e9\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u964d\u7ef4\u65f6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5d4c\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5e94\u529b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u5c40\u90e8Procrustes\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u964d\u7ef4\u65f6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u71b5\u79e9\u4fdd\u6301\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08ERPM\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u90bb\u57df\u77e9\u9635\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u8c31\u7684\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u79e9\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u539f\u59cb\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u964d\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u90bb\u57df\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u5e38\u7528\u6d41\u5f62\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8c31\u5ea6\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f88\u4f4e\uff0c\u800cERPM\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8Procrustes\u6709\u5f3a\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f46\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002ERPM\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "ERPM\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u6307\u6807\u6784\u5efa\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002"}}

Recent strides in electrocardiogram self-supervised learning (eSSL) have brightened prospects for enhancing representation learning without relying on high-quality annotations. Yet earlier eSSL methods suffer a key limitation: they focus on consistent patterns across leads and beats, overlooking the inherent differences in heartbeats rooted in cardiac conduction processes, while subtle but significant variations carry unique physiological signatures. Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations. This sequential logic, however, is often neglected when applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks. To address these gaps, we propose CLEAR-HUG, a two-stage framework designed to capture subtle variations in cardiac conduction across leads while adhering to ECG diagnostic guidelines. In the first stage, we introduce an eSSL model termed Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor (CLEAR), which captures both specific variations and general commonalities across heartbeats. Treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity, CLEAR employs a simple yet effective sparse attention mechanism to reconstruct signals without interference from other heartbeats. In the second stage, we implement a Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head (HUG) for disease diagnosis, mirroring clinical workflow. Experimental results across six tasks show a 6.84% improvement, validating the effectiveness of CLEAR-HUG.

However, existing GRL methods often rely on surrogate contrastive objectives or mutual information maximization, which typically demand complex architectures, negative sampling strategies, and sensitive hyperparameter tuning. These design choices may induce over-smoothing, over-squashing, and training instability. In this work, we propose HyperGRL, a unified framework for hyperspherical graph representation learning via adaptive neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. HyperGRL embeds nodes on a unit hypersphere through two adversarially coupled objectives: neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. The alignment objective uses the mean representation of each node's local neighborhood to construct semantically grounded, stable targets that capture shared structural and feature patterns. The uniformity objective formulates dispersion via an L2-based hyperspherical regularization, encouraging globally uniform embedding distributions while preserving discriminative information. To further stabilize training, we introduce an entropy-guided adaptive balancing mechanism that dynamically regulates the interplay between alignment and uniformity without requiring manual tuning. Extensive experiments on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction demonstrate that HyperGRL delivers superior representation quality and generalization across diverse graph structures, achieving average improvements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74% over the strongest existing methods, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness of geometrically grounded, sampling-free contrastive objectives for graph representation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyperGRL\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90bb\u5c45\u5747\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u65e0\u91c7\u6837\u5747\u5300\u6027\u4e24\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8026\u5408\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\u5d4c\u5165\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u590d\u6742\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8d1f\u91c7\u6837\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u6216\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8d1f\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "HyperGRL\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8026\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\u5d4c\u5165\u8282\u70b9\uff1a1) \u90bb\u5c45\u5747\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u7684\u5747\u503c\u8868\u793a\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff1b2) \u65e0\u91c7\u6837\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7L2\u57fa\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u5168\u5c40\u5747\u5300\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5747\u5300\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u8282\u70b9\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHyperGRL\u5728\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.49%\u30010.86%\u548c0.74%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u65e0\u91c7\u6837\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0cHyperGRL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The reasons behind this divergence remain unclear, as prior studies have largely relied on coarse accuracy metrics. We address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark that decomposes reasoning into atomic core skills such as calculation, fact retrieval, simulation, enumeration, and diagnostic, providing a concrete framework for addressing the fundamental question of what constitutes reasoning in LLMs. By isolating and measuring these core skills, the benchmark offers a more granular view of how specific cognitive abilities emerge, transfer, and sometimes collapse during post-training. Combined with analyses of low-level statistical patterns such as distributional divergence and parameter statistics, it enables a fine-grained study of how generalization evolves under SFT and RL across mathematical, scientific reasoning, and non-reasoning tasks. Our meta-probing framework tracks model behavior at different training stages and reveals that RL-tuned models maintain more stable behavioral profiles and resist collapse in reasoning skills, whereas SFT models exhibit sharper drift and overfit to surface patterns. This work provides new insights into the nature of reasoning in LLMs and points toward principles for designing training strategies that foster broad, robust generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86SFT\u548cRL\u8c03\u4f18\u5728LLM\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff1aSFT\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u529b\u7a84\u5316\u800cRL\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RL)\u8c03\u4f18\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u622a\u7136\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff1aSFT\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u529b\u7a84\u5316\uff0c\u800cRL\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u679a\u4e3e\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u7b49\u539f\u5b50\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u80fd\uff1b2. \u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b49\u4f4e\u5c42\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\uff1b3. \u5f00\u53d1\u5143\u63a2\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b4. \u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7814\u7a76SFT\u548cRL\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "result": "RL\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u62b5\u6297\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u800cSFT\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5267\u70c8\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u5e76\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9LLM\u63a8\u7406\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u672c\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

As a critical hyperparameter for DFL, the mixing matrix controls both the convergence rate and the needs of agent-to-agent communications, and has thus been studied extensively. However, existing designs mostly focused on minimizing the communication time, leaving open the minimization of per-node energy consumption that is critical for energy-constrained devices. This work addresses this gap through a theoretically-justified solution for mixing matrix design that aims at minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption until convergence, while taking into account the broadcast nature of wireless communications. Based on a novel convergence theorem that allows arbitrarily time-varying mixing matrices, we propose a multi-phase design framework that activates time-varying communication topologies under optimized budgets to trade off the per-iteration energy consumption and the convergence rate while balancing the energy consumption across nodes. Our evaluations based on real data have validated the efficacy of the proposed solution in combining the low energy consumption of sparse mixing matrices and the fast convergence of dense mixing matrices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6700\u5927\u8282\u70b9\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u65f6\u53d8\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\u5728\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\u2014\u2014\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8282\u70b9\u80fd\u8017\u3002\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5e7f\u64ad\u7279\u6027\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u80fd\u8017\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5141\u8bb8\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u53d8\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u65b0\u6536\u655b\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u65f6\u53d8\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u6743\u8861\u5355\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u80fd\u8017\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u586b\u8865\u4e86DFL\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u80fd\u8017\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u62d3\u6251\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u80fd\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose Temporal Physics-Informed AI (TPI-AI), a hybrid framework that fuses deep temporal representations with physics-inspired interaction cues. A two-layer bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) encoder learns compact embeddings from multi-step trajectory histories; we concatenate these embeddings with kinematics-, safety-, and interaction-aware features (e.g., headway, TTC, and safe-gap indicators) and train a LightGBM classifier for three-class intention recognition (No-LC, Left-LC, Right-LC). To improve minority-class reliability, we apply imbalance-aware optimization including resampling/weighting and fold-wise threshold calibration. Experiments on two large-scale drone-based datasets, highD (straight highways) and exiD (ramp-rich environments), use location-based splits and evaluate prediction horizons T = 1, 2, 3 s.

Language models typically rely on an autoregressive factorization over tokens. In contrast, our prior work proposed shifting sequential structure to the latent space through a causal Gaussian process, while using a non-autoregressive decoder. Here, we conduct a systematic ablation study of the role played by latent autoregression. We compare (i) a full GP-VAE model with autoregressive latent dynamics, (ii) a non-autoregressive ablation in which latent variables are independent, and (iii) a standard token-level autoregressive Transformer. Our results show that, within the considered regime (medium-scale corpora and short training contexts), latent autoregression induces latent trajectories that are significantly more compatible with the Gaussian-process prior and exhibit greater long-horizon stability. In contrast, removing autoregression leads to degraded latent structure and unstable long-range behavior. These findings highlight the role of latent autoregression as an effective mechanism for organizing long-range structure, while remaining complementary to token-level autoregressive modeling. They should be interpreted as an empirical analysis of representational structure rather than as a proposal for a new architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9GP-VAE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u6599\u548c\u77ed\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790GP-VAE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728token\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u4f5c\u8005\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u5e8f\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6f5c\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1a(1)\u5b8c\u6574GP-VAE\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\uff09\uff0c(2)\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6d88\u878d\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u72ec\u7acb\uff09\uff0c(3)\u6807\u51c6token\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52Transformer\u3002\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u6599\u548c\u77ed\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u79fb\u9664\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u9000\u5316\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f5c\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u662f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u957f\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e0etoken\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u4e92\u8865\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

We also demonstrate similar improvements on Logistics and Mini-grid datasets, exceeding strong baseline accuracies. We employ a few-shot learning technique and progressively extend it to a many-shot approach as our base method and demonstrate that it is possible to gain substantial improvement on top of this already competitive approach by employing an iterative process for correction and refinement. We illustrate how self-critique can significantly boost planning performance.

Project: https://tinnerhrhe.github.io/gardo_project", "summary": "Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics consistently show that GARDO mitigates reward hacking and enhances generation diversity without sacrificing sample efficiency or exploration, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "GARDO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u4ee3\u7406\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u5347\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\uff09\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u6b21\u4f18\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e2\u727a\u7272\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u53c8\u963b\u788d\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGARDO\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1a\u4ec5\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6837\u672c\u65bd\u52a0\u60e9\u7f5a\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1a\u5b9a\u671f\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3\uff09\u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u9ad8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6837\u672c\u7ed9\u4e88\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGARDO\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u6216\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GARDO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cdRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Although exact distribution-free conditional coverage is impossible with finite samples, recent work has focused on improving the conditional coverage of standard conformal procedures. Distinct from approaches that target relaxed notions of conditional coverage, we directly minimize the mean squared error of conditional coverage by refining the quantile regression components that underpin many conformal methods. Leveraging a Taylor expansion, we derive a sharp surrogate objective for quantile regression: a density-weighted pinball loss, where the weights are given by the conditional density of the conformity score evaluated at the true quantile. We propose a three-headed quantile network that estimates these weights via finite differences using auxiliary quantile levels at \\(1-\u03b1\\pm \u03b4\\), subsequently fine-tuning the central quantile by optimizing the weighted loss.

However, the cost of uncertainty sampling, the high-dimensional phase space, and multiscale stiffness pose severe challenges to both computational efficiency and error control in traditional numerical methods. These aspects are further emphasized in presence of collisions where the high-dimensional nonlocal collision integrations and conservation properties pose severe constraints. To overcome this, we present a variance-reduced Monte Carlo framework for UQ in the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau (VPL) system, in which neural network surrogates replace the multiple costly evaluations of the Landau collision term. The method couples a high-fidelity, asymptotic-preserving VPL solver with inexpensive, strongly correlated surrogates based on the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck (VPFP) and Euler--Poisson (EP) equations. For the surrogate models, we introduce a generalization of the separable physics-informed neural network (SPINN), developing a class of tensor neural networks based on an anisotropic micro-macro decomposition, to reduce velocity-moment costs, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. To further increase correlation with VPL, we calibrate the VPFP model and design an asymptotic-preserving SPINN whose small- and large-Knudsen limits recover the EP and VP systems, respectively. Numerical experiments show substantial variance reduction over standard Monte Carlo, accurate statistics with far fewer high-fidelity samples, and lower wall-clock time, while maintaining robustness to stochastic dimension.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u7684Vlasov-Poisson-Landau\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee3\u7406\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u7684Landau\u78b0\u649e\u9879\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c", "motivation": "\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u5bf9\u5fae\u89c2\u6270\u52a8\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u521a\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5305\u542b\u78b0\u649e\u9879\u65f6\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u78b0\u649e\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u5b88\u6052\u6027\u8d28\u5e26\u6765\u4e25\u91cd\u7ea6\u675f", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u6301VPL\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0e\u5ec9\u4ef7\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u7684VPFP\u548cEP\u65b9\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5fae\u5b8f\u89c2\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SPINN\u63a8\u5e7f\uff09\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u901f\u5ea6\u77e9\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u6821\u51c6VPFP\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u6301SPINN\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u548c\u5927Knudsen\u6570\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u6062\u590dEP\u548cVP\u7cfb\u7edf", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\uff0c\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6837\u672c\u83b7\u5f97\u51c6\u786e\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8026\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1"}}

The timely prediction of sepsis progression is crucial for reducing adverse outcomes through early intervention. Despite the development of numerous models for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, there remains a notable gap in approaches for the early detection of sepsis in non-ward settings. This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning algorithms designed for predicting the onset of sepsis on wearable devices by analyzing heart rate data. The architecture of these models was refined through a genetic algorithm, optimizing for performance, computational complexity, and memory requirements. Performance metrics were subsequently extracted for each model to evaluate their feasibility for implementation on wearable devices capable of accurate heart rate monitoring. The models were initially tailored for a prediction window of one hour, later extended to four hours through transfer learning. The encouraging outcomes of this study suggest the potential for wearable technology to facilitate early sepsis detection outside ICU and ward environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7387\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u8113\u6bd2\u75c7\u53d1\u4f5c", "motivation": "\u8113\u6bd2\u75c7\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u3001\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u548c\u533b\u7597\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9ICU\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u975e\u75c5\u623f\u73af\u5883\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5fc3\u7387\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u9884\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\u4e3a1\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6269\u5c55\u52304\u5c0f\u65f6", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0ICU\u548c\u75c5\u623f\u73af\u5883\u5916\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8113\u6bd2\u75c7\u68c0\u6d4b", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u5728\u975eICU\u548c\u75c5\u623f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65e9\u671f\u8113\u6bd2\u75c7\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u80fd"}}

Current research is shifting from single-signal to multi-modal collaborative approaches. However, existing multi-modal methods mostly employ fixed or empirical weights, assuming equal reliability across modalities at any given moment. Indeed, the importance of different modalities fluctuates dramatically with UAV motion scenarios, and static weighting amplifies the negative impact of degraded modalities. Furthermore, modal mismatch and weak alignment further undermine cross-scenario generalization. To this end, we propose a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme applied to a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework, named SaM2B. Specifically, SaM2B leverages lightweight cues such as environmental visual, flight posture, and geospatial data to adaptively allocate contributions across modalities at different time points through reliability-aware dynamic weight updates. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal contrastive learning, we align the \"multi-source representation beam semantics\" associated with specific beam information to a shared semantic space, thereby enhancing discriminative power and robustness under modal noise and distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world low-altitude UAV datasets show that SaM2B achieves more satisfactory results than baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSaM2B\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5931\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6216\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u523b\u90fd\u540c\u7b49\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u968f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u5267\u70c8\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u6001\u5931\u914d\u548c\u5f31\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u524a\u5f31\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSaM2B\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u98de\u884c\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce2\u675f\u4fe1\u606f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\"\u591a\u6e90\u8868\u793a\u6ce2\u675f\u8bed\u4e49\"\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u53ca\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4f4e\u7a7a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSaM2B\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "SaM2B\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5931\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent work has proposed Riemannian and geometric Gaussian approximations to adapt to this structure. Building on these ideas, we introduce the Tubular Riemannian Laplace (TRL) approximation. TRL explicitly models the posterior as a probabilistic tube that follows a low-loss valley induced by functional symmetries, using a Fisher/Gauss-Newton metric to separate prior-dominated tangential uncertainty from data-dominated transverse uncertainty. We interpret TRL as a scalable reparametrised Gaussian approximation that utilizes implicit curvature estimates to operate in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our empirical evaluation on ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) demonstrates that TRL achieves excellent calibration, matching or exceeding the reliability of Deep Ensembles (in terms of ECE) while requiring only a fraction (1/5) of the training cost.

The proposed framework learns spatial dependencies and geometric relations that text based reasoning often suffer to understand. By encoding step by step inference in the visual domain and optimizing with reinforcement based objectives, ViReLoc plans routes between two given ground images. The system also integrates contrastive learning and adaptive feature interaction to align cross view perspectives and reduce viewpoint differences. Experiments across diverse navigation and localization scenarios show consistent improvements in spatial reasoning accuracy and cross view retrieval performance.

Flexible IRL methods typically rely on machine learning but provide no guarantees for valid inference, while classical DDC approaches impose restrictive parametric specifications and often require repeated dynamic programming. We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself. We then formalize these targets, including policy values under known and counterfactual softmax policies and functionals of the normalized reward, as smooth functionals of the behavior policy and transition kernel, establish pathwise differentiability, and derive their efficient influence functions. Building on this characterization, we construct automatic debiased machine-learning estimators that allow flexible nonparametric estimation of nuisance components while achieving $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency.

Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u6ede\u540e\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027", "motivation": "\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u5305\u542b\u672a\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5e95\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784", "method": "\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u6ede\u540e\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u83b7\u5f97\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "result": "\u5728Lorenz-63\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cKuramoto-Sivashinsky\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u80fd\u3001\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6"}}

Recent work has explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as sources of prior causal knowledge, but existing approaches rely on heuristic integration that lacks theoretical grounding. We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (<10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

Rethinking Proxy-Model Practice", "comment": null, "summary": "Data teams at frontier AI companies routinely train small proxy models to make critical decisions about pretraining data recipes for full-scale training runs. However, the community has a limited understanding of whether and when conclusions drawn from small-scale experiments reliably transfer to full-scale model training. In this work, we uncover a subtle yet critical issue in the standard experimental protocol for data recipe assessment: the use of identical small-scale model training configurations across all data recipes in the name of \"fair\" comparison. We show that the experiment conclusions about data quality can flip with even minor adjustments to training hyperparameters, as the optimal training configuration is inherently data-dependent. Moreover, this fixed-configuration protocol diverges from full-scale model development pipelines, where hyperparameter optimization is a standard step. Consequently, we posit that the objective of data recipe assessment should be to identify the recipe that yields the best performance under data-specific tuning. To mitigate the high cost of hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a simple patch to the evaluation protocol: using reduced learning rates for proxy model training. We show that this approach yields relative performance that strongly correlates with that of fully tuned large-scale LLM pretraining runs. Theoretically, we prove that for random-feature models, this approach preserves the ordering of datasets according to their optimal achievable loss. Empirically, we validate this approach across 23 data recipes covering four critical dimensions of data curation, demonstrating dramatic improvements in the reliability of small-scale experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u914d\u65b9\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u6cbfAI\u516c\u53f8\u5e38\u7528\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u914d\u65b9\uff0c\u4f46\u793e\u533a\u5bf9\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u8bba\u80fd\u5426\u53ef\u9760\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\"\u516c\u5e73\"\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u53d1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "1) \u63ed\u793a\u6807\u51c6\u534f\u8bae\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u914d\u65b9\u65f6\u5e94\u5bfb\u627e\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5b9a\u8c03\u4f18\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u914d\u65b9\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u7b80\u5355\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b4) \u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5728\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6309\u6700\u4f18\u53ef\u8fbe\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b5) \u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u572823\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u914d\u65b9\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd0\u884c\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u914d\u65b9\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u914d\u65b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u5e94\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8c03\u4f18\u3002\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u8bba\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u56e2\u961f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, BPTT requires storing the history of all states in the network and then replaying them sequentially backwards in time. This computation appears extremely implausible for the brain to implement. Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) proposes an mathematically equivalent alternative where gradient information is propagated forwards in time locally alongside the regular forward pass, however it has significantly greater computational complexity than BPTT which renders it impractical for large networks. E-prop proposes an approximation of RTRL which reduces its complexity to the level of BPTT while maintaining a purely online forward update which can be implemented by an eligibility trace at each synapse. However, works on RTRL and E-prop ubiquitously investigate learning in a single layer with recurrent dynamics. However, learning in the brain spans multiple layers and consists of both hierarchal dynamics in depth as well as time. In this mathematical note, we extend the E-prop framework to handle arbitrarily deep networks, deriving a novel recursion relationship across depth which extends the eligibility traces of E-prop to deeper layers. Our results thus demonstrate an online learning algorithm can perform accurate credit assignment across both time and depth simultaneously, allowing the training of deep recurrent networks without backpropagation through time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06E-prop\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540c\u65f6\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8111\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684RTRL\u548cE-prop\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55E-prop\u6846\u67b6\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u8de8\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06E-prop\u7684\u8d44\u683c\u8ff9\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u65f6\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5373\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56BPTT\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels. The reward model then enables a group-wise reinforcement learning optimization, guaranteeing providing a theoretical guarantee for monotonic improvement within the trust region. Extensive experiments show that HUMOR empowers various VLMs with superior reasoning diversity, more reliable preference alignment, and higher overall meme quality.

However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix.

We developed a novel computational infrastructure to address the data integration challenge, reducing processing time from a projected over 100 days to 3.2 hours through byte-offset indexing architecture, a 740-fold improvement. Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches. These findings provide actionable guidance for molecular design, establish robust baselines for lipophilicity prediction using only 2D descriptors, and demonstrate that well-curated, descriptor-based ensemble models remain competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21logP\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6574\u5408\u4e09\u5927\u6570\u636e\u5e9342.6\u4e07\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b57\u8282\u504f\u79fb\u7d22\u5f15\u5b9e\u73b0740\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u5b50\u91cf\u662f\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5927\u89c4\u6a21logP\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408PubChem\u3001ChEMBL\u3001eMolecules\u4e09\u5927\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u768442.6\u4e07\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5b57\u8282\u504f\u79fb\u7d22\u5f15\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0740\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528SHAP\u5206\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5bf9\u836f\u7269\u6837\u5206\u5b50\uff0891%\uff09\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\uff089%\uff09\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e13\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548cXGBoost\uff09\u5bf9\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u6027\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6R\u00b2=0.765\uff0cRMSE=0.731\u3002\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff1a\u836f\u7269\u6837\u5206\u5b50\u5b50\u96c6RMSE=0.838\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u5206\u5b50R\u00b2=0.767\uff08\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6700\u9ad8\uff09\u3002\u5206\u5b50\u91cf\u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75282D\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7684logP\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5065\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD.

However, its performance often degrades significantly due to limited connectivity and data heterogeneity. As we move toward the next generation of wireless networks, mobility is increasingly embedded in many real-world applications. The user mobility, either natural or induced, enables clients to act as relays or bridges, thus enhancing information flow in sparse networks; however, its impact on DFL has been largely overlooked despite its potential. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of mobility in improving DFL performance. We first establish the convergence of DFL in sparse networks under user mobility and theoretically demonstrate that even random movement of a fraction of users can significantly boost performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a DFL framework that utilizes mobile users with induced mobility patterns, allowing them to exploit the knowledge of data distribution to determine their trajectories to enhance information propagation through the network. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm our theoretical findings, validate the superiority of our approach over baselines, and provide a comprehensive analysis of how various network parameters influence DFL performance in mobile networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u5bf9\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u63d0\u5347DFL\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u5bf9DFL\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u4e0b\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2dDFL\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u8bf1\u5bfc\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684DFL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u79fb\u52a8\u7528\u6237\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b3\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u90e8\u5206\u7528\u6237\u7684\u968f\u673a\u79fb\u52a8\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2dDFL\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790", "conclusion": "\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bf1\u5bfc\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684DFL\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6846\u67b6"}}

In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5d4c\u5957\u5b66\u4e60\uff08NL\uff09\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5957\u3001\u591a\u7ea7\u3001\u5e76\u884c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6d41\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3001\u81ea\u4fee\u6539\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u5bfb\u627e\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5d4c\u5957\u5b66\u4e60\uff08NL\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5957\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982Adam\u3001SGD\u7b49\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5173\u8054\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u4fee\u6539\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u4fee\u6539\u81ea\u8eab\u66f4\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u8fde\u7eed\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u63a8\u5e7f\u4f20\u7edf\u957f/\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6982\u5ff5\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u4fee\u6539\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aHope\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5d4c\u5957\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u5c42\u7ea7\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9636\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u9501\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.\n  We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees.

However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.\n  To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set.

However, this success comes at the cost of substantial computation and memory requirements, which significantly impedes their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \\times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408N:M\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u548c4\u4f4d\u6574\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728FPGA\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548LLM\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u91c7\u7528N:M\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u548c4\u4f4d\u6574\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53cd\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728CPU\u3001GPU\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49FPGA\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406", "result": "\u57284096\u00d74096\u77e9\u9635\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ed3\u54082:4\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u5b58\u50a8\u51cf\u5c114\u500d\uff0c\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f1.71\u500d\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e1.29\u500d\uff1bLLaMA-7B\u6a21\u578b\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53471.36\u500d", "conclusion": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6N:M\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FPGA\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8def\u5f84"}}

While existing literature has explored user acceptance of autonomous taxis through stated preference experiments and hypothetical scenarios, few studies have investigated actual user behavior based on operational AV services. This study addresses that gap by leveraging survey data from Wuhan, China, where Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi service operates at scale. We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \\& Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles. The model demonstrates strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices.

These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\\partial L / \\partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry. Optimization and inference are the same process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5177\u6709log-sum-exp\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u9690\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u671f\u671b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u662f\u540c\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u65ad\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u8f6f\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u539f\u578b\u7279\u5316\u3001\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u6bd4\u6216\u540e\u9a8c\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u5177\u6709log-sum-exp\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u80fd\u91cf\uff09\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6070\u597d\u7b49\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5e94\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u8d1f\u540e\u9a8c\u8d23\u4efb\uff1a\u2202L/\u2202d_j = -r_j\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u6570\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "result": "\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u9690\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u671f\u671b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8d23\u4efb\u4e0d\u662f\u9700\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9700\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u3002\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u63a8\u65ad\u5df2\u5d4c\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u4e09\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u7edf\u4e00\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6df7\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u8d23\u4efb\u5b8c\u5168\u6f5c\u5728\uff09\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08\u8d23\u4efb\u4ee5\u67e5\u8be2\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u76d1\u7763\u5c06\u8d23\u4efb\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\uff09\u3002Transformer\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u662f\u6d8c\u73b0\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5fc5\u7136\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u662f\u540c\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Du"], "title": "Unregularized Linear Convergence in Zero-Sum Game from Preference Feedback", "comment": "28 pages", "summary": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has proven effective for enhancing model capabilities, yet standard preference modeling using the Bradley-Terry model assumes transitivity, overlooking the inherent complexity of human population preferences. Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results.

In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \\textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \\textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9009\u9879\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u8d39\u9a6c\u72b6\u6001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u968f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u522b\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u727a\u7272\u534f\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u677e\u6563\u8026\u5408\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9009\u9879\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\u6240\u9700\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u5927\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8d39\u9a6c\u72b6\u6001\uff1b3) \u5b9a\u4e49\u6269\u5c55\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u56e2\u961f\u7ea7\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b4) \u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u63a8\u5bfc\u6355\u83b7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u9009\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9009\u9879\u76f8\u6bd4\u66ff\u4ee3\u9009\u9879\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u8d39\u9a6c\u72b6\u6001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u534f\u8c03\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that perturbing the data set by including more samples, instead of perturbing the model by gradient updates, provides a complementary and more fundamental characterization of transfer effects. To capture this phenomenon, we quantitatively model transfer effects using multi-task learning curves approximating the inductive performance over varying sample sizes. We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training.

Despite the progress in the field, making accurate forecasts remains challenging because real-world time series contain both global trends, local fine-grained structure, and features on multiple scales in between. Here, we present a new forecasting method, PRISM (Partitioned Representation for Iterative Sequence Modeling), that addresses this challenge through a learnable tree-based partitioning of the signal. At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting. Overall, these results demonstrate that our hierarchical approach provides a lightweight and flexible framework for forecasting multivariate time series.

Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction.

In practice, learned features are often redundant and vary across training runs and sparsity levels, which makes interpretations difficult to transfer and reuse. We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected.

Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task's data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples.

We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "DLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u548cCoT\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u4ee5\u6700\u4f18\u6b65\u6570\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u4f55\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981remasking\u6216revision\u529f\u80fd\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2drevision\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u529f\u80fd\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eDLMs\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u957f\u5ea6CoT\u80fd\u4ee5\u6700\u4f18\u987a\u5e8f\u6b65\u6570\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u4f55\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u660e\u6dfb\u52a0remasking\u6216revision\u529f\u80fd\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "DLMs\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981remasking\u6216revision\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f7f\u7528\uff1brevision\u6bd4remasking\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "DLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5728DLMs\u4e2d\u542f\u7528revision\u529f\u80fd\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "ResponseRank\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u6765\u7a33\u5065\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u5143\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7528\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRLHF\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u9009\u62e9\u53ea\u80fd\u4f20\u8fbe\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8861\u91cf\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faResponseRank\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u7a33\u5065\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6548\u7528\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1a\u5408\u6210\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u3001RL\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u56de\u5408\u56de\u62a5\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Pearson Distance Correlation\uff08PDC\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5e8f\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e2d\u5206\u79bb\u57fa\u6570\u6548\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "ResponseRank\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u7a33\u5065\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u5143\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets.

In this work, we show that this is not the case, and that both uniform attention and trainable attention architectures implement the same algorithm via topologically and geometrically equivalent representations. Our methodology goes beyond the interpretation of individual neurons and weights. Instead, we identify all of the neurons corresponding to each learned representation and then study the collective group of neurons as one entity. This method reveals that each learned representation is a manifold that we can study utilizing tools from topology. Based on this insight, we can statistically analyze the learned representations across hundreds of circuits to demonstrate the similarity between learned modular addition circuits that arise naturally from common deep learning paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0Clock\u548cPizza\u4e24\u79cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7535\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u4e3aClock\u548cPizza\u4e24\u79cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5206\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\u5747\u5300\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u52a0\u6cd5\u7535\u8def\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u662f\u5426\u6b63\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6240\u6709\u5bf9\u5e94\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u89c6\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u5206\u6790\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5747\u5300\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u52a0\u6cd5\u7535\u8def\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "Clock\u548cPizza\u89e3\u91ca\u5e76\u975e\u4ee3\u8868\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u540c\u4e00\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u52a0\u6cd5\u7535\u8def\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002"}}

Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.\n  B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u6807\u51c6LLM\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afTransformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u504f\u7f6e\u504f\u79fb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u53d8\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7fa4\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3Transformer\u901a\u5e38\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u667a\u80fd\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u3002\u53d7\u6b64\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4f46\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7fa4\u4f53\u667a\u6167", "method": "B-Trans\u5c06\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u504f\u79fb\u89c6\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u53d8\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540e\u9a8c\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u522b\u51bb\u7ed3\u91c7\u6837\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u6743\u91cd\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b", "result": "\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u3001RLVR\u548c\u65e0\u6807\u7b7eRL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cB-Trans\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "B-Trans\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u6807\u51c6LLM\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afTransformer\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7fa4\u4f53\u667a\u6167\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd"}}

To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks.
