The existing method learns the dynamics in each discrete mode, which suffers from the combination of mode switching and discontinuities in the flows. In this work, we propose CHyLL (Continuous Hybrid System Learning in Latent Space), which learns a continuous neural representation of a hybrid system without trajectory segmentation, event functions, or mode switching. The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems. Finally, we apply CHyLL to the stochastic optimal control problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "CHyLL\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fde\u7eed\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u5272\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5206\u6bb5\u5149\u6ed1\u5546\u6d41\u5f62\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u6bcf\u4e2a\u79bb\u6563\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u5230\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u548c\u6d41\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d41\u3002", "method": "CHyLL\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u91cd\u7f6e\u6620\u5c04\u5728\u5b88\u536b\u8868\u9762\u7c98\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5206\u6bb5\u5149\u6ed1\u5546\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u4f7f\u6d41\u53d8\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u5206\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u3002", "result": "CHyLL\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6d41\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "CHyLL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u5272\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5546\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

In this paper, we analyze the impact of receiver in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance and residual carrier frequency offset (CFO) error on AFDM signals. Our analysis shows that the receiver IQ imbalance may not preserve the sparsity of the AFDM effective channel matrix because of the complex-conjugate operator of the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT). Moreover, the residual CFO error causes energy leakage in the effective channel matrix in the affine domain. To mitigate these effects, we extend the linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) detector to handle the improper Gaussian noise arising from the receiver IQ imbalance.

Survey of RTLS adoption barriers for small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises", "summary": "Real-time location systems (RTLSs) are central to Industry 4.0 and emerging Industry 5.0, providing the spatiotemporal data required for asset tracking, workflow optimization, safety, and integration with WMS, MES, and digital twins. While large enterprises increasingly deploy RTLSs, adoption among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remains limited. This paper examines whether cost and installation complexity are primary barriers to SME adoption. We position RTLSs within the broader Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 landscape and summarize their operational value. We then synthesize evidence from the literature on technical, financial, and organizational constraints, with emphasis on infrastructure requirements, calibration effort, integration with legacy systems, and human factors. To complement this analysis, we report results from an online survey of sixteen manufacturing and technology professionals in Canada and the United States. Respondents report strong perceived value for real-time tracking but identify upfront cost, installation effort, integration difficulty, and reliance on multiple anchor nodes as dominant obstacles. Most indicate acceptable upfront investments below $10,000 and express a clear preference for low-infrastructure deployments with minimized anchor counts. Building on these findings, we outline design directions for SME-focused RTLSs, including wireless and modular architectures, cloud-managed and self-calibrating systems, standardized integration interfaces, and anchor-minimizing or anchor-free localization methods. Overall, the results show that limited SME adoption stems less from insufficient perceived value than from misalignment between current RTLS deployment models and SME resource constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf(RTLS)\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5b89\u88c5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u96be\u5ea6\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ef7\u503c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a4.0\u548c\u7269\u6d414.0\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u4e3a\u4f55\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u91c7\u7528\u7387\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u4f01\u4e1a\u3002", "method": "1. \u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u3001\u8d22\u52a1\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b2. \u5bf916\u540d\u5236\u9020\u548c\u6280\u672f\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5b9e\u9645\u91c7\u7528\u969c\u788d\u548c\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u8ba4\u53efRTLS\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba4\u4e3a\u524d\u671f\u6210\u672c(\u4f4e\u4e8e1\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7)\u3001\u5b89\u88c5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u4e2a\u951a\u8282\u70b9\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u3002\u504f\u597d\u4f4e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u951a\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u91c7\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u5f53\u524dRTLS\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ef7\u503c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u7ebf\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u4e91\u7ba1\u7406\u81ea\u6821\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u951a\u8282\u70b9\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6216\u65e0\u9700\u951a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, their scalability to large-scale graphs remains challenging due to structural redundancy and high-dimensional node features. Existing graph condensation approaches, such as GCond, are primarily developed for homogeneous graphs and rely on gradient matching, resulting in considerable computational, memory, and optimization overhead. We propose HGC-Herd, a training-free condensation framework that generates compact yet informative heterogeneous graphs while maintaining both semantic and structural fidelity. HGC-Herd integrates lightweight feature propagation to encode multi-hop relational context and employs a class-wise herding mechanism to identify representative nodes per class, producing balanced and discriminative subsets for downstream learning tasks. Extensive experiments on ACM, DBLP, and Freebase validate that HGC-Herd attains comparable or superior accuracy to full-graph training while markedly reducing both runtime and memory consumption.

However, the metrics used to evaluate model performance have received comparatively little attention. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) has long been a standard choice for model comparison. Despite its advantages, AUROC is not always ideal, particularly for problems that are invariant to local exchange of classes (LxC), a new form of metric invariance introduced in this work. To address this limitation, we propose LxCIM (LxC-invariant metric), which is not only rank-based and invariant under local exchange of classes, but also intuitive, logically consistent, and always computable, while enabling more detailed analysis through the cumulative accuracy-decision rate curve. Moreover, LxCIM exhibits clear theoretical connections to AUROC, accuracy, and the area under the accuracy-decision rate curve (AUDRC). These relationships allow for multiple complementary interpretations: as a symmetric form of AUROC, a rank-based analogue of accuracy, or a more representative and more interpretable variant of AUDRC. Finally, we demonstrate the direct applicability of LxCIM to the bivariate causal discovery problem (which exhibits invariance to local exchange of classes) and show how it addresses the acknowledged limitations of existing metrics used in this field.

This chapter provides an overview of graph topology identification and statistical inference methods for multidimensional relational data. Approaches for undirected links connecting graph nodes are outlined, going all the way from correlation metrics to covariance selection, and revealing ties with smooth signal priors. To account for directional (possibly causal) relations among nodal variables and address the limitations of linear time-invariant models in handling dynamic as well as nonlinear dependencies, a principled framework is surveyed to capture these complexities through judiciously selected kernels from a prescribed dictionary. Generalizations are also described via structural equations and vector autoregressions that can exploit attributes such as low rank, sparsity, acyclicity, and smoothness to model dynamic processes over possibly time-evolving topologies. It is argued that this approach supports both batch and online learning algorithms with convergence rate guarantees, is amenable to tensor (that is, multi-way array) formulations as well as decompositions that are well-suited for multidimensional network data, and can seamlessly leverage high-order statistical information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7ae0\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u65e0\u5411\u94fe\u63a5\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7b49\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6279\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8111\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u793e\u4ea4\u7b49\u7f51\u7edc\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u5bf9\u591a\u7ef4\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u5230\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u65e0\u5411\u94fe\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6838\u5b57\u5178\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5411\u6027\uff08\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u679c\uff09\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u65e0\u73af\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u7b49\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u5177\u6709\u6536\u655b\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u6279\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\uff08\u591a\u7ef4\u6570\u7ec4\uff09\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u7ef4\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7ae0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u7ef4\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the \"curse of dimensionality,\" rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity.

We characterize the implicit regularization induced through the random weighting, connect it with weighted linear regression, and derive non-asymptotic bounds for convergence in first and second moments. Leveraging geometric moment contraction, we also investigate the stationary distribution induced by the added noise.

To that end, we propose a multi-user multi-input single-output (MISO) pixel antenna system, which deploys the pixel antenna at users, and develop the system model including pixel antenna with antenna coding and multi-user beamspace channels. Aiming at maximizing the sum rate performance, we first propose an algorithm to alternatively design the precoding at the transmitter and the antenna coding at users, which explores the performance boundary for the proposed multi-user MISO pixel antenna system. To reduce the computational complexity, we propose a codebook-based antenna coding design algorithm, where the antenna coder is online optimized from an offline codebook. To further enhance the computation efficiency, we propose a hierarchical codebook-based antenna coding design that uses a multi-layer hierarchical search to achieve a better performance-complexity trade-off. Simulation results show that, adopting the proposed algorithms, the multi-user MISO pixel antenna system can always outperform conventional multi-user MISO systems with fixed antennas.

Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines.

We establish that, under a strongly convex potential, trajectory discrepancies decay at a rate determined by the decay of the memory kernel and are quantitatively bounded by the estimation error of the kernel in a weighted norm. Our analysis integrates synchronized noise coupling with a Volterra comparison theorem, encompassing both subexponential and exponential kernel classes. For first-order models, we derive moment and perturbation bounds using resolvent estimates in weighted spaces. For second-order models with confining potentials, we prove contraction and stability under kernel perturbations using a hypocoercive Lyapunov-type distance. This framework accommodates non-translation-invariant kernels and white-noise forcing, explicitly linking improved kernel estimation to enhanced trajectory prediction.

One representative of use cases is crowd flow estimation on outdoor streets. However, most existing studies have focused on indoor environments or vehicles, and demonstrations of outdoor crowd flow estimation using commercial LTE base station remain limited. This study addresses this use case and proposes an analysis of a crowd flow estimation method using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) obtained from a commercial LTE base station. Specifically, pedestrian counts derived from a camera-based object recognition algorithm were associated with the variance of RSRP. The features obtained from the variance were quantitatively evaluated by combining a CatBoost regression model with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Through this investigation, we clarified that an optimal variance window size for RSRP is 0.1 to 0.2 seconds and that enlarging the counting area increased the features obtained from the variance of RSRP, for machine learning. Consequently, this study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of outdoor crowd flow estimation using commercial LTE, while also revealing the characteristic behavior of variance window size and counting area size in feature design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5546\u7528LTE\u57fa\u7ad9\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba4\u5916\u4eba\u7fa4\u6d41\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86RSRP\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a0.1-0.2\u79d2\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u5927\u8ba1\u6570\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u77406G\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u5230\u6765\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ISAC\uff09\u53d7\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u5ba4\u5916\u8857\u9053\u4eba\u7fa4\u6d41\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u5178\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u6216\u8f66\u8f86\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5546\u7528LTE\u57fa\u7ad9\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba4\u5916\u4eba\u7fa4\u6d41\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5546\u7528LTE\u57fa\u7ad9\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a5\u6536\u529f\u7387\uff08RSRP\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u7fa4\u6d41\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u7b97\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u884c\u4eba\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0eRSRP\u65b9\u5dee\u5173\u8054\u3002\u4f7f\u7528CatBoost\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u4ece\u65b9\u5dee\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0RSRP\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a0.1-0.2\u79d2\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u8ba1\u6570\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u589e\u52a0\u4eceRSRP\u65b9\u5dee\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc1\u660e\u4f7f\u7528\u5546\u7528LTE\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba4\u5916\u4eba\u7fa4\u6d41\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5546\u7528LTE\u57fa\u7ad9\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5ba4\u5916\u4eba\u7fa4\u6d41\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b9\u5dee\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8ba1\u6570\u533a\u57df\u5927\u5c0f\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u65f6\u4ee3ISAC\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

The large aperture of ELAA introduces spatial non-stationarity, where far-apart users have significantly distinct visibility at the antennas, thereby reducing inter-user interference. This insight motivates our novel pilot scheme to group users with distinct visibility regions to share the same frequency subcarriers for channel estimation, so that more users can be served with reduced pilot overhead. Specifically, the proposed pilot scheme employs frequency-division multiplexing for inter-group channel estimation, while intra-group users -- benefiting from strong spatial orthogonality -- are distinguished by shifted cyclic codes, similar to code-division multiplexing. Additionally, we introduce a sub-array structured ELAA, where each sub-array is a traditional MIMO array and treated as spatial stationary, while the distances between sub-arrays can be significantly larger to achieve an expanded aperture. The channel support for sub-arrays features clustered sparsity in the antenna-delay domain and is modeled by a 2-dimensional (2-D) Markov random field (MRF). Based on this, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation algorithm within a turbo Bayesian inference framework that incorporates the 2-D MRF prior model.

We propose Heavy-Ball Synthetic Gradient Extrapolation (HB-SGE), a robust first-order method that combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation. Unlike classical momentum methods that accumulate historical gradients, HB-SGE estimates future gradient directions using local Taylor approximations, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability. We prove convergence guarantees for strongly convex functions and demonstrate empirically that HB-SGE prevents divergence on problems where NAG and standard momentum fail. On ill-conditioned quadratics (condition number $\u03ba=50$), HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations while both SGD and NAG diverge. On the non-convex Rosenbrock function, HB-SGE achieves convergence in 2,718 iterations where classical momentum methods diverge within 10 steps.

It is designed to model complex, uncertain systems whose random outputs are strongly non-Gaussian given deterministic inputs. The architecture itself is a random object stochastically generated by a latent anisotropic Gaussian random field defined on a compact, boundaryless, multiply-connected manifold. The goal is to establish a novel conceptual and mathematical framework in which neural architectures are realizations of a geometry-aware, field-driven generative process. Both the neural topology and synaptic weights emerge jointly from a latent random field. A reduced-order parameterization governs the spatial intensity of an inhomogeneous Poisson process on the manifold, from which neuron locations are sampled. Input and output neurons are identified via extremal evaluations of the latent field, while connectivity is established through geodesic proximity and local field affinity. Synaptic weights are conditionally sampled from the field realization, inducing stochastic output responses even for deterministic inputs. To ensure scalability, the architecture is sparsified via percentile-based diffusion masking, yielding geometry-aware sparse connectivity without ad hoc structural assumptions. Supervised learning is formulated as inference on the generative hyperparameters of the latent field, using a negative log-likelihood loss estimated through Monte Carlo sampling from single-observation-per-input datasets. The paper initiates a mathematical analysis of the model, establishing foundational properties such as well-posedness, measurability, and a preliminary analysis of the expressive variability of the induced stochastic mappings, which support its internal coherence and lay the groundwork for a broader theory of geometry-driven stochastic learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u6f5c\u5728\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u968f\u673a\u573a\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u968f\u673a\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7a81\u89e6\u6743\u91cd\u5171\u540c\u4ece\u6f5c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u573a\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u5e38\u5904\u7406\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u73b0\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u968f\u673a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd9\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7d27\u81f4\u65e0\u8fb9\u591a\u91cd\u8fde\u901a\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u5b9a\u4e49\u6f5c\u5728\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u968f\u673a\u573a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u9f50\u6b21\u6cca\u677e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u91c7\u6837\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u573a\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u5efa\u7acb\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u7a81\u89e6\u6743\u91cd\u4ece\u573a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u6761\u4ef6\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u6269\u6563\u63a9\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6570\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u8bf1\u5bfc\u968f\u673a\u6620\u5c04\u8868\u8fbe\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u9a71\u52a8\u968f\u673a\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6982\u7387\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u89c6\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Multiple-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO) builds on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by fine-tuning LLMs on preference datasets while regularizing the policy towards a mixture of reference models to leverage their collective desirable properties. However, current methods for setting the reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance. To address this, we introduce four new weighting strategies: two offline methods that leverage held-out validation signal; one online method that uses a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting; and an online method that treats reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling. Experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the policy model and seven reference models from the Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, and Phi families (0.5B-14B each) show that all 4 of our strategies outperform the current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy.

The field of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization aims to design methods that generalize better to test environments whose distributions differ from those observed during training. One line of such works has proposed to minimize the maximum risk across environments, a principle that we refer to as MaxRM (Maximum Risk Minimization). In this work, we introduce variants of random forests based on the principle of MaxRM. We provide computationally efficient algorithms and prove statistical consistency for our primary method.

The approach preserves interpretability through a parametric linear component for covariates of primary interest, while a nonparametric DNN component captures complex time-covariate interactions among nuisance variables. We refer to the method as FLEXI-Haz, a flexible hazard model with a partially linear structure. In contrast to existing DNN approaches for partially linear Cox models, FLEXI-Haz does not rely on the proportional hazards assumption. We establish theoretical guarantees: the neural network component attains minimax-optimal convergence rates based on composite Holder classes, and the linear estimator is root-n consistent, asymptotically normal, and semiparametrically efficient. Extensive simulations and real-data analyses demonstrate that FLEXI-Haz provides accurate estimation of the linear effect, offering a principled and interpretable alternative to modern methods based on proportional hazards.

The proposed design integrates symbol shaping to enhance reliability for legitimate users and noise shaping to obscure transmission activities from the targets. For imperfect channel state information (CSI), the framework incorporates bounded uncertainty models for user channels and target angles, yielding a more robust design. The resulting ISCC waveform optimization problem is non-convex; to address this, we develop a low-complexity proximal distance algorithm (PDA) with closed-form updates under both PSK and QAM modulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior covertness and sensing-communication performance with negligible degradation compared to traditional beamforming and conventional SLP approaches without noise-shaping mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u7ea7\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6ce2\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u6574\u5f62\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6574\u5f62\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5728\u7684\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u566a\u58f0\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u4fe1\u606f\u5b89\u5168\u4f20\u8f93\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u6076\u610f\u76ee\u6807\u65e2\u53ef\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u53c8\u53ef\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u89c6\u8005\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u7ea7\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6ce2\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u7b26\u53f7\u6574\u5f62\u589e\u5f3a\u5408\u6cd5\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u6574\u5f62\u9690\u85cf\u4f20\u8f93\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u754c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u8fd1\u7aef\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u652f\u6301PSK\u548cQAM\u8c03\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u611f\u77e5-\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548c\u6ca1\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u6574\u5f62\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u7b26\u53f7\u7ea7\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u7ea7\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u6ce2\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u8f93\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5728\u7684\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While open-weight LLMs enable local deployment, no single model dominates all tasks, motivating ensemble approaches. However, existing LLM ensembles focus on text generation or classification, leaving NER under-explored. In this context, this work proposes a novel three-step ensemble pipeline for zero-shot NER using similarly capable, locally run LLMs. Our method outperforms individual LLMs in four out of five Portuguese NER datasets by leveraging a heuristic to select optimal model combinations with minimal annotated data. Moreover, we show that ensembles obtained on different source datasets generally outperform individual LLMs in cross-dataset configurations, potentially eliminating the need for annotated data for the current task. Our work advances scalable, low-resource, and zero-shot NER by effectively combining multiple small LLMs without fine-tuning.

This approach improves the physical interpretability of surrogate models while achieving high computational efficiency and accuracy. However, the performance and efficiency of PC$^2$ can still be degraded with high-dimensional parameter spaces, limited data availability, or unrepresentative training data. To address this problem, this study explores two complementary enhancements to the PC$^2$ framework. First, a numerically efficient constrained optimization solver, straightforward updating of Lagrange multipliers (SULM), is adopted as an alternative to the conventional KKT solver. The SULM method significantly reduces computational cost when solving physically constrained problems with high-dimensionality and derivative boundary conditions that require a large number of virtual points. Second, a D-optimal sampling strategy is utilized to select informative virtual points to improve the stability and achieve the balance of accuracy and efficiency of the PC$^2$. The proposed methods are integrated into the PC$^2$ framework and evaluated through numerical examples of representative physical systems governed by ordinary or partial differential equations.

However, no CSI dataset has been published from a real-world 5G NR system that facilitates the development and validation of suitable sensing algorithms. To close this gap, we publish three real-world wideband multi-antenna multi-open RAN radio unit (O-RU) CSI datasets from the 5G NR uplink channel: an indoor lab/office room dataset, an outdoor campus courtyard dataset, and a device classification dataset with six commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) user equipments (UEs). These datasets have been recorded using a software-defined 5G NR testbed based on NVIDIA Aerial RAN CoLab Over-the-Air (ARC-OTA) with COTS hardware, which we have deployed at ETH Zurich. We demonstrate the utility of these datasets for three CSI-based sensing tasks: neural UE positioning, channel charting in real-world coordinates, and closed-set device classification. For all these tasks, our results show high accuracy: neural UE positioning achieves 0.6cm (indoor) and 5.7cm (outdoor) mean absolute error, channel charting in real-world coordinates achieves 73cm mean absolute error (outdoor), and device classification achieves 99% (same day) and 95% (next day) accuracy.

Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details. This work is an attempt to establish a macroscopic dynamics theory of complex AI systems, aiming to elevate the study of AI agents from a collection of engineering practices to a science built on effective measurements that are predictable and quantifiable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8be6\u7ec6\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u8868\u660eLLM\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u89c4\u5219\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5e95\u5c42\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u6784\u6210\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u5b8f\u89c2\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5b8f\u89c2\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5efa\u7acbAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u4f5c\u7528\u539f\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cfLLM\u751f\u6210\u72b6\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8be6\u7ec6\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u91cf\u63ed\u793a\u5e95\u5c42\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u8868\u660eLLM\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u89c4\u5219\u96c6\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u7c7b\u5e95\u5c42\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684LLM\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662fLLM\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u9996\u4e2a\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5efa\u7acb\u590d\u6742AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5c06AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u3002"}}

While Transformer-based architectures excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity poses limitations on scalability and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DB2-TransF, a novel Transformer-inspired architecture that replaces the self-attention mechanism with a learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficient layer. This wavelet-based module efficiently captures multi-scale local and global patterns and enhances the modeling of correlations across multiple time series for the time series forecasting task. Extensive experiments on 13 standard forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that DB2-TransF achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy to conventional Transformers, while substantially reducing memory usage for the time series forecasting task. The obtained experimental results position DB2-TransF as a scalable and resource-efficient framework for advanced time series forecasting.

The algorithm iteratively and explicitly adjusts its estimates of the channel and frequency offsets using stochastic gradient descent-based rules and the step sizes of these rules determine the learning rate and stability of the algorithm. Within the stability conditions, the choice of step sizes reflects a trade-off between the algorithm's ability to react to changes in the channel and the ability to minimize misadjustments caused by noise. This paper provides theoretical expressions to predict and optimize the tracking and misadjusment errors of FO-LMS when estimating channels and frequency offsets with known time-varying characteristics. This work also proposes a method to adjust the FO-LMS's step sizes based on the algorithm's performance when the time-varying characteristics are not known, which is more often the case in practice.

Traditional mechanistic models struggle with empirical parameter variability, while purely data-driven models lack physical consistency and rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ). This study introduces a novel Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework employing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for highly accurate, uncertainty-aware Jw prediction. The core innovation lies in training the GPR on the residual error between the detailed, non-linear FO physical model prediction (Jw_physical) and the experimental water flux (Jw_actual). Crucially, we implement a full UQ methodology by decomposing the total predictive variance (sigma2_total) into model uncertainty (epistemic, from GPR's posterior variance) and input uncertainty (aleatoric, analytically propagated via the Delta method for multi-variate correlated inputs). Leveraging the inherent strength of GPR in low-data regimes, the model, trained on a meagre 120 data points, achieved a state-of-the-art Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.26% and an R2 of 0.999 on the independent test data, validating a truly robust and reliable surrogate model for advanced FO process optimization and digital twin development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u5411\u6e17\u900f\u6c34\u901a\u91cf\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528120\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5c31\u8fbe\u52300.26%\u7684MAPE\u548c0.999\u7684R\u00b2\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b63\u5411\u6e17\u900f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u819c\u5206\u79bb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7406-ML\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6c34\u901a\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u603b\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u7528120\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e860.26%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8bef\u5dee\u548c0.999\u7684R\u00b2\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5411\u6e17\u900f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u53ef\u9760\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7406-ML\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6b63\u5411\u6e17\u900f\u6c34\u901a\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5148\u8fdb\u6b63\u5411\u6e17\u900f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In such systems, ML-based localization typically relies on dense grid search, incurring prohibitive computational complexity. To address this, we introduce phase-only localization (POLO), an approach that leverages differential carrier-phase measurements from selected APs to generate a compact set of candidate user positions. The ML cost function is then evaluated only at these candidates, reducing complexity significantly. A key challenge is to devise an AP selection mechanism that reduces the number of candidate points while maintaining reliable coverage. We propose two variants: POLO-I, which selects three APs to provide closed-form candidate positions with low computational cost, and POLO-II, which selects four APs using an alternative strategy that enhances coverage at marginally higher runtime. Comprehensive analytical and simulation results show that POLO achieves a favorable coverage-complexity trade-off, reducing cost by orders of magnitude relative to exhaustive grid search with only marginal loss in coverage. By characterizing this tradeoff under diverse AP configurations, we also provide practical guidelines for selecting between POLO-I and POLO-II depending on latency and coverage requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPOLO\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u8f7d\u6ce2\u76f8\u4f4d\u6d4b\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMIMO\u7cfb\u7edfML\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f51\u683c\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6781\u9ad8\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u76f8\u5e72\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u548c\u7a84\u5e26\u4f20\u8f93\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cML\u4ee3\u4ef7\u51fd\u6570\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5c16\u5cf0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPOLO\uff08\u76f8\u4f4d\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u9009\u5b9aAP\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u8f7d\u6ce2\u76f8\u4f4d\u6d4b\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5019\u9009\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\u96c6\u5408\uff1b2\uff09\u4ec5\u5728\u5019\u9009\u70b9\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30ML\u4ee3\u4ef7\u51fd\u6570\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cdAP\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff1aPOLO-I\u9009\u62e93\u4e2aAP\u63d0\u4f9b\u95ed\u5f0f\u5019\u9009\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff08\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff09\uff0cPOLO-II\u9009\u62e94\u4e2aAP\uff08\u8986\u76d6\u66f4\u597d\u4f46\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7a0d\u9ad8\uff09\u3002", "result": "POLO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8986\u76d6-\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7a77\u4e3e\u7f51\u683c\u641c\u7d22\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8986\u76d6\u635f\u5931\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540cAP\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6839\u636e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u9700\u6c42\u9009\u62e9POLO-I\u6216POLO-II\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "POLO\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dML\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fdAP\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u6d4b\u91cf\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Deep learning mod- els often struggle with real-world distribution changes, exhibit bias against infrequent pathologies, and lack the transparency required for deployment in safety-critical clinical environments. We introduce MedXAI (An Explainable Framework for Med- ical Imaging Classification), a unified expert knowledge based framework that integrates deep vision models with clinician- derived expert knowledge to improve generalization, reduce rare- class bias, and provide human-understandable explanations by localizing the relevant diagnostic features rather than relying on technical post-hoc methods (e.g., Saliency Maps, LIME). We evaluate MedXAI across heterogeneous modalities on two challenging tasks: (i) Seizure Onset Zone localization from resting-state fMRI, and (ii) Diabetic Retinopathy grading.

However, in many scientific and engineering domains, clean data are often unavailable: instead, we only observe measurements corrupted through a noisy, ill-conditioned channel. A generative model for the original data thus requires solving an inverse problem at the level of distributions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to this task based on Stochastic Interpolants: we iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data samples using only access to the corrupted dataset as well as black box access to the corruption channel. Under appropriate conditions, this iterative procedure converges towards a self-consistent transport map that effectively inverts the corruption channel, thus enabling a generative model for the clean data. We refer to the resulting method as the self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI). It (i) is computationally efficient compared to variational alternatives, (ii) highly flexible, handling arbitrary nonlinear forward models with only black-box access, and (iii) enjoys theoretical guarantees.

Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences (\"chunks\") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks. We evaluate our method on challenging, long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks and show that it reliably outperforms prior methods.

The global availability of large-scale viral sequence data presents significant opportunities for computational analysis; however, existing approaches face notable limitations. Phylogenetic tree-based methods are computationally intensive and do not scale efficiently to today's multi-million-sequence datasets. Similarly, current embedding-based techniques often rely on aligned sequences or exhibit suboptimal predictive performance and high runtime costs, creating barriers to practical large-scale analysis. In this study, we focus on the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with the spike protein region and introduce a scalable embedding method that leverages hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike sequences. These embeddings are subsequently used to train a variety of machine learning models for supervised lineage classification. We conduct an extensive evaluation comparing our approach with multiple baseline and state-of-the-art biological sequence embedding methods across diverse metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings offer substantial improvements in efficiency, achieving up to 86.4\\% classification accuracy while reducing embedding generation time by as much as 99.81\\%.

In this paper, we argue that the i.i.d. setting can and should be reframed in terms of exchangeability, a strictly more general symmetry principle. We present the implications of this reframing, alongside two core arguments: (1) a conceptual argument, based on extending the dependency of experimental causal inference on exchangeability to causal discovery; and (2) an empirical argument, showing that many existing i.i.d. causal-discovery methods are predicated on exchangeability assumptions, and that the sole extensive widely-used real-world \"i.i.d.\" benchmark (the T\u00fcbingen dataset) consists mainly of exchangeable (and not i.i.d.) examples. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset that enforces only the exchangeability assumption, without imposing the stronger i.i.d. assumption. We show that our exchangeable synthetic dataset mirrors the statistical structure of the real-world \"i.i.d.\" dataset more closely than all other i.i.d. synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the predictive capability of this dataset by proposing a neural-network-based causal-discovery algorithm trained exclusively on our synthetic dataset, and which performs similarly to other state-of-the-art i.i.d. methods on the real-world benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684i.i.d.\u5047\u8bbe\u91cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u5728i.i.d.\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3ai.i.d.\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5e94\u8be5\u91cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u8bba\u8bc1\uff1a\u5c06\u5b9e\u9a8c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u5bf9\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1b2) \u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bba\u8bc1\uff1a\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709i.i.d.\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u9645\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e3b\u8981\"i.i.d.\"\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08T\u00fcbingen\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u800c\u975ei.i.d.\u6837\u672c\u7ec4\u6210\uff1b3) \u521b\u5efa\u4ec5\u5f3a\u5236\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b4) \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u8be5\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "1) \u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6bd4\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6i.i.d.\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\"i.i.d.\"\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2) \u4ec5\u5728\u8be5\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684i.i.d.\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684i.i.d.\u5047\u8bbe\u5e94\u8be5\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\u65e2\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u53c8\u6709\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality.

Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \\textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \\textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction.

Our solution addresses this problem by contributing new ways to perform local client training and model aggregation. To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \\textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy. When clients are not \\emph{i.i.d}, aggregating their local models may discard certain local adaptations.

Traditional approaches primarily rely on historical time series data to predict the future values.

To address this challenge, multimodal time series forecasting methods which incorporate additional data modalities, mainly text data, alongside time series data have been explored. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined. We also present a text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model to convert raw text data into a form suitable for multimodal forecasting, and we introduce a benchmark that facilitates multimodal forecasting experiments based on this pipeline.

Under review for IEEE TPAMI", "summary": "Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) models have attracted significant attention for their flexibility and uncertainty-quantification capabilities, and have been widely adopted in multi-source transfer learning scenarios due to their ability to capture inter-task correlations. However, they still face several challenges in transfer learning. First, the input spaces of the source and target domains are often heterogeneous, which makes direct knowledge transfer difficult. Second, potential prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored during heterogeneous transfer, hampering the utilization of domain-specific insights and leading to unstable mappings. Third, inappropriate information sharing among target and sources can easily lead to negative transfer. Traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified way. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP). Specifically, a trainable prior probability mapping model is first proposed to align the heterogeneous input domains. The resulting aligned inputs are treated as latent variables, upon which a multi-source transfer GP model is constructed and the entire structure is integrated into a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework.

This study proposes the use of a recent kernel-based neural surrogate, KHRONOS. In this work, we blend sparse high-fidelity (HF) data with low-fidelity (LF) information to predict aerodynamic fields under varying constraints in computational resources. Unlike traditional approaches, KHRONOS is built upon variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. These elements provide a mathematical basis for heavy pruning compared to dense neural networks. Using the AirfRANS dataset as a high-fidelity benchmark and NeuralFoil to generate low-fidelity counterparts, this work compares the performance of KHRONOS with three contemporary model architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN), and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). We consider varying levels of high-fidelity data availability (0%, 10%, and 30%) and increasingly complex geometry parameterizations. These are used to predict the surface pressure coefficient distribution over the airfoil. Results indicate that, whilst all models eventually achieve comparable predictive accuracy, KHRONOS excels in resource-constrained conditions. In this domain, KHRONOS consistently requires orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and delivers much faster training and inference than contemporary dense neural networks at comparable accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of KHRONOS and similar architectures to balance accuracy and efficiency in multi-fidelity aerodynamic field prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "KHRONOS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u573a\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5bc6\u96c6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u7528\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKHRONOS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u539f\u7406\u3001\u63d2\u503c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u6784\u5efa\u6838\u57fa\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u4f7f\u7528AirfRANS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u57fa\u51c6\uff0cNeuralFoil\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\uff080%\u300110%\u300130%\uff09\u548c\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ffc\u578b\u8868\u9762\u538b\u529b\u7cfb\u6570\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eMLP\u3001GNN\u3001PINN\u4e09\u79cd\u5f53\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u7ec8\u90fd\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46KHRONOS\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff1a\u9700\u8981\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5bc6\u96c6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "KHRONOS\u53ca\u5176\u7c7b\u4f3c\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Treatment selection for low to intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis between surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement remains variable in clinical practice, driven by patient heterogeneity and institutional preferences. While existing models predict postprocedural risk, there is a lack of interpretable, individualized treatment recommendations that directly optimize long-term outcomes.\n  Methods. We introduce an interpretable prescriptive framework that integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and an Optimal Policy Tree (OPT) to recommend the treatment minimizing expected 5-year mortality. Using data from Hartford Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, we emulate randomization via prognostic matching and sample weighting and estimate counterfactual mortality under both SAVR and TAVR. The policy model, trained on these counterfactual predictions, partitions patients into clinically coherent subgroups and prescribes the treatment associated with lower estimated risk.\n  Findings. If the OPT prescriptions are applied, counterfactual evaluation showed an estimated reduction in 5-year mortality of 20.3\\% in Hartford and 13.8\\% in St. Vincent's relative to real-life prescriptions, showing promising generalizability to unseen data from a different institution. The learned decision boundaries aligned with real-world outcomes and clinical observations.\n  Interpretation. Our interpretable prescriptive framework is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide transparent, data-driven recommendations for TAVR versus SAVR that improve estimated long-term outcomes both in an internal and external cohort, while remaining clinically grounded and contributing toward a more systematic and evidence-based approach to precision medicine in structural heart disease.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5904\u65b9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u540e\u5339\u914d\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u6811\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u74e3\u72ed\u7a84\u60a3\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u7684SAVR\u6216TAVR\u6cbb\u7597\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u53165\u5e74\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u81f3\u4e2d\u5ea6\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u74e3\u72ed\u7a84\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u624b\u672f\uff08SAVR\uff09\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5bfc\u7ba1\uff08TAVR\uff09\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u74e3\u7f6e\u6362\u672f\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5904\u65b9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u9884\u540e\u5339\u914d\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u6811\uff08OPT\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u540e\u5339\u914d\u548c\u6837\u672c\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u62df\u968f\u673a\u5316\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1SAVR\u548cTAVR\u4e24\u79cd\u6cbb\u7597\u4e0b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u60a3\u8005\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e9a\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u8350\u4f30\u8ba1\u98ce\u9669\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5982\u679c\u5e94\u7528OPT\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a5\u5e74\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u5728Hartford\u533b\u9662\u964d\u4f4e20.3%\uff0c\u5728St. Vincent's\u533b\u9662\u964d\u4f4e13.8%\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\uff09\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5904\u65b9\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u4e3aTAVR\u4e0eSAVR\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u90fd\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u5faa\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The framework supports secure model training and inference without centralizing sensitive data, while enabling cryptographically verifiable policy enforcement across institutions and cloud platforms. A full prototype deployed across hybrid Kubernetes clusters demonstrates reduced membership- inference risk, consistent enforcement of formal privacy budgets, and stable model performance under differential privacy. Ex- perimental evaluation across multi-institution workloads shows that the architecture maintains utility with minimal overhead while providing continuous, risk-aware governance. The pro- posed framework establishes a practical foundation for deploying trustworthy and compliant distributed machine learning systems at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5408\u89c4\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6cbb\u7406\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u907f\u514d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff09\u3001\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff09\u3001\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\uff08\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6cbb\u7406\u3002\u5728\u6df7\u5408Kubernetes\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u5b8c\u6574\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u591a\u673a\u6784\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u6cbb\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6ee1\u8db3\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u6790LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8fed\u4ee3\u53d8\u6362\u89c6\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u6536\u655b\u3001\u53d1\u6563\u6216\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\uff09\u4e86\u89e3\u751a\u5c11\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fed\u4ee3\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u6362\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u5de5\u4ef6\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7b49\u6e17\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f7f\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u4e49\u5224\u65ad\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u5355\u4e00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u91cd\u5199\u5faa\u73af\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u4e14\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c0f\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u603b\u7ed3\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u5faa\u73af\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u754c\u53d1\u6563\u4e14\u65e0\u805a\u7c7b\u5f62\u6210\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6536\u7f29\u548c\u6269\u5f20\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u8fed\u4ee3LLM\u53d8\u6362\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u3001\u53d1\u6563\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing approaches have largely focused on valuing on-ball actions, leaving much of defenders' true impact unmeasured. To address this gap, we propose DEFCON (DEFensive CONtribution evaluator), a comprehensive framework that quantifies player-level defensive contributions for every attacking situation in soccer. Leveraging Graph Attention Networks, DEFCON estimates the success probability and expected value of each attacking option, along with each defender's responsibility for stopping it. These components yield an Expected Possession Value (EPV) for the attacking team before and after each action, and DEFCON assigns positive or negative credits to defenders according to whether they reduced or increased the opponent's EPV. Trained on 2023-24 and evaluated on 2024-25 Eredivisie event and tracking data, DEFCON's aggregated player credits exhibit strong positive correlations with market valuations.

Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%). Comprehensive experiments validate our theoretical discussions and demonstrate the effectiveness of Eminence, confirming an exponential relationship between margin poisoning and adversarial boundary manipulation. Eminence maintains > 90% attack success rate, exhibits negligible clean-accuracy loss, and demonstrates high transferability across diverse models, datasets and scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faEminence\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7a00\u758f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6bd2\u5316\u7387\uff08<0.1%\uff09\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08>1%\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6613\u53d7\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u66b4\u529b\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7406\u89e3\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7a00\u758f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u64cd\u63a7\u3002", "method": "1. \u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7a00\u758f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u64cd\u63a7\uff1b2. \u63a8\u5bfc\u95ed\u5f0f\u6a21\u7cca\u8fb9\u754c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5c11\u91cf\u91cd\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u663e\u8457\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5316\u8fb9\u9645\u6837\u672c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u504f\u79fb\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51faEminence\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u9690\u853d\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u6218\u7565\u6027\u5730\u5229\u7528\u8106\u5f31\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "Eminence\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u6bd2\u5316\u7387\uff08<0.1%\uff09\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0>90%\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u6e05\u6d01\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fb9\u9645\u6bd2\u5316\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u8fb9\u754c\u64cd\u63a7\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6307\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u5728\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Eminence\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u853d\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In this work, we derive a unified operator-theoretoretic description of neural training dynamics directly from gradient descent. Starting from the exact evolution $\\dot e_t = -M(t)e_t$ in function space, we apply Kato perturbation theory to obtain a rigorous system of coupled mode ODEs and show that, after coarse-graining, these dynamics converge to a spectral transport--dissipation PDE \\[ \\partial_t g + \\partial_\u03bb(v g) = -\u03bbg + S, \\] where $v$ captures eigenbasis drift and $S$ encodes nonlocal spectral coupling.\n  We prove that neural training preserves functional regularity, forcing the drift to take an asymptotic power-law form $v(\u03bb,t)\\sim -c(t)\u03bb^b$. In the weak-coupling regime -- naturally induced by spectral locality and SGD noise -- the PDE admits self-similar solutions with a resolution frontier, polynomial amplitude growth, and power-law dissipation. This structure yields explicit scaling-law exponents, explains the geometry of double descent, and shows that the effective training time satisfies $\u03c4(t)=t^\u03b1L(t)$ for slowly varying $L$.\n  Finally, we show that NTK training and feature learning arise as two limits of the same PDE: $v\\equiv 0$ recovers lazy dynamics, while $v\\neq 0$ produces representation drift. Our results provide a unified spectral framework connecting operator geometry, optimization dynamics, and the universal scaling behavior of modern deep networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u63cf\u8ff0\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u8c31\u8f93\u8fd0-\u8017\u6563PDE\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u53cc\u4e0b\u964d\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u7edf\u4e00NTK\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7c97\u7cd9\u6709\u9650\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0cJacobian\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7b97\u5b50\u5448\u73b0\u91cd\u5c3e\u8c31\u548c\u5f3a\u57fa\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u63cf\u8ff0\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001", "method": "\u4ece\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u51fa\u53d1\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u786e\u6f14\u5316\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e94\u7528Kato\u6270\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u5f97\u5230\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u5f0fODE\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u540e\u6536\u655b\u5230\u8c31\u8f93\u8fd0-\u8017\u6563PDE\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u89e3\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f8b", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fdd\u6301\u51fd\u6570\u6b63\u5219\u6027\uff0c\u6f02\u79fb\u5448\u6e10\u8fd1\u5e42\u5f8b\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1b\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\u4e0bPDE\u6709\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u89e3\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u524d\u6cbf\u3001\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u632f\u5e45\u589e\u957f\u548c\u5e42\u5f8b\u8017\u6563\uff1b\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f8b", "conclusion": "NTK\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u540c\u4e00PDE\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6781\u9650\uff1a\u6f02\u79fb\u4e3a\u96f6\u6062\u590d\u60f0\u6027\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u975e\u96f6\u6f02\u79fb\u4ea7\u751f\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u8c31\u6846\u67b6\u8fde\u63a5\u7b97\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u666e\u9002\u5c3a\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a"}}

While deep learning models can express confidence in their predictions, they often suffer from poor calibration, a cognitive bias where expressed confidence does not reflect true competence. Do models truly know what they know? Drawing from human cognitive science, we propose a new framework for evaluating and leveraging AI metacognition. We introduce meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity, to characterise how reliably a model's confidence predicts its own accuracy. We then use this dynamic sensitivity score as context for a bandit-based arbiter that performs test-time model selection, learning which of several expert models to trust for a given task. Our experiments across multiple datasets and deep learning model combinations (including CNNs and VLMs) demonstrate that this metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy over constituent models. This work provides a novel behavioural account of AI models, recasting ensemble selection as a problem of evaluating both short-term signals (confidence prediction scores) and medium-term traits (metacognitive sensitivity).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684AI\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528meta-d'\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u8868\u8fbe\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u5b58\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\"\u77e5\u9053\u5b83\u4eec\u77e5\u9053\u4ec0\u4e48\"\uff0c\u5373\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1) \u5f15\u5165\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684meta-d'\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u81ea\u8eab\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff09\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u7684\u4ef2\u88c1\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u4efb\u54ea\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u5305\u62ecCNN\u548cVLM\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ec4\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3aAI\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5c06\u96c6\u6210\u9009\u62e9\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u77ed\u671f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u6570\uff09\u548c\u4e2d\u671f\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, existing constraint satisfaction methods face efficiency-applicability trade-offs, with hard constraint methods suffering from either high computational complexity or restrictive assumptions on constraint structures. The Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (SKM) method is a randomized iterative algorithm for solving large-scale linear inequality systems with favorable convergence properties, but its argmax operations introduce non-differentiability, posing challenges for neural network applications. This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction. The framework transforms mixed constraint problems into pure inequality problems through null space transformation, employs SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back to the original constraint space, efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints. We provide theoretical proof of post-processing effectiveness in expectation and end-to-end trainability guarantees based on unbiased gradient estimators, demonstrating that despite non-differentiable operations, the framework supports standard backpropagation.

Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process. Comprehensive experiments across several MuJoCo control problems validate the superior effectiveness of UACER, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall performance, stability, and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUACER\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u8870\u51cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u6297\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6536\u655b\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u6297\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u9886\u57df\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8005\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6536\u655b\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "UACER\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) \u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u96c6\u6210\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528K\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u7a33\u5b9aQ\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u5dee\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b2) \u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u8870\u51cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684Q\u503c\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMuJoCo\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86UACER\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "UACER\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u6297\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Standard methods, often relying on a fixed data-mixing ratio, struggle to manage the trade-off between early learning stability and asymptotic performance. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB), a novel approach that dynamically prioritizes data sampling based on a lightweight metric we call 'on-policyness'. Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences. Our extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that ARB consistently mitigates early performance degradation and significantly improves the final performance of various O2O RL algorithms, highlighting the importance of an adaptive, behavior-aware replay buffer design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff08ARB\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5148\u91c7\u6837\u57fa\u4e8e\"\u7b56\u7565\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\"\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u5173\u952e\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u65b0\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff08ARB\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\"\u7b56\u7565\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\"\u6307\u6807\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5148\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002ARB\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709O2O RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u3002\u5b83\u8bc4\u4f30\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8be5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f6c\u79fb\u5206\u914d\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cARB\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u7f13\u89e3\u65e9\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5404\u79cdO2O RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cARB\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing posterior sampling and MAP estimation methods often rely on modeling approximations and can be computationally demanding. In this work, we propose the variational mode-seeking loss (VML), which, when minimized during each reverse diffusion step, guides the generated sample towards the MAP estimate. VML arises from a novel perspective of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion posterior $p(\\mathbf{x}_0|\\mathbf{x}_t)$ and the measurement posterior $p(\\mathbf{x}_0|\\mathbf{y})$, where $\\mathbf{y}$ denotes the measurement. Importantly, for linear inverse problems, VML can be analytically derived and need not be approximated.

In this work, we propose \\textbf{STA-Attention}, a framework that utilizes Top-K Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose the KV cache into interpretable ``semantic atoms.'' Unlike standard $L_1$-regularized SAEs, our Top-K approach eliminates shrinkage bias, preserving the precise dot-product geometry required for attention. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental \\textbf{Key-Value Asymmetry}: while Key vectors serve as highly sparse routers dominated by a ``Semantic Elbow,'' deep Value vectors carry dense content payloads requiring a larger budget. Based on this structure, we introduce a Dual-Budget Strategy that selectively preserves the most informative semantic components while filtering representational noise.

However, its strong reliance on accurate labels makes it inherently vulnerable to label noise, prevalent in real-world scenarios, resulting in significant performance degradation and overfitting. To address this issue, we propose LaT-IB, a novel Label-Noise ResistanT Information Bottleneck method which introduces a \"Minimal-Sufficient-Clean\" (MSC) criterion. Instantiated as a mutual information regularizer to retain task-relevant information while discarding noise, MSC addresses standard IB's vulnerability to noisy label supervision. To achieve this, LaT-IB employs a noise-aware latent disentanglement that decomposes the latent representation into components aligned with to the clean label space and the noise space. Theoretically, we first derive mutual information bounds for each component of our objective including prediction, compression, and disentanglement, and moreover prove that optimizing it encourages representations invariant to input noise and separates clean and noisy label information. Furthermore, we design a three-phase training framework: Warmup, Knowledge Injection and Robust Training, to progressively guide the model toward noise-resistant representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaT-IB achieves superior robustness and efficiency under label noise, significantly enhancing robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios with label noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "LaT-IB\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\"\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u5e72\u51c0\"\u51c6\u5219\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u7f20\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e22\u5f03\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888(IB)\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u6297\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2IB\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLaT-IB\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\"\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u5e72\u51c0\"\u51c6\u5219\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u7f20\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5e72\u51c0\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9884\u70ed\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u89e3\u7f20\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u9f13\u52b1\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u5206\u79bb\u5e72\u51c0\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLaT-IB\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "LaT-IB\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684MSC\u51c6\u5219\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u7f20\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfIB\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

The first contribution addresses constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under the average-cost criterion through the Average-Constrained Policy Optimization (ACPO) algorithm. ACPO integrates sensitivity analysis with trust-region updates to ensure stable constraint handling, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performance with theoretical guarantees. Constrained RL is then extended to finite-horizon settings via e-COP, the first policy optimization method for episodic CMDPs. Built on an episodic policy difference lemma, e-COP offers provable performance, simplicity, and scalability in safety-critical environments. The thesis then investigates reinforcement learning from human preferences. warmPref-PS introduces a posterior sampling strategy for linear bandits that integrates offline preference data from heterogeneous raters into online learning. Explicit modeling of rater competence yields substantial regret reduction and more efficient data collection for RLHF. The PSPL algorithm further advances preference-based RL by jointly sampling reward models and transition dynamics from pairwise trajectory comparisons, providing Bayesian simple-regret guarantees and robust empirical identification of optimal policies. The final contribution applies these methods to large-scale model alignment. A multi-objective constrained optimization view yields MOPO, an iterative algorithm with closed-form updates that scales to multi-billion-parameter language models and remains robust across alignment settings. Collectively, the thesis unifies constrained RL across average-cost, episodic, and preference-driven paradigms, delivering theoretical advances and practical tools for safe and aligned decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u672cCMDPs\u3001\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57dfCMDPs\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u53ca\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ACPO\u3001e-COP\u3001warmPref-PS\u3001PSPL\u548cMOPO\u7b49\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6574\u5408\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u6216\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1.

While quantization techniques have successfully reduced resource requirements in standard deep learning models, their application to probabilistic models remains largely unexplored. We introduce a systematic multi-level quantization framework for Stochastic Variational Inference based BNNs that distinguishes between three quantization strategies: Variational Parameter Quantization (VPQ), Sampled Parameter Quantization (SPQ), and Joint Quantization (JQ). Our logarithmic quantization for variance parameters, and specialized activation functions to preserve the distributional structure are essential for calibrated uncertainty estimation. Through comprehensive experiments on Dirty-MNIST, we demonstrate that BNNs can be quantized down to 4-bit precision while maintaining both classification accuracy and uncertainty disentanglement. At 4 bits, Joint Quantization achieves up to 8x memory reduction compared to floating-point implementations with minimal degradation in epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation.

The methodology integrates machine learning techniques with qualitative insights from migration experts. This approach aims at improving the predictive capacity of data-driven models through the inclusion of a human-assessed covariate, an innovation that addresses challenges posed by sudden shifts in migration patterns and limitations in traditional datasets. The proposed methodology responds directly to the forecasting needs outlined in the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, supporting the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR).

We introduce token-sample complexity: the rate at which attention computed on $n$ tokens converges to its infinite-token limit. We estimate finite-$n$ convergence bounds at two levels: pointwise uniform convergence of the attention map, and convergence of moments for the transformed token distribution. For compactly supported (and more generally sub-Gaussian) distributions, our first result shows that the attention map converges uniformly on a ball of radius $R$ at rate $C(R)/\\sqrt{n}$, where $C(R)$ grows exponentially with $R$. For large $R$, this estimate loses practical value, and our second result addresses this issue by establishing convergence rates for the moments of the transformed distribution (the token output of the attention layer). In this case, the rate is $C'(R)/n^\u03b2$ with $\u03b2<\\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $C'(R)$ depends polynomially on the size of the support of the distribution. The exponent $\u03b2$ depends on the attention geometry and the spectral properties of the tokens distribution. We also examine the regime in which the attention parameter tends to infinity and the softmax approaches a hardmax, and in this setting, we establish a logarithmic rate of convergence.

Explaining outliers is crucial for understanding the underlying factors that contribute to their detection, validating their significance, and identifying potential biases or errors. Effective explanations provide actionable insights, facilitating preventive measures to avoid similar outliers in the future. Counterfactual explanations clarify why specific data points are classified as outliers by identifying minimal changes required to alter their prediction. Although valuable, most existing counterfactual explanation methods overlook the unique challenges posed by outlier detection, and fail to target classical, widely adopted outlier detection algorithms. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is one the most popular unsupervised outlier detection methods, quantifying outlierness through relative local density. Despite LOF's widespread use across diverse applications, it lacks interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Density-based Counterfactuals for Outliers (DCFO), a novel method specifically designed to generate counterfactual explanations for LOF.

While effective, the data structures and principles that enable this crucial capability remain poorly understood. We propose that compositional generalization fundamentally requires decomposing high-level concepts into basic, low-level concepts that can be recombined across similar contexts, similar to how humans draw analogies between concepts. For example, someone who has never seen a peacock eating rice can envision this scene by relating it to their previous observations of a chicken eating rice.\n  In this work, we formalize these intuitive processes using principles of causal modularity and minimal changes. We introduce a hierarchical data-generating process that naturally encodes different levels of concepts and their interaction mechanisms.

While methods like sparse autoencoders (SAEs) show remarkable empirical success, they often lack theoretical guarantees, risking subjective insights. Our primary objective is to establish a principled foundation for interpretable generative models. We demonstrate that the principle of causal minimality -- favoring the simplest causal explanation -- can endow the latent representations of diffusion vision and autoregressive language models with clear causal interpretation and robust, component-wise identifiable control. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models, where higher-level concepts emerge from the constrained composition of lower-level variables, better capturing the complex dependencies in data generation. Under theoretically derived minimality conditions (manifesting as sparsity or compression constraints), we show that learned representations can be equivalent to the true latent variables of the data-generating process. Empirically, applying these constraints to leading generative models allows us to extract their innate hierarchical concept graphs, offering fresh insights into their internal knowledge organization. Furthermore, these causally grounded concepts serve as levers for fine-grained model steering, paving the way for transparent, reliable systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u539f\u5219\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e3b\u89c2\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u539f\u5219\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5c42\u6982\u5ff5\u7531\u4f4e\u5c42\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u7ec4\u5408\u4ea7\u751f\u3002\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u6216\u538b\u7f29\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u53d6\u5176\u5185\u5728\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6982\u5ff5\u56fe\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u679c\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6760\u6746\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u539f\u5219\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Existing spherical operators rely on rotational equivariance but often lack the flexibility for real-world complexity. We propose a general operator-design framework based on the designable spherical Green's function and its harmonic expansion, establishing a solid operator-theoretic foundation for spherical learning. Based on this, we propose an absolute and relative position-dependent Green's function that enables flexible balance of equivariance and invariance for real-world modeling. The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to anisotropic, constraint-rich systems while retaining spectral efficiency. To exploit GSNO, we develop GSHNet, a hierarchical architecture that combines multi-scale spectral modeling with spherical up-down sampling, enhancing global feature representation. Evaluations on diffusion MRI, shallow water dynamics, and global weather forecasting, GSNO and GSHNet consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our results position GSNO as a principled and general framework for spherical operator learning, bridging rigorous theory with real-world complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7403\u9762\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u8c10\u6ce2\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6GSNO\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u7403\u9762\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u7403\u9762\u57df\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u7834\u574f\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7403\u9762\u7b97\u5b50\u4f9d\u8d56\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7403\u9762\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u8c10\u6ce2\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7edd\u5bf9\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002\u6784\u5efaGSNO\u7b97\u5b50\u548cGSHNet\u5c42\u6b21\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8c31\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7403\u9762\u4e0a-\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6269\u6563MRI\u3001\u6d45\u6c34\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5168\u7403\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cGSNO\u548cGSHNet\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5404\u9879\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GSNO\u4e3a\u7403\u9762\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e25\u683c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u7403\u9762\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Specifically, most existing GNNs mainly rely on the message passing strategy between neighbor nodes, where the expressivity is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation. We theoretically prove that the LGAN not only possesses the greater expressive power than the 2-WL under injective aggregation assumptions, but also has lower time complexity.

To that end, we introduce two new computationally inexpensive interpretability and steerability metrics and conduct a systematic analysis on LVLMs. Our analysis uncovers two observations; (i) a majority of SAE neurons exhibit either low interpretability or low steerability or both, rendering them ineffective for downstream use; and (ii) due to the unsupervised nature of SAEs, user-desired concepts are often absent in the learned dictionary, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a novel post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments the latent space with a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to a user-defined concept set. The resulting CB-SAE improves interpretability by +32.1% and steerability by +14.5% across LVLMs and image generation tasks.

Existing approaches often require large-scale player trajectories, train separate models for different player types, or provide no direct mapping between interpretable behavioral parameters and the learned policy, limiting their scalability and controllability. We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets.

Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However, their scaling behavior has not yet been fully explored, with prior work suggesting that they require more data and compute to match the performance of ALMs.\n  We study the scaling behavior of DLMs on different noise types by smoothly interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion while paying close attention to crucial hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate. Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings. We scale our uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for $10^{22}$ FLOPs, confirming the predicted scaling behavior and making it the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model to date.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6bd4\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86100\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u533a\u5206\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5176\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u624d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230ALMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u63d2\u503c\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u548c\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u6765\u7814\u7a76DLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "DLMs\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u4e14\u4e0eALMs\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u635f\u5931\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u6210\u529f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86100\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u662f\u66f4\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5176\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e0e\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u4f46\u66f4\u5c11\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current methods require fine-tuning large diffusion models, which is computationally expensive and often impractical. Building on ratio-based transfer learning for continuous diffusion, we provide Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). This enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser. The same guidance formulation applies to both discrete-time diffusion and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion, yielding a unified treatment. Guided discrete diffusion often requires many forward passes of the guidance network, which becomes impractical for large vocabularies and long sequences. To address this, we further present an efficient guided sampler that concentrates evaluations on planner-selected positions and top candidate tokens, thus lowering sampling time and computation. This makes guided language modeling practical at scale for large vocabularies and long sequences. We evaluate GTL on sequential data, including synthetic Markov chains and language modeling, and provide empirical analyses of its behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGTL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60", "motivation": "\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5fae\u8c03\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGTL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u4ece\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u800c\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c4\u5212\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5019\u9009\u8bcd\u5143", "result": "GTL\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5408\u6210\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4f7f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u53d8\u5f97\u5b9e\u7528", "conclusion": "GTL\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u95ee\u9898"}}

Beyond their interpretability benefits, counterfactuals can also be leveraged for model reconstruction, where a surrogate model is trained to replicate the behavior of a target model. In this work, we demonstrate that model reconstruction can be significantly improved by recognizing that counterfactuals, which typically lie close to the decision boundary, can serve as informative though less representative samples for both classes. This is particularly beneficial in settings with limited access to labeled data. We propose a method that integrates original data samples with counterfactuals to approximate class prototypes using the Wasserstein barycenter, thereby preserving the underlying distributional structure of each class. This approach enhances the quality of the surrogate model and mitigates the issue of decision boundary shift, which commonly arises when counterfactuals are naively treated as ordinary training instances.

While loop temperatures are measured, loop-level mass flows and receiver heat-loss parameters are unobserved, making it impossible to diagnose hydraulic imbalances or receiver degradation using standard monitoring tools.\n  We present a physics-informed learning framework that infers (i) loop-level mass-flow ratios and (ii) time-varying receiver heat-transfer coefficients directly from routine operational data. The method exploits nocturnal homogenization periods -- when hot oil is circulated through a non-irradiated field -- to isolate hydraulic and thermal-loss effects. A differentiable conjugate heat-transfer model is discretized and embedded into an end-to-end learning pipeline optimized using historical plant data from the 50 MW Andasol 3 solar field.\n  The model accurately reconstructs loop temperatures (RMSE $<2^\\circ$C) and produces physically meaningful estimates of loop imbalances and receiver heat losses. Comparison against drone-based infrared thermography (QScan) shows strong correspondence, correctly identifying all areas with high-loss receivers. This demonstrates that noisy real-world CSP operational data contain enough information to recover latent physical parameters when combined with appropriate modeling and differentiable optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4eceCSP\u7535\u5382\u8fd0\u884c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u56de\u8def\u8d28\u91cf\u6d41\u91cf\u6bd4\u548c\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u70ed\u635f\u5931\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6db2\u538b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u9000\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u69fd\u5f0fCSP\u7535\u5382\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u578b\u6db2\u538b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5149\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u70ed\u635f\u5931\u548c\u538b\u964d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5747\u5300\u51fa\u53e3\u6e29\u5ea6\u3002\u4f46\u56de\u8def\u8d28\u91cf\u6d41\u91cf\u548c\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u70ed\u635f\u5931\u53c2\u6570\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bca\u65ad\u6db2\u538b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6216\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u591c\u95f4\u5747\u5300\u5316\u65f6\u6bb5\uff08\u65e0\u8f90\u7167\u65f6\u70ed\u6cb9\u5faa\u73af\uff09\u5206\u79bb\u6db2\u538b\u548c\u70ed\u635f\u5931\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u5fae\u5171\u8f6d\u4f20\u70ed\u6a21\u578b\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u5e76\u5d4c\u5165\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Andasol 3\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u7535\u573a\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u56de\u8def\u6e29\u5ea6\uff08RMSE <2\u00b0C\uff09\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u56de\u8def\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u70ed\u635f\u5931\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u4e0e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ea2\u5916\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\uff08QScan\uff09\u5bf9\u6bd4\u663e\u793a\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u6240\u6709\u9ad8\u635f\u5931\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5608\u6742\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cCSP\u8fd0\u884c\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u5408\u9002\u5f53\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u53ef\u5fae\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8db3\u591f\u4fe1\u606f\u6062\u590d\u6f5c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e3aCSP\u7535\u5382\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem, the problem of finding a pruning mask which minimizes the per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem to optimality using Integer Programming (IP) solvers is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches therefore rely on approximations or heuristics. In this work, we demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) that can be computed efficiently using the Gram matrix of the calibration data. Using these observations, we propose a tractable and simple 1-swap algorithm that warm starts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free. We demonstrate that our approach reduces per-layer pruning error by up to 60% over Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across state-of-the-art GPT architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u7ea7\u7b49\u7a00\u758f\u7ea6\u675f\u548c1-swap\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u526a\u679d\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u5b8c\u6574\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6062\u590d\u526a\u679d\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u4ee3\u4ef7\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff1b2) \u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u5c40\u5e45\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u51b3\u5c42\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u7ea7\u7b49\u7a00\u758f\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u8026\u884c\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u76841-swap\u6700\u4f18\u4ea4\u6362\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fdd\u7559\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u4e00\u4e2a\u526a\u679d\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\uff09\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u7684Gram\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u76841-swap\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ece\u4efb\u610f\u526a\u679d\u63a9\u7801\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4e14\u57fa\u672c\u65e0\u9700\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4Wanda\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe60%\u3002\u5728\u5148\u8fdb\u7684GPT\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u7ea7\u7b49\u7a00\u758f\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u9ad8\u65481-swap\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u63a9\u7801\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u526a\u679d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

This article investigates these issues through the case of the BlueROV2, an open platform widely used for scientific experimentation. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, using an observation space that combines target-oriented navigation information, a virtual occupancy grid, and ray-casting along the boundaries of the operational area. The learned policy is compared against a reference deterministic kinematic planner, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), commonly employed as a robust baseline for obstacle avoidance. The evaluation is conducted in a realistic simulation environment and complemented by validation on a physical BlueROV2 supervised by a 3D digital twin of the test site, helping to reduce risks associated with real-world experimentation.

Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs.

Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling.

In many real-world scenarios, such as acquiring data from public repositories or sharing across institutions, data is naturally organized into discrete datasets that vary in relevance, quality, and utility. Selecting which repositories or institutions to search for useful datasets, and which datasets to incorporate into model training are therefore critical decisions, yet most existing methods select individual samples and treat all data as equally relevant, ignoring differences between datasets and their sources. In this work, we formalize the task of dataset selection: selecting entire datasets from a large, heterogeneous pool to improve downstream performance under resource constraints. We propose Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH), a dataset selection method that models utility at both dataset and group (e.g., collections, institutions) levels, enabling efficient generalization from limited observations. Across two public benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet), DaSH outperforms state-of-the-art data selection baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy, while requiring significantly fewer exploration steps. Ablations show DaSH is robust to low-resource settings and lack of relevant datasets, making it suitable for scalable and adaptive dataset selection in practical multi-source learning workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "DaSH\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7ec4\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4ece\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u6c60\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7528\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u9009\u62e9\u5355\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u540c\u7b49\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u5176\u6765\u6e90\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u9009\u62e9\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7ec4\uff08\u5982\u96c6\u5408\u3001\u673a\u6784\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u89c2\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08Digit-Five\u548cDomainNet\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cDaSH\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe26.2%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDaSH\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DaSH\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7ec4\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u591a\u6e90\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow ($\\textbf{BiFlow}$), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude. BiFlow yields state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation (\"1-NFE\") methods. Following recent encouraging progress on NFs, we hope our work will draw further attention to this classical paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "BiFlow\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5411\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9006\u6620\u5c04\u800c\u975e\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u6790\u9006\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7801\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u767e\u500d\u91c7\u6837\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u524d\u5411\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7801\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u6700\u8fd1TARFlow\u7b49\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6d41\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u590d\u5174\u4e86NF\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7801\u95ee\u9898\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5411\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41(BiFlow)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0d\u518d\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u6790\u9006\u3002BiFlow\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9006\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u9006\u5411\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\uff0cBiFlow\u76f8\u6bd4\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7801\u5bf9\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff08\u767e\u500d\uff09\u3002\u5728NF\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "BiFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u9664\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u6790\u9006\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86NF\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7801\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3aNF\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ecf\u5178\u8303\u5f0f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
