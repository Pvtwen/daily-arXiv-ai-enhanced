The presence of a LOS impacts other channel characteristics such as pathloss, fading depth, delay- and angular spread, etc.. Existing models, although useful, are based on very limited datasets. In this paper, we establish a framework to produce high accuracy LOS models from geospatial data in different environments, and apply it to create a LOS model for macrocells, using datasets of the United States (US) on a nationalscale, using more than 13, 000 locations of real-world macrocells. Based on this we create a new, fully parameterized model that better describes macrocell deployments in the US than the 3GPP model. We furthermore demonstrate that for improved accuracy the LOS probability should be modeled on a per cell basis, and the model parameters treated as random variables; we provide a full description and parameterization of this novel approach and by simulations show that it better predicts the inter-cell interference at the cell-edge than an average-based model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u521b\u5efa\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6LOS\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u5168\u56fd\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u5b8f\u8702\u7a9d\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u8fc713,000\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5b8f\u8702\u7a9d\u57fa\u7ad9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6bd43GPP\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u7684LOS\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u89c4\u5212\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4ece\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6LOS\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7f8e\u56fd\u5168\u56fd\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u5b8f\u8702\u7a9d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ad9\u7684LOS\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u6bd43GPP\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b8f\u8702\u7a9d\u90e8\u7f72\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ad9\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u5e73\u5747\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u5c0f\u533a\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "LOS\u6982\u7387\u5e94\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ad9\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, most existing ML-based methods rely on large, accurately labeled datasets with location information, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. This paper proposes a generative framework to recover location labels directly from sequences of sparse channel state information (CSI) measurements, without explicit location labels for radio map construction. Instead of directly storing raw CSI, we learn a compact low-dimensional radio map embedding and leverage a generative model to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI. Specifically, to address the uncertainty of sparse CSI, a dual-scale feature extraction scheme is designed to enhance feature representation by jointly exploiting correlations from angular space and across neighboring samples. We develop a hybrid recurrent-convolutional encoder to learn mobility patterns, which combines a truncation strategy and multi-scale convolutions in the recurrent neural network (RNN) to ensure feature robustness against short-term fluctuations. Unlike conventional Gaussian priors in latent space, we embed a learnable radio map to capture the location information by encoding high-level positional features from CSI measurements. Finally, a diffusion-based generative decoder reconstructs the full CSI with high fidelity by conditioning on the positional features in the radio map. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can improve localization accuracy by over 30% and achieve a 20% capacity gain in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios compared with model-based Kalman filter approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u7a00\u758fCSI\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u5373\u53ef\u6784\u5efa\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5faa\u73af-\u5377\u79ef\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574CSI\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5e26\u6709\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6848\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u89d2\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u76f8\u90bb\u6837\u672c\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6df7\u5408\u5faa\u73af-\u5377\u79ef\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u6355\u83b7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u5efaCSI\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u53ef\u5c06\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad830%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b020%\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4ece\u7a00\u758fCSI\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing designs sit at two costly extremes: dynamic reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer fine beam control but require dense cabling, continuous power consumption, and substantial signaling overhead, whereas low-cost static surfaces require no control lines or electronics but are limited to a single beam pattern. This disparity leaves a practical gap for quasi-static environments, such as industrial Internet-of-things and smart agriculture scenarios, where channels are stable with user demands changing only occasionally or periodically, and neither extreme is sufficiently economical or flexible. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel movable intelligent surface (MIS) architecture, whose beam patterns are switched not by electronic phase tuning but by mechanically sliding a small, pre-phased secondary metasurface layer across a larger, likewise static primary layer. We develop an MIS signal model that characterizes the interaction between static phase elements with dynamic geometry via binary selection matrices. Based on this model, we formulate a new type of optimization problems that jointly design static phase shifts and the overlapping position selection of MS2 (equal to beam pattern scheduling). Efficient algorithms based on the penalty method, block coordinate descent, and Riemannian manifold optimization are proposed to tackle these mixed-integer non-convex problems.

A Gaussian process prior is placed over the latent function, with hierarchical priors on its hyperparameters to encode physically meaningful structure in the predictive posterior.\n  To guide data acquisition, we derive entropy-based acquisition functions that quantify expected information gain from candidate input locations, identifying samples most informative for training the surrogate.

These derivations approximate the predictive posterior as a finite, uniformly weighted mixture of Gaussian processes.\n  We demonstrate the framework's utility by modeling activity coefficients in vapor-liquid equilibrium systems, embedding the surrogate into extended Raoult's law for distillation design. Numerical results show that entropy-guided sampling improves sample efficiency by targeting regions of high uncertainty and potential information gain.

Despite their practical success, theoretically understanding the gradient descent dynamics for training DEQs remains an area of active research. In this work, we rigorously study the gradient descent dynamics for DEQs in the simple setting of linear models and single-index models, filling several gaps in the literature.

Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety.\n  In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories. The combined objective is theoretically compatible with a wide range of condensation paradigms and supports stable first-order optimization. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets and diverse forecasting architectures demonstrate that DDTime consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, achieving about 30% relative accuracy gains while introducing about 2.49% computational overhead.

In this paper, a distributed cubature Kalman filter based on adaptive minimum error entropy with fiducial points (AMEEF) criterion (AMEEF-DCKF) is proposed to overcome the above limitations. Specifically, firstly, in order to solve the influence of various types of non-Gaussian noise and abnormal data, the AMEEF optimization criterion is designed, in which the kernels used are Cauchy kernels with adaptive bandwidth. At the same time, the designed optimization criterion has enhanced the numerical stability and optimized the kernel bandwidth value. Next, in order to address the communication burden problem in multi-sensor networks, where a leader and a follower are distinguished, a distributed algorithm is constructed to achieve an average consensus among these sensors, called leader-follower average consensus (LFAC).

SAVeD addresses a common challenge in data science of repeated labor due to a difficulty of similar work or transformations on datasets. SAVeD employs a modified SimCLR pipeline, generating augmented table views through random transformations (e.g., row deletion, encoding perturbations). These views are embedded via a custom transformer encoder and contrasted in latent space to optimize semantic similarity. Our model learns to minimize distances between augmented views of the same dataset and maximize those between unrelated tables. We evaluate performance using validation accuracy and separation, defined respectively as the proportion of correctly classified version/non-version pairs on a hold-out set, and the difference between average similarities of versioned and non-versioned tables (defined by a benchmark, and not provided to the model). Our experiments span five canonical datasets from the Semantic Versioning in Databases Benchmark, and demonstrate substantial gains post-training. SAVeD achieves significantly higher accuracy on completely unseen tables in, and a significant boost in separation scores, confirming its capability to distinguish semantically altered versions.

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era.

However, the current literature lacks open platforms to gather datasets for the training of such ML techniques and to evaluate novel beam management approaches in real-time, real-world scenarios and full-stack endto-end networks. In this work, we present our SDR-based experimental platform based on OpenAirInterface and are the first to integrate popular low-cost antenna array transceivers, beam sweeping capabilities, and a highly-modular sensor framework and associated interfaces into such a full-stack experimental platform.

In this paper, we introduce CurvSSL, a curvature-regularized self-supervised learning framework, and its RKHS extension, kernel CurvSSL. Our approach retains a standard two-view encoder-projector architecture with a Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss on projected features, but augments it with a curvature-based regularizer. Each embedding is treated as a vertex whose $k$ nearest neighbors define a discrete curvature score via cosine interactions on the unit hypersphere; in the kernel variant, curvature is computed from a normalized local Gram matrix in an RKHS. These scores are aligned and decorrelated across augmentations by a Barlow-style loss on a curvature-derived matrix, encouraging both view invariance and consistency of local manifold bending. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with a ResNet-18 backbone show that curvature-regularized SSL yields competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg.

To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes.

However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees.

We then derive a set of energy descriptors based on this demodulation and compare their classification performance against established signal energy and power spectrum features. TKEO features outperform the respective baselines in motor imagery and epilepsy detection, whereas they perform on par in emotion recognition. Our findings suggest that the proposed TKEO-based pipeline provides an intuitive framework for extracting EEG signal dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Teager-Kaiser\u80fd\u91cf\u7b97\u5b50(TKEO)\u5728EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Gabor\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7ec4\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u79bb\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u60f3\u8c61\u548c\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5177\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u6613\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22TKEO\u7b97\u5b50\u5bf9EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Gabor\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7ec4\u5206\u79bb\u6807\u51c6\u9891\u5e26\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u79bb\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06TKEO\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5e45\u5ea6\u5305\u7edc\u548c\u77ac\u65f6\u9891\u7387\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u7ec4\u80fd\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u3002", "result": "TKEO\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u60f3\u8c61\u548c\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eTKEO\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e3a\u63d0\u53d6EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs. Experiments on multiple MLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that FlashCache outperforms state-of-the-art multimoal KV compression methods, achieving up to 1.69 times faster decoding with 80% lower KV memory usage while maintaining task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashCache\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5f02\u5e38KV\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u504f\u79bb\u4e3b\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u5f02\u5e38KV\u5bf9\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u968f\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u957f\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u6838\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "1) \u5728\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790KV\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u91cf\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u5f02\u5e38KV\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u7559\u504f\u79bb\u4e3b\u80fd\u91cf\u7684KV\u5bf9\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u5c42KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMLLM\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFlashCache\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b01.69\u500d\u89e3\u7801\u52a0\u901f\uff0cKV\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e80%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FlashCache\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f02\u5e38KV\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While this iff constraint aligns with many real-world applications, recent work has shown that most deep learning-based MIL approaches violate it, leading to inflated performance metrics and poor generalization. We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation.

Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity.

To address both gaps, we introduce MOCET, an interpretable and doubly-scalable metric (automatable and open-ended) that can quantify real-world risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMOCET\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u5b89\u5168\u7b49\u7ea7\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9ASL-3+\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5982LAB-Bench\u3001BioLP-bench\u548cWMDP\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u91cf\u5316\"\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u98ce\u9669\"\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8ddf\u4e0aLLM\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MOCET\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53cc\u91cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff08\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "MOCET\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "MOCET\u4e3aLLM\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8ddf\u4e0aAI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

The recently introduced Mamba architecture outperformed an advanced Transformer (Transformer++) based on Llama in handling long context lengths, while using fewer model parameters. Despite the impressive performance of these architectures, a systematic approach to empirically analyze model performance and efficiency under various settings is not well established in the medical domain. The performances of six sequence models were investigated across three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) in a large Swedish heart failure (HF) cohort (N = 42820), providing a clinically relevant case study. Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers. At equal model size, Llama and Mambas achieve superior performance using 25% less training data.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a general UQ framework that provides statistically valid guarantees, which is especially useful in practice. However, prior ordinal CP methods mainly focus on heuristic algorithms or restrictively require the underlying model to predict a unimodal distribution over ordinal labels. Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets from diverse domains are conducted to demonstrate the significantly improved predictive efficiency of the proposed methods over baselines (by 15% decrease on average over four datasets).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u5206\u7c7b\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u6570\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u6216\u8981\u6c42\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u5cf0\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e8f\u6570\u5171\u5f62\u5206\u7c7b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u957f\u5ea6\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\u6765\u7f29\u5c0f\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1115%\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5e8f\u6570\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To address this question in the auditory domain, we quantified the alignment between the internal representations of 36 different audio models and brain activity from two independent fMRI datasets. Using voxel-wise and component-wise regression, and representation similarity analysis (RSA), we found that recent self-supervised audio models with strong performance in diverse downstream tasks are better predictors of auditory cortex activity than older and more specialized models. To assess the quality of the audio representations, we evaluated these models in 6 auditory tasks from the HEAREval benchmark, spanning music, speech, and environmental sounds. This revealed strong positive Pearson correlations ($r>0.7$) between a model's overall task performance and its alignment with brain representations. Finally, we analyzed the evolution of the similarity between audio and brain representations during the pretraining of EnCodecMAE. We discovered that brain similarity increases progressively and emerges early during pretraining, despite the model not being explicitly optimized for this objective. This suggests that brain-like representations can be an emergent byproduct of learning to reconstruct missing information from naturalistic audio data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u542c\u89c9\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5927\u8111\u8868\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u5927\u8111\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u4e0e\u5927\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\u66f4\u52a0\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u542c\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752836\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acbfMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5927\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4f53\u7d20\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u6210\u5206\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u6790(RSA)\uff0c\u5e76\u5728HEAREval\u57fa\u51c6\u76846\u4e2a\u542c\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u542c\u89c9\u76ae\u5c42\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5927\u8111\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u5448\u5f3a\u6b63\u76f8\u5173(r>0.7)\uff0c\u4e14EnCodecMAE\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5927\u8111\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f1a\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8111\u6837\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u97f3\u9891\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u5efa\u7f3a\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\u526f\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u3002"}}

The use of vocal biomarkers to support the early diagnosis of PD presents a non-invasive, low-cost, and accessible alternative in clinical settings. Thus, the objective of this cross-sectional study was to consistently evaluate the effectiveness of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in distinguishing individuals with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls, in comparison with traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, using vocal biomarkers. Two publicly available voice datasets were used. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from the samples, and model robustness was assessed using a validation strategy with 1000 independent random executions. Performance was evaluated using classification statistics. Since normality assumptions were not satisfied, non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni post-hoc tests) were applied to verify whether the tested classification models were similar or different in the classification of PD. With an average accuracy of $98.65\\%$ and $92.11\\%$ on the Italian Voice dataset and Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, respectively, the DNN demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional ML models, while also achieving competitive results when benchmarked against relevant studies.

Current LLM selection methods typically optimize for a single fixed objective, such as performance, cost, or a trade-off between them, and fail to learn individual user preferences from interaction data. To address these limitations, we propose PersonalizedRouter, a graph-based framework that models diverse user profiles and performs personalized LLM selection by leveraging interaction data that includes task context, queries, candidate LLMs, and user decisions. To capture contextual information between user queries and optimal LLMs, PersonalizedRouter converts the interaction data into a heterogeneous graph, where the relationships between different types of nodes are represented by edges. To evaluate adaptability across users, we design two strategies: the multi-cost-efficiency simulation strategy and the LLM-as-a-Judge strategy. In addition, we construct PersonaRoute-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 1,000 simulated users and 10 LLMs. Experimental results show that PersonalizedRouter significantly outperforms existing LLM selection methods and surpasses the strongest methods by a large margin of 15.38% and 9.83% under two simulation strategies. On the PersonaRoute-Bench with 1,000 users, it further surpasses the best methods by 16.19% and 59.69% while maintaining higher efficiency.

Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints.

While deep learning has emerged as the dominant approach, several key challenges remain unresolved. First, sub-trajectory anomaly detection, capable of pinpointing the precise segments where anomalies occur, remains underexplored compared to whole-trajectory analysis. Second, many existing methods depend on carefully tuned thresholds, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications. Moreover, the irregular sampling of trajectory data and the presence of noise in training sets further degrade model performance, making it difficult to learn reliable representations of normal routes. To address these challenges, we propose a contrastive reinforcement learning framework for online trajectory anomaly detection, CroTad. Our method is threshold-free and robust to noisy, irregularly sampled data. By incorporating contrastive learning, CroTad learns to extract diverse normal travel patterns for different itineraries and effectively distinguish anomalous behaviours at both sub-trajectory and point levels. The detection module leverages deep reinforcement learning to perform online, real-time anomaly scoring, enabling timely and fine-grained identification of abnormal segments.

We present an end-to-end classification pipeline to address these issues. We train a latent ODE to model continuous ECG waveforms and create robust feature vectors from high-frequency single-channel signals. We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz. We then use a gradient boosted tree to classify these vectors and test robustness across frequencies. Performance shows minimal degradation, with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values of 0.984, 0.978, and 0.976 at 360 Hz, 90 Hz, and 45 Hz, respectively, suggesting a way to sidestep the trade-off between signal fidelity and battery life.

Manual claim drafting is labor-intensive, costly, and inherently inconsistent, while conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the structured, iterative reasoning essential for precise claim refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce Tree of Claims (ToC), an innovative framework that redefines claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system, comprising an LLM-based EditorAgent that proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent that mimics patent examiner critiques through structured, chain-of-thought analyses of novelty and prior art disclosure. Driven by a carefully designed multi-objective reward function, ToC jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8\\%, and up to 9\\% in certain cases. Extensive experiments, including detailed ablation studies, validate ToC's efficacy in generating superior, legally robust claim revisions.

Training these models is computationally intensive, and centralizing the process raises significant data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling alternative, but existing Federated Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) methods face severe communication bottlenecks as their reliance on transmitting multiple gradients to a server is unscalable for large models. We introduce FIRM (Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective alignment), a novel algorithm that achieves both client disagreement drift mitigation and communication efficiency. In FIRM, each client locally solves a regularized multi-objective optimization problem. By directly mitigating client disagreement drift through in-client regularization, our method eliminates the need for the multi-gradient transmissions common in prior works. Consequently, clients need only to transmit a single set of adapted parameters, maintaining high communication efficiency. We prove that our algorithm converges to Pareto-stationary points and, to our knowledge, provide the first finite-time convergence guarantees for this federated multi-objective alignment setting. Empirically, we show that FIRM leads to smoother training dynamics, reduced client disagreement drift, and improved reward trade-offs compared to baselines. We further propose a method to incorporate a preference over the objectives and report empirical Pareto plots, demonstrating that FIRM can smoothly adapt trade-offs between objectives in response to specified preferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "FIRM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5185\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u8f93\u591a\u4e2a\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u7a33\u5b9a\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u8f93\u591a\u4e2a\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "FIRM\u7b97\u6cd5\u8ba9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5185\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u76f4\u63a5\u7f13\u89e3\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u6b67\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u4f20\u8f93\u5355\u7ec4\u9002\u5e94\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "FIRM\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u6b67\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u6539\u5584\u5956\u52b1\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u504f\u597d\u5e73\u6ed1\u8c03\u6574\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "FIRM\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, with its model architecture composed of Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) representation learning modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the MEV-based reconstruction and contrastive learning pathways enhance the generalization. That is, the MEV reconstruction facilitates multi-perspective complementary to prevent the masking from premature convergence, and the clustering-guided contrastive learning facilitates the joint optimization of representation and clustering. Extensive experiments on 15 real benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of EMTC in comparison with eight SOTA methods, where the EMTC achieves an average improvement of 4.85% over the strongest baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEMTC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u591a\u5185\u751f\u89c6\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u7a33\u6001\u673a\u5668\u8fd0\u884c\u8bb0\u5f55\u3001\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u53d1\u7535\u96f6\u8f93\u51fa\u671f\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5197\u4f59\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u5224\u522b\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u7c7b\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEMTC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u53d8\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\uff08IVM\uff09\u548c\u591a\u5185\u751f\u89c6\u56fe\uff08MEV\uff09\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u3002IVM\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5177\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u8868\u793a\uff0cMEV\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u572815\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEMTC\u4f18\u4e8e8\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53474.85%\u3002", "conclusion": "EMTC\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations. These results validate the compute-bound nature of diffusion inference and provide a foundation for sustainable AI deployment planning and carbon footprint estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff08FLOPs\uff09\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bGPU\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Kaplan\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5efa\u7acb\u80fd\u8017\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548cGPU\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u8017\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u67b6\u6784\u5185\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff08R\u5e73\u65b9>0.9\uff09\uff0c\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u89c1\u6a21\u578b-\u786c\u4ef6\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eedAI\u90e8\u7f72\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u4f30\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

At each epoch, Step-E ranks samples by loss and gradually increases the fraction of high-loss examples that are excluded from gradient updates after a brief warm-up stage, yielding an online curriculum that focuses on easy and consistent examples and eventually ignores persistent outliers. On CIFAR-100N, Step-E improves the test accuracy of a ResNet-18 model from 43.3% (+/- 0.7%) to 50.4% (+/- 0.9%), clearly outperforming loss truncation, self-paced learning, and one-shot filtering while approaching the clean-label oracle at 60.5% (+/- 0.2%). On CIFAR-10N (aggre), Step-E also improves over the noisy baseline (85.3% vs. 83.9%) and nearly matches the clean-label oracle (85.9%), with only moderate training-time overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Step-E\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6392\u540d\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u6392\u9664\u9ad8\u635f\u5931\u6837\u672c\u6765\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728CIFAR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u91ce\u5916\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "Step-E\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2aepoch\u4e2d\u6839\u636e\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5728\u77ed\u6682\u7684\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u540e\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u88ab\u6392\u9664\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u9ad8\u635f\u5931\u6837\u672c\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u7ebf\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5ffd\u7565\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100N\u4e0a\uff0cStep-E\u5c06ResNet-18\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece43.3%\u63d0\u5347\u523050.4%\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u635f\u5931\u622a\u65ad\u3001\u81ea\u5b9a\u6b65\u8c03\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd160.5%\u7684\u5e72\u51c0\u6807\u7b7eoracle\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728CIFAR-10N\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e5f\u4ece83.9%\u63d0\u5347\u523085.3%\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd185.9%\u7684\u5e72\u51c0\u6807\u7b7eoracle\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u9002\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "Step-E\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5e72\u51c0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

Recent work finds that language models can use tools in ways that contradict the interests or explicit instructions of the user.

We introduce an evaluation suite of diverse and realistic staged misconduct scenarios to assess agents for this behavior. Across models and settings, we find that: (1) the frequency of whistleblowing varies widely across model families, (2) increasing the complexity of the task the agent is instructed to complete lowers whistleblowing tendencies, (3) nudging the agent in the system prompt to act morally substantially raises whistleblowing rates, and (4) giving the model more obvious avenues for non-whistleblowing behavior, by providing more tools and a detailed workflow to follow, decreases whistleblowing rates.

Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients (\"retain-invariant\"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives.

Long-term satellite-based LST records, such as those derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are essential for detecting climate trends. However, the coarse spatial resolution of AVHRR's global area coverage (GAC) data limit their utility for analyzing fine-scale permafrost dynamics and other surface processes in the Arctic. This paper presents a new 42 years pan-Arctic LST dataset, downscaled from AVHRR GAC to 1 km with a super-resolution algorithm based on a deep anisotropic diffusion model. The model is trained on MODIS LST data, using coarsened inputs and native-resolution outputs, guided by high-resolution land cover, digital elevation, and vegetation height maps. The resulting dataset provides twice-daily, 1 km LST observations for the entire pan-Arctic region over four decades. This enhanced dataset enables improved modelling of permafrost, reconstruction of near-surface air temperature, and assessment of surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Additionally, it supports climate monitoring efforts in the pre-MODIS era and offers a framework adaptable to future satellite missions for thermal infrared observation and climate data record continuity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a42\u5e74\u6cdb\u5317\u6781\u5730\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06AVHRR GAC\u6570\u636e\u4ece\u7c97\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52301\u516c\u91cc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u5317\u6781\u5730\u533a\u591a\u5e74\u51bb\u571f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5317\u6781\u5730\u533a\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u6696\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709AVHRR\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f83\u7c97\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u591a\u5e74\u51bb\u571f\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5730\u8868\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5MODIS LST\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7a0b\u548c\u690d\u88ab\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u5c06AVHRR GAC\u6570\u636e\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52301\u516c\u91cc\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u4e8642\u5e74\u6cdb\u5317\u6781\u5730\u533a\u6bcf\u65e5\u4e24\u6b21\u76841\u516c\u91cc\u5206\u8fa8\u7387LST\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u591a\u5e74\u51bb\u571f\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8fd1\u5730\u8868\u6c14\u6e29\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u683c\u9675\u5170\u51b0\u76d6\u8868\u9762\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86MODIS\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u5317\u6781\u6c14\u5019\u76d1\u6d4b\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u89c2\u6d4b\u536b\u661f\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u6570\u636e\u8bb0\u5f55\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Here we propose TS-DFM, a flow matching framework that predicts TSs from reactants and products. By operating in molecular distance geometry space, TS-DFM explicitly captures the dynamic changes of interatomic distances in chemical reactions. A network structure named TSDVNet is designed to learn the velocity field for generating TS geometries accurately. On the benchmark dataset Transition1X, TS-DFM outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method React-OT by 30\\% in structural accuracy.

Code to be released upon full publication", "summary": "Sampling useful three-dimensional molecular structures along with their most favorable conformations is a key challenge in drug discovery. Current state-of-the-art 3D de-novo design flow matching or diffusion-based models are limited to generating a single conformation. However, the conformational landscape of a molecule determines its observable properties and how tightly it is able to bind to a given protein target. By generating a representative set of low-energy conformers, we can more directly assess these properties and potentially improve the ability to generate molecules with desired thermodynamic observables. Towards this aim, we propose FlexiFlow, a novel architecture that extends flow-matching models, allowing for the joint sampling of molecules along with multiple conformations while preserving both equivariance and permutation invariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the QM9 and GEOM Drugs datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular generation tasks. Our results show that FlexiFlow can generate valid, unstrained, unique, and novel molecules with high fidelity to the training data distribution, while also capturing the conformational diversity of molecules. Moreover, we show that our model can generate conformational ensembles that provide similar coverage to state-of-the-art physics-based methods at a fraction of the inference time.

However, conventional prompt tuning methods are prone to overfitting and can struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. To address these limitations, Bayesian prompt learning has been proposed, which frames prompt optimization as a Bayesian inference problem to enhance robustness. This paper introduces Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL), a novel method for Bayesian prompt learning, designed to efficiently explore the complex and often multimodal posterior landscape of prompts. Our method integrates a cyclical step-size schedule with a stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm, enabling alternating phases of exploration to discover new modes, and exploitation to refine existing modes. Furthermore, we introduce a repulsive force derived from a potential function over probability metrics (including Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) computed on the distributions of representations produced by different prompts. This representation-space repulsion diversifies exploration and prevents premature collapse to a single mode. Our approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of the prompt posterior distribution, leading to improved generalization. In contrast to prior Bayesian prompt learning methods, our method provides a modular plug-and-play Bayesian extension of any existing prompt learning method based on maximum likelihood estimation.

While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies. After reinforcement learning, our policy achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world graph structures and consistently outperforms the policy directly trained on the test graphs by the existing game RL approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u9c81\u68d2\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ffd\u6355\u7b56\u7565(R2PS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fdd\u6301\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u56fe\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8ffd\u9003\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ffd\u6355\u8005\u5728\u53ea\u6709\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u7528\u7684\u8ffd\u6355\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fe1\u606f\u573a\u666f\u4e14\u672a\u8003\u8651\u9003\u907f\u8005\u9884\u6d4b\u8ffd\u6355\u8005\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8bc1\u660e\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u6b65\u79fb\u52a8\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u9003\u907f\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fdd\u6301\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5d4c\u5165EPG\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u56fe\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u6297\u5f02\u6b65\u79fb\u52a8DP\u9003\u907f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6e38\u620f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "R2PS\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ffd\u6355\u7b56\u7565\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u56fe\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Coreset selection aims to accelerate training by identifying small, representative subsets of data that approximate the performance of the full dataset. Among various approaches, gradient based methods stand out due to their strong theoretical underpinnings and practical benefits, particularly under limited data budgets. However, these methods face challenges such as naive stochastic gradient descent (SGD) acting as a surprisingly strong baseline and the breakdown of representativeness due to loss curvature mismatches over time.\n  In this work, we propose a novel framework that addresses these limitations. First, we establish a connection between posterior sampling and loss landscapes, enabling robust coreset selection even in high data corruption scenarios.

Tanvir Alam"], "title": "DS-Span: Single-Phase Discriminative Subgraph Mining for Efficient Graph Embeddings", "comment": null, "summary": "Graph representation learning seeks to transform complex, high-dimensional graph structures into compact vector spaces that preserve both topology and semantics. Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning. Yet, existing frequent or discriminative subgraph mining approaches often suffer from redundant multi-phase pipelines, high computational cost, and weak coupling between mined structures and their discriminative relevance. We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that DS-Span generates more compact and discriminative subgraph features than prior multi-stage methods, achieving higher or comparable accuracy with significantly reduced runtime. These results highlight the potential of unified, single-phase discriminative mining as a foundation for scalable and interpretable graph representation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "DS-Span\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u5b50\u56fe\u6316\u6398\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u5f0f\u589e\u957f\u3001\u526a\u679d\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u9a71\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u904d\u5386\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9891\u7e41\u6216\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u5b50\u56fe\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6316\u6398\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5224\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDS-Span\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8986\u76d6\u4e0a\u9650\u8d44\u683c\u673a\u5236\uff08\u52a8\u6001\u9650\u5236\u63a2\u7d22\uff09\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u5f15\u5bfc\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5f3a\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u79bb\u80fd\u529b\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5197\u4f59\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5355\u6b21\u904d\u5386\u4e2d\u7edf\u4e00\u5b8c\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\u6316\u6398\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDS-Span\u6bd4\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u548c\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u6216\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration.

While recent prompt-based methods perform strongly in class-incremental settings, they remain vulnerable under domain shifts, where the input distribution changes but the label space remains fixed. This exposes a persistent problem known as representation drift. Shared representations evolve in ways that overwrite previously useful features and cause forgetting even when prompts isolate task-specific parameters. To address this issue, we introduce InTAct, a method that preserves functional behavior in shared layers without freezing parameters or storing past data. InTAct captures the characteristic activation ranges associated with previously learned tasks and constrains updates to ensure the network remains consistent within these regions, while still allowing for flexible adaptation elsewhere. In doing so, InTAct stabilizes the functional role of important neurons rather than directly restricting parameter values. The approach is architecture-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing prompt-based continual learning frameworks. By regulating representation changes where past knowledge is encoded, InTAct achieves a principled balance between stability and plasticity.

Submitted to Computers in Biology and Medicine", "summary": "Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is a cornerstone in biomolecular analysis, offering precise identification of pathogens through unique mass spectral signatures. Yet, its reliance on labor-intensive sample preparation and multi-shot spectral averaging restricts its use to laboratory settings, rendering it impractical for real-time environmental monitoring. These limitations are especially pronounced in emerging aerosol MALDI-MS systems, where autonomous sampling generates noisy spectra for unknown aerosol analytes, requiring single-shot detection for effective analysis. Addressing these challenges, we propose the Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer): a data-driven framework that redefines spectral analysis by directly processing raw, minimally prepared mass spectral data. MS-DGFormer leverages a transformer architecture, designed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in these time-series spectra. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce a novel dictionary encoder that integrates denoised spectral information derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), enabling the model to discern critical biomolecular patterns from single-shot spectra with robust performance. This innovation provides a system to achieve superior pathogen identification from aerosol samples, facilitating autonomous, real-time analysis in field conditions. By eliminating the need for extensive preprocessing, our method unlocks the potential for portable, deployable MALDI-MS platforms, revolutionizing environmental pathogen detection and rapid response to biological threats.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MS-DGFormer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u8d28\u8c31\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6c14\u6eb6\u80f6\u75c5\u539f\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMALDI-MS\u9700\u8981\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u6837\u54c1\u5236\u5907\u548c\u591a\u8c31\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u6c14\u6eb6\u80f6MALDI-MS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5355\u6b21\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u6355\u83b7\u8d28\u8c31\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u5b57\u5178\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6765\u6574\u5408\u53bb\u566a\u5149\u8c31\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u6b21\u5149\u8c31\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u6c14\u6eb6\u80f6\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u75c5\u539f\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5bf9\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fbf\u643a\u5f0f\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72MALDI-MS\u5e73\u53f0\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5f7b\u5e95\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u75c5\u539f\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u3002"}}

In our approach, the agent embodies the user's \"persona\" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge.
