*Rohith Reddy Vennam,Luke Wilson,Ish Kumar Jain,Dinesh Bharadia*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: ArrayLink是一种分布式相控阵架构，通过组合多个小型商用面板实现高增益波束成形，提升LEO卫星回传容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面站基础设施扩展滞后，导致LEO卫星回传容量瓶颈，传统抛物面天线不适合密集快速移动的LEO网络。

Method: 采用分布式相控阵架构，结合16个（32x32）面板，实现高增益波束成形和空间复用。

Result: ArrayLink在增益、并行流数量和距离方面表现优异，与理论和仿真结果高度一致。

Conclusion: ArrayLink为提升LEO回传容量提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has
revolutionized broadband access, earth observation, and direct-to-device
connectivity. However, the expansion of ground station infrastructure has not
kept pace, creating a critical bottleneck in satellite-to-ground backhaul
capacity. Traditional parabolic dish antennas, though effective for
geostationary (GEO) satellites, are ill-suited for dense, fastmoving LEO
networks due to mechanical steering delays and their inability to track
multiple satellites simultaneously. Phased array antennas offer electronically
steerable beams and multisatellite support, but their integration into ground
stations is limited by the high cost, hardware issues, and complexity of
achieving sufficient antenna gain. We introduce ArrayLink, a distributed phased
array architecture that coherently combines multiple small commercially
available panels to achieve high-gain beamforming and unlock line-of-sight MIMO
spatial multiplexing with minimal additional capital expenditure. By spacing 16
(32x32) panels across a kilometer-scale aperture, ArrayLink enters the
radiative near-field, focusing energy in both angle and range while supporting
up to four simultaneous spatial streams on a single feeder link. Through
rigorous theoretical analysis, detailed 2D beam pattern simulations and
real-world hardware experiments, we show that ArrayLink (i) achieves dish-class
gain with in range 1-2 dB of 1.47 m reflector, (ii) maintains four parallel
streams at ranges of hundreds of kilometers (falling to two beyond 2000 km),
and (iii) exhibits tight agreement across theory, simulation, and experiment
with minimal variance. These findings open a practical and scalable path to
boosting LEO backhaul capacity.

### [2] [RadioMamba: Breaking the Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-off in Radio Map Construction via a Hybrid Mamba-UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09140)
*Honggang Jia,Nan Cheng,Xiucheng Wang,Conghao Zhou,Ruijin Sun,Xuemin,Shen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: RadioMamba是一种混合Mamba-UNet架构，用于解决无线电地图构建中的精度与效率权衡问题，通过结合全局和局部特征提取，实现了更高的精度和更快的速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的无线电地图构建方法存在精度与效率的权衡问题，而准确的构建需要建模长距离空间依赖关系。

Method: RadioMamba采用Mamba-卷积块，Mamba分支以线性复杂度捕获全局依赖关系，卷积分支提取局部特征，结合全局与局部特征。

Result: 实验表明，RadioMamba比现有方法（包括扩散模型）精度更高，速度快近20倍，且仅使用2.9%的模型参数。

Conclusion: RadioMamba通过提升精度和效率，为下一代无线系统的实时智能优化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Radio map (RM) has recently attracted much attention since it can provide
real-time and accurate spatial channel information for 6G services and
applications. However, current deep learning-based methods for RM construction
exhibit well known accuracy-efficiency trade-off. In this paper, we introduce
RadioMamba, a hybrid Mamba-UNet architecture for RM construction to address the
trade-off. Generally, accurate RM construction requires modeling long-range
spatial dependencies, reflecting the global nature of wave propagation physics.
RadioMamba utilizes a Mamba-Convolutional block where the Mamba branch captures
these global dependencies with linear complexity, while a parallel
convolutional branch extracts local features. This hybrid design generates
feature representations that capture both global context and local detail.
Experiments show that RadioMamba achieves higher accuracy than existing
methods, including diffusion models, while operating nearly 20 times faster and
using only 2.9\% of the model parameters. By improving both accuracy and
efficiency, RadioMamba presents a viable approach for real-time intelligent
optimization in next generation wireless systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性感知的无线电地图重建框架（URAM），结合贝叶斯神经网络和注意力强化学习，优化无人机导航的覆盖范围和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空经济中，无线电地图对无人机无线连接至关重要，但电池容量限制了其覆盖和效率。

Method: 使用贝叶斯神经网络实时估计空间不确定性，结合注意力强化学习策略进行全局路径规划。

Result: URAM比现有基线重建精度提高34%。

Conclusion: URAM框架显著提升了无人机导航的效率和准确性。

Abstract: With the emergence of the low-altitude economy, radio maps have become
essential for ensuring reliable wireless connectivity to aerial platforms.
Autonomous aerial agents are commonly deployed for data collection using
waypoint-based navigation; however, their limited battery capacity
significantly constrains coverage and efficiency. To address this, we propose
an uncertainty-aware radio map (URAM) reconstruction framework that explicitly
leverages graph-based reasoning tailored for waypoint navigation. Our approach
integrates two key deep learning components: (1) a Bayesian neural network that
estimates spatial uncertainty in real time, and (2) an attention-based
reinforcement learning policy that performs global reasoning over a
probabilistic roadmap, using uncertainty estimates to plan informative and
energy-efficient trajectories. This graph-based reasoning enables intelligent,
non-myopic trajectory planning, guiding agents toward the most informative
regions while satisfying safety constraints. Experimental results show that
URAM improves reconstruction accuracy by up to 34% over existing baselines.

Motivation: 6G网络上行链路因设备资源限制和恶劣信道条件面临瓶颈，需创新解决方案。

Method: GenCom采用生成式AI模型在接收端重构信号，简化发射端的源和信道编码设计，支持语义保留压缩和语义感知重传。

Result: GenCom在低信噪比和不确定信道条件下表现优于传统系统。

Conclusion: GenCom为未来人本化、智能化和可持续无线网络提供了潜在解决方案，但仍需解决实际挑战。

Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks (6G) face a critical uplink bottleneck due
to stringent device-side resource constraints and challenging channel
conditions. This article introduces GenCom, a novel system-level paradigm for
robust 6G uplink that leverages Generative AI and exploits the inherent
resource imbalance between transmitters and receivers. In GenCom, resource-rich
receivers deploy powerful offline-trained GenAI models to reconstruct high
semantic-fidelity content from degraded signals, while resource-constrained
transmitters are simplified in both source and channel coding design. We
present the core mechanisms and key design principles behind GenCom, which
shifts from conventional approaches toward simple semantic-preserving
compression, weak error-distribution codes, and semantic-aware retransmissions.
Through a case study, GenCom is shown to deliver robust performance across a
wide range of low and uncertain SNR/SINR conditions where conventional systems
fail. Finally, we outline critical challenges and research directions toward
making GenCom a practical enabler of future human-centric, intelligent, and
sustainable wireless networks.

### [5] [Sub-THz Power Amplifiers: Measurements, Behavioral Modeling and Predistortion Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09545)
*Lutfi Samara,Simon Haussmann,Erind Tufa,Antonio Alberto D'Amico,Tommaso Zugno,Ingmar Kallfass,Thomas Kürner*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了太赫兹（THz）频段中功率放大器（PA）的非线性问题，提出了AM-AM和AM-PM模型，并设计了预失真算法以改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球IMT流量预计增长10-100倍，太赫兹频段成为满足需求的潜在解决方案，但宽带射频组件的非线性问题（如PA）影响了系统性能，尤其是高PAPR波形（如OFDM）。

Method: 通过小信号和大信号连续波测量，对300 GHz PA进行表征，建立AM-AM和AM-PM模型，并设计预失真算法。

Result: 模型验证了压缩行为，但低输入功率时存在频率依赖性误差。预失真算法在多载波波形切换时性能下降，但参数优化可显著改善性能。

Conclusion: 通过模型和预失真算法优化，可以显著提升太赫兹频段PA的性能，但需进一步解决低功率时的频率依赖性。

Abstract: With global IMT traffic expected to grow 10-100 times from 2020 to 20301, the
Terahertz (THz) spectrum offers a promising solution to satisfy such forecasts.
However, occupying the THz spectrum comes with its own challenges, an important
one being impairments caused by broadband RF components in THz transceivers.
Nonlinearities in power amplifiers (PAs) complicate meeting link budget
requirements, with amplitude and phase distortions degrading the system's
performance, especially when adopting waveforms with high peak-to-average power
ratios (PAPRs), such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). In
this paper, we present characterization results of a 300 GHz PA using
small-signal and large-signal continuous-wave measurements. Models capturing
Amplitude-to- Amplitude Modulation (AM-AM) and Amplitude-to-Phase Modulation
(AMPM) behavior across 270-330 GHz are developed and verified with wideband
measurements, confirming the compression behavior, while nonetheless showing
inaccuracies for low input powers due to unaccounted frequency dependencies.
Based on the derived models, a predistortion algorithm is designed and
analyzed, revealing significant error performance degradation when switching
between single- and multi-carrier waveforms. We finally show that an
appropriate selection of pre-distorter parameters can significantly improve the
performance.

Method: 设计了一种基于消息传递的定位方法，联合检测分布式单元的多径测量，实现低延迟定位。

Result: 该方法在定位性能上与多径定位方法相当，但延迟和计算复杂度更低。

Conclusion: 该方法为分布式MIMO系统提供了一种高效、低延迟的定位解决方案。

Abstract: Distributed MIMO and integrated sensing and communication are expected to be
key technologies in future wireless systems, enabling reliable, low-latency
communication and accurate localization. Dedicated localization solutions must
support distributed architecture, provide scalability across different system
configurations and meet strict latency requirements. We present a scalable
message-passing localization method and architecture co-designed for a
panel-based distributed MIMO system and network topology, in which
interconnected units operate without centralized processing. This method
jointly detects line-of-sight paths to distributed units from multipath
measurements in dynamic scenarios, localizes the agent, and achieves very low
latency. Additionally, we introduce a cycle-accurate system latency model based
on implemented FPGA operations, and show important insights into processing
latency and hardware utilization and system-level trade-offs. We compare our
method to a multipath-based localization method and show that it can achieve
similar localization performance, with wide enough distribution of array
elements, while offering lower latency and computational complexity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决高速数据平面中算子成本测量的精确性问题，避免侵入式工具的影响。

Method: 采用饱和吞吐量增量方法，捕捉非线性缩放行为，并引入算子性能象限（OPQ）框架对算子进行分类。

Result: 发现计算密集型算子（如CRC）表现出超线性行为，而大多数其他算子为次线性。揭示了Arm和x86架构之间的象限偏移。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了精确的、架构感知的瓶颈诊断，为性能建模和优化提供了现实基础。

Abstract: This paper proposes a saturation throughput delta-based methodology to
precisely measure operator costs in high-speed data planes without intrusive
instrumentation. The approach captures non-linear scaling, revealing that
compute-intensive operators like CRC exhibit super-linear behavior, while most
others are sub-linear. We introduce the Operator Performance Quadrant (OPQ)
framework to classify operators by base and scaling costs, exposing a
cross-architecture Quadrant Shift between Arm and x86. This method provides
accurate, architecture-aware bottleneck diagnosis and a realistic basis for
performance modeling and optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车队协同行驶（platooning）是V2X通信的重要应用，但需要高可靠性和低延迟的无线通信支持。本文旨在验证分布式资源分配方案（Mode 2d）是否能满足这些需求。

Method: 通过仿真评估分布式资源分配方案（Mode 2d），该方案允许车队从配置的资源池中选择资源，无需网络辅助。

Result: 仿真结果表明，Mode 2d能满足车队协同行驶的高可靠性、低延迟和数据速率需求。

Conclusion: 分布式资源分配方案（Mode 2d）是解决车队协同行驶通信挑战的有效方法。

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is a key technology for enabling
intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that can improve road safety, traffic
efficiency, and environmental sustainability. Among the various V2X
applications, platooning is one of the most promising ones, as it allows a
group of vehicles to travel closely together at high speeds, reducing fuel
consumption and emissions. However, it poses significant challenges for
wireless communication, such as high reliability and low latency. In this
paper, we evaluate the benefits of group scheduling, also referred to as Mode
2d, which is based on a distributed and scheduled resource allocation scheme
that allows the group of cars to select resources from a configured pool
without network assistance. We evaluated the scheme through simulations, and
the results show that this approach can meet the reliability, low latency, and
data rate requirements for platooning.

### [9] [CKFNet: Neural Network Aided Cubature Kalman filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09727)
*Jinhui Hu,Haiquan Zhao,Yi Peng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: CKFNet结合CKF和RNN，通过动态适应未建模的不确定性提升非线性估计性能，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CKF因模型与环境不匹配导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 在CKF预测阶段嵌入RNN模块，动态适应不确定性并减少误差传播。

Result: 实验显示CKFNet在准确性和鲁棒性上优于传统模型驱动方法和KalmanNet。

Conclusion: CKFNet通过结合模型驱动和数据驱动方法，显著提升了非线性估计性能。

Abstract: The cubature Kalman filter (CKF), while theoretically rigorous for nonlinear
estimation, often suffers performance degradation due to model-environment
mismatches in practice. To address this limitation, we propose CKFNet-a hybrid
architecture that synergistically integrates recurrent neural networks (RNN)
with the CKF framework while preserving its cubature principles. Unlike
conventional model-driven approaches, CKFNet embeds RNN modules in the
prediction phase to dynamically adapt to unmodeled uncertainties, effectively
reducing cumulative error propagation through temporal noise correlation
learning. Crucially, the architecture maintains CKF's analytical
interpretability via constrained optimization of cubature point distributions.
Numerical simulation experiments have confirmed that our proposed CKFNet
exhibits superior accuracy and robustness compared to conventional model-based
methods and existing KalmanNet algorithms.

### [10] [Online Data Generation for MIMO-OFDM Channel Denoising: Transfer Learning vs. Meta Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09751)
*Sungyoung Ha,Ikbeom Lee,Seunghyeon Jeon,Yo-Seb Jeon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于在线训练数据的标准兼容策略，用于动态适应信道去噪，利用数据辅助信道估计生成高质量信道估计，并通过转移学习和元学习两种方法显著降低信道估计误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统信道去噪技术需要先验知识或高训练开销的问题，适应动态信道条件。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方法能有效适应动态信道条件，显著降低信道估计误差。

Conclusion: 提出的策略和方法为动态信道条件下的高效去噪提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Channel denoising is a practical and effective technique for mitigating
channel estimation errors in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. However, adapting
denoising techniques to varying channel conditions typically requires prior
knowledge or incurs significant training overhead. To address these challenges,
we propose a standard-compatible strategy for generating online training data
that enables online adaptive channel denoising. The key idea is to leverage
high-quality channel estimates obtained via data-aided channel estimation as
practical substitutes for unavailable ground-truth channels. Our data-aided
method exploits adjacent detected data symbols within a specific time-frequency
neighborhood as virtual reference signals, and we analytically derive the
optimal size of this neighborhood to minimize the mean squared error of the
resulting estimates. By leveraging the proposed strategy, we devise two channel
denoising approaches, one based on transfer learning, which fine-tunes a
pre-trained denoising neural network, and the other based on meta learning,
which rapidly adapts to new channel environments with minimal updates.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively adapt to
dynamic channel conditions and significantly reduce channel estimation errors
compared to conventional techniques.

### [11] [Location Privacy-Enabled Beamforming in ISAC Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09882)
*Umair Ali Khan,Lester Ho,Holger Claussen,Chinmoy Kundu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方向到达混淆比（DAOR）的波束成形框架，用于保护ISAC场景中的发射机位置隐私，同时优化通信速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC技术虽然能同时实现环境感知和数据传输，但会暴露用户位置，因此需要保护发射机的位置隐私。

Method: 通过广义特征值分析推导DAOR的闭式边界，并在DAOR约束下构建速率最大化问题，使用半定松弛、特征模式选择和最优功率分配求解。

Result: 提出的DAOR波束成形在保护隐私的同时优化了通信速率，次优设计在10 dB SNR下计算时间减少85%。

Conclusion: DAOR框架在隐私保护和通信速率之间实现了平衡，且次优设计在性能损失较小的情况下显著降低了复杂度。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology enables simultaneous
environmental perception and data transmission in wireless networks; however,
it also exposes user location to receivers. In this paper, we introduce a novel
beamforming framework guided by the proposed privacy metric direction of
arrival obfuscation ratio (DAOR) to protect transmitter location privacy in
ISAC scenarios. Unlike previous approaches, we do not suppress the
line-of-sight (LOS) component while reshaping the angular power distribution so
that a false direction appears dominant at the receiver. We derive closed-form
bounds on the feasible DAOR via generalized eigenvalue analysis and formulate
an achievable rate-maximization problem under the DAOR constraint. The
resulting problem is non-convex, which is efficiently solved using semidefinite
relaxation, eigenmode selection, and optimal power allocation. A suboptimal
design strategy is also proposed with reduced complexity. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed DAOR-based beamformer achieves a trade-off
between location privacy and communication rate without nullifying the LOS
path. Results also show that a suboptimal design achieves a near-optimal
communication rate with nearly an 85% reduction in computation time at a
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB.

*Vaibhav Choudhary,Akshay Agarwal,Vivek K Goyal*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的二次电子成像模型，通过混合分布描述电子计数，显著提高了半导体边缘定位的分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积模型仅描述二次电子计数的均值，无法完全捕捉其分布特性，限制了分辨率提升。

Method: 采用混合分布模型，结合时间分辨测量（TRM）和最大似然估计（MLE），优化光束直径与扫描间距。

Result: 模拟实验显示MLE将边缘定位的均方根误差（RMSE）降低了5倍，实际HIM数据中平均降低5.4倍。

Conclusion: 混合分布模型和时间分辨测量显著提升了二次电子成像的分辨率，适用于半导体检测等应用。

Abstract: Secondary electron (SE) imaging techniques, such as scanning electron
microscopy and helium ion microscopy (HIM), use electrons emitted by a sample
in response to a focused beam of charged particles incident at a grid of raster
scan positions. Spot size -- the diameter of the incident beam's spatial
profile -- is one of the limiting factors for resolution, along with various
sources of noise in the SE signal. The effect of the beam spatial profile is
commonly understood as convolutional. We show that under a simple and plausible
physical abstraction for the beam, though convolution describes the mean of the
SE counts, the full distribution of SE counts is a mixture. We demonstrate that
this more detailed modeling can enable resolution improvements over
conventional estimators through a stylized application in semiconductor
inspection of localizing the edge in a two-valued sample. We derive Fisher
information about edge location in conventional and time-resolved measurements
(TRM) and also derive the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) from the latter.
Empirically, the MLE computed from TRM is approximately efficient except at
very low beam diameter, so Fisher information comparisons are predictive of
performance and can be used to optimize the beam diameter relative to the
raster scan spacing. Monte Carlo simulations show that the MLE gives a 5-fold
reduction in root mean-squared error (RMSE) of edge localization as compared to
conventional interpolation-based estimation. Applied to three real HIM
datasets, the average RMSE reduction factor is 5.4.

*Jinghong Tan,Zhian Liu,Kun Guo,Mingxiong Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于诚实拍卖的长期客户选择联邦学习方案（LCSFLA），以解决联邦学习中非独立同分布数据导致的模型收敛和准确性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在车联网（IoV）场景中，联邦学习面临非独立同分布数据、资源浪费和信息不对称等挑战，传统客户选择方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出LCSFLA方案，结合长期数据质量评估机制和拍卖机制，激励客户参与并确保信息真实性。

Result: 实验证明LCSFLA能有效缓解非独立同分布数据导致的性能下降，并验证了激励机制的兼容性和个体合理性。

Conclusion: LCSFLA为联邦学习在车联网等资源受限场景中的客户选择问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a decentralized framework that enables
universal model training through collaborative efforts on mobile nodes, such as
smart vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Each smart vehicle acts as a
mobile client, contributing to the process without uploading local data. This
method leverages non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) training
data from different vehicles, influenced by various driving patterns and
environmental conditions, which can significantly impact model convergence and
accuracy. Although client selection can be a feasible solution for non-IID
issues, it faces challenges related to selection metrics. Traditional metrics
evaluate client data quality independently per round and require client
selection after all clients complete local training, leading to resource
wastage from unused training results. In the IoV context, where vehicles have
limited connectivity and computational resources, information asymmetry in
client selection risks clients submitting false information, potentially making
the selection ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Long-term Client-Selection Federated Learning based on Truthful Auction
(LCSFLA). This scheme maximizes social welfare with consideration of long-term
data quality using a new assessment mechanism and energy costs, and the advised
auction mechanism with a deposit requirement incentivizes client participation
and ensures information truthfulness. We theoretically prove the incentive
compatibility and individual rationality of the advised incentive mechanism.
Experimental results on various datasets, including those from IoV scenarios,
demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating performance degradation caused by
non-IID data.

### [14] [Efficient Real-Time Aircraft ETA Prediction via Feature Tokenization Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09144)
*Liping Huang,Yicheng Zhang,Yifang Yin,Sheng Zhang,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于特征标记化的Transformer模型，用于实时预测飞机到达时间（ETA），在准确性和效率上均优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时ETA预测对于航空到达管理至关重要，尤其是在跑道排序中。研究旨在提高预测效率和准确性。

Method: 利用特征标记化将原始输入投影到潜在空间，并通过Transformer的多头自注意力机制捕获关键信息，避免了复杂的特征工程。模型支持高频（1HZ）并行计算。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比XGBoost模型准确率提高7%，计算时间仅需39%。在40架飞机同时运行时，推断时间仅为51.7微秒。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且准确，适用于实时到达管理系统。

Abstract: Estimated time of arrival (ETA) for airborne aircraft in real-time is crucial
for arrival management in aviation, particularly for runway sequencing. Given
the rapidly changing airspace context, the ETA prediction efficiency is as
important as its accuracy in a real-time arrival aircraft management system. In
this study, we utilize a feature tokenization-based Transformer model to
efficiently predict aircraft ETA. Feature tokenization projects raw inputs to
latent spaces, while the multi-head self-attention mechanism in the Transformer
captures important aspects of the projections, alleviating the need for complex
feature engineering. Moreover, the Transformer's parallel computation
capability allows it to handle ETA requests at a high frequency, i.e., 1HZ,
which is essential for a real-time arrival management system. The model inputs
include raw data, such as aircraft latitude, longitude, ground speed, theta
degree for the airport, day and hour from track data, the weather context, and
aircraft wake turbulence category. With a data sampling rate of 1HZ, the ETA
prediction is updated every second. We apply the proposed aircraft ETA
prediction approach to Singapore Changi Airport (ICAO Code: WSSS) using
one-month Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data from October
1 to October 31, 2022. In the experimental evaluation, the ETA modeling covers
all aircraft within a range of 10NM to 300NM from WSSS. The results show that
our proposed method method outperforms the commonly used boosting tree based
model, improving accuracy by 7\% compared to XGBoost, while requiring only 39\%
of its computing time. Experimental results also indicate that, with 40
aircraft in the airspace at a given timestamp, the ETA inference time is only
51.7 microseconds, making it promising for real-time arrival management
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoLAN是一个多模态感知的动态噪声编辑框架，通过分块处理模态特征并动态分配去噪强度，有效抑制噪声同时保留关键信息。MoLAN+在此基础上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析常因无关或误导性信息而受限，现有方法通常以整个模态为单位处理，可能导致关键信息丢失。

Method: MoLAN将每个模态特征分块，根据噪声水平和语义相关性动态分配去噪强度，实现细粒度噪声抑制。

Result: 在五个模型和四个数据集上的实验表明，MoLAN框架广泛有效，MoLAN+达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MoLAN框架灵活统一，可无缝集成到多模态模型中，显著提升多模态情感分析性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis aims to integrate information from various
modalities, such as audio, visual, and text, to make complementary predictions.
However, it often struggles with irrelevant or misleading visual and auditory
information. Most existing approaches typically treat the entire modality
information (e.g., a whole image, audio segment, or text paragraph) as an
independent unit for feature enhancement or denoising. They often suppress the
redundant and noise information at the risk of losing critical information. To
address this challenge, we propose MoLAN, a unified ModaLity-aware noise
dynAmic editiNg framework. Specifically, MoLAN performs modality-aware blocking
by dividing the features of each modality into multiple blocks. Each block is
then dynamically assigned a distinct denoising strength based on its noise
level and semantic relevance, enabling fine-grained noise suppression while
preserving essential multimodal information. Notably, MoLAN is a unified and
flexible framework that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of
multimodal models. Building upon this framework, we further introduce MoLAN+, a
new multimodal sentiment analysis approach. Experiments across five models and
four datasets demonstrate the broad effectiveness of the MoLAN framework.
Extensive evaluations show that MoLAN+ achieves the state-of-the-art
performance. The code is publicly available at

### [16] [To Theoretically Understand Transformer-Based In-Context Learning for Optimizing CSMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09146)
*Shugang Hao,Hongbo Li,Lingjie Duan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM transformer的上下文学习（ICL）理论，用于优化WiFi 7中的信道访问，解决了动态信道环境下节点密度估计不准确导致的吞吐量损失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于模型的退避策略（如非持久和p-持久CSMA）在已知固定节点密度下优化，但在动态环境下因节点密度估计不准确导致吞吐量损失较大。

Method: 设计了基于transformer的ICL优化器，通过预收集碰撞阈值数据示例和查询碰撞案例构建输入提示，生成预测的竞争窗口阈值（CWT）。训练中开发了高效算法，保证在有限训练步骤内接近最优的CWT预测。

Result: 实验证明该方法在未知节点密度下比现有基于模型和深度强化学习的方法具有更快的收敛速度和接近最优的吞吐量。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在动态信道环境下显著提升了吞吐量性能，且对输入数据中的错误具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: The binary exponential backoff scheme is widely used in WiFi 7 and still
incurs poor throughput performance under dynamic channel environments. Recent
model-based approaches (e.g., non-persistent and $p$-persistent CSMA) simply
optimize backoff strategies under a known and fixed node density, still leading
to a large throughput loss due to inaccurate node density estimation. This
paper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL)
theory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL
optimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query
collision case. They are constructed as a prompt as the input for the
transformer to learn the pattern, which then generates a predicted contention
window threshold (CWT). To train the transformer for effective ICL, we develop
an efficient algorithm and guarantee a near-optimal CWT prediction within
limited training steps. As it may be hard to gather perfect data examples for
ICL in practice, we further extend to allow erroneous data input in the prompt.
We prove that our optimizer maintains minimal prediction and throughput
deviations from the optimal values. Experimental results on NS-3 further
demonstrate our approach's fast convergence and near-optimal throughput over
existing model-based and DRL-based approaches under unknown node densities.

Motivation: 为了解决嵌入空间中时间锚定的问题，并提供一个统一的数学框架，以支持对漂移和投影操作的严格分析。

Abstract: We develop an operator-theoretic framework for temporal anchoring in
embedding spaces, modeled as drift maps interleaved with event-indexed blocks
culminating in affine projections. We provide complete proofs for a

ontological convergence under nested affine anchors with a robustness variant.
We formalize an internal Manuscript Computer (MC) whose computations are
defined purely by these operators and prove a rigorous finite-run equivalence
theorem (with perturbation bounds). For attention layers, we give a
self-contained proof that softmax is $1/2$-Lipschitz in $\ell_2$ and derive
sufficient layer-contraction conditions (orthogonal/non-orthogonal heads). All
floats are placed exactly where written; the manuscript uses only in-paper

TL;DR: 论文质疑复杂序列混合器在时间序列分析中的必要性，提出用密集层替代序列混合器的JustDense方法，实验表明其性能相当或更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨复杂序列混合器（如注意力机制）是否真的必要，发现其优势可能来自其他因素，而非混合器本身。

Method: 提出JustDense方法，用密集层替代序列混合器，基于MatrixMixer框架进行理论分析。

Result: 在29个基准测试中，密集层替代序列混合器的性能相当或更优，挑战了复杂架构必然更好的假设。

Conclusion: 复杂序列混合器在时间序列分析中并非必需，简单架构可能更有效。

Abstract: Sequence and channel mixers, the core mechanism in sequence models, have
become the de facto standard in time series analysis (TSA). However, recent
studies have questioned the necessity of complex sequence mixers, such as
attention mechanisms, demonstrating that simpler architectures can achieve
comparable or even superior performance. This suggests that the benefits
attributed to complex sequencemixers might instead emerge from other
architectural or optimization factors. Based on this observation, we pose a
central question: Are common sequence mixers necessary for time-series
analysis? Therefore, we propose JustDense, an empirical study that
systematically replaces sequence mixers in various well-established TSA models
with dense layers. Grounded in the MatrixMixer framework, JustDense treats any
sequence mixer as a mixing matrix and replaces it with a dense layer. This
substitution isolates the mixing operation, enabling a clear theoretical
foundation for understanding its role. Therefore, we conducted extensive
experiments on 29 benchmarks covering five representative TSA tasks using seven
state-of-the-art TSA models to address our research question. The results show
that replacing sequence mixers with dense layers yields comparable or even
superior performance. In the cases where dedicated sequence mixers still offer
benefits, JustDense challenges the assumption that "deeper and more complex
architectures are inherently better" in TSA.

Motivation: 估计复杂社交网络中的同伴因果效应具有挑战性，主要由于同伴间的同时反馈和未观察混杂因素。现有方法无法同时解决这两个问题。

Method: DIG2RSI结合I-G变换和2SRI技术，分两阶段处理：第一阶段用神经网络预测同伴暴露并提取残差；第二阶段用对抗性判别器控制混杂信号。

Result: DIG2RSI在半合成基准和真实数据集上表现优于现有方法，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: DIG2RSI通过深度学习和对抗性去偏技术，成功解决了同时反馈和未观察混杂问题，为同伴效应估计提供了新方法。

Abstract: Estimating peer causal effects within complex real-world networks such as
social networks is challenging, primarily due to simultaneous feedback between
peers and unobserved confounders. Existing methods either address unobserved
confounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback
but under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer
effect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning
framework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an
instrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback
and unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and
high-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to
disentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the
simultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct
valid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on
these IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the
unobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network
augmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as
a control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no
residual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in
capturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances
the effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and
hidden confounders. We prove consistency of our estimator under standard
regularity conditions, ensuring asymptotic recovery of the true peer effect.
Empirical results on two semi-synthetic benchmarks and a real-world dataset
demonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches.

Result: 在8个基准测试和多种模型上，AdaPO显著提升了直接推理和自我评估能力。

Conclusion: AdaPO框架通过自适应机制有效解决了奖励黑客问题，为模型自我改进提供了新方向。

Abstract: Self-evaluation, a model's ability to assess the correctness of its own
output, is crucial for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to achieve
self-improvement in multi-turn conversations, yet largely absent in foundation
models. Recent work has employed reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
self-evaluation; however, its fixed reward mechanism suffers from reward
hacking when optimizing multiple training objectives, leading to model
collapse. In this paper we propose AdaPO, an online reinforcement learning
framework capable of adaptively adjusting training objective in real time
according to the current training state for each task. Specifically, to
mitigate reward hacking , AdaPO introduces an Adaptive Reward Model (ARM) and a
Reward Aware Dynamic KL Regularization mechanism. ARM assesses the task's
training state from the distribution of model generated multi-turn
trajectories' performance. Reward Aware Dynamic KL replaces a fixed penalty
with dynamic coefficients which is modulated by the reward gap between
different multi-turn situations. Notably, our method automatically and smoothly
adjusts its learning focus based on sub-tasks' training progress without manual
intervention. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks and various models show
that our method significantly enhances both direct reasoning and
self-evaluation capability. We will release our code to contribute to the
community.

Abstract: We present a framework for fine-tuning flow-matching generative models to
enforce physical constraints and solve inverse problems in scientific systems.
Starting from a model trained on low-fidelity or observational data, we apply a
differentiable post-training procedure that minimizes weak-form residuals of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs), promoting physical consistency
and adherence to boundary conditions without distorting the underlying learned
distribution. To infer unknown physical inputs, such as source terms, material
parameters, or boundary data, we augment the generative process with a
learnable latent parameter predictor and propose a joint optimization strategy.
The resulting model produces physically valid field solutions alongside
plausible estimates of hidden parameters, effectively addressing ill-posed
inverse problems in a data-driven yet physicsaware manner. We validate our
method on canonical PDE benchmarks, demonstrating improved satisfaction of PDE
constraints and accurate recovery of latent coefficients. Our approach bridges
generative modelling and scientific inference, opening new avenues for
simulation-augmented discovery and data-efficient modelling of physical
systems.

Conclusion: EvaDrive提供了一种无标量化的轨迹优化方法，通过动态权重生成多样驾驶风格，为自动驾驶决策提供了新思路。

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces significant challenges in achieving human-like
iterative decision-making, which continuously generates, evaluates, and refines
trajectory proposals. Current generation-evaluation frameworks isolate
trajectory generation from quality assessment, preventing iterative refinement
essential for planning, while reinforcement learning methods collapse
multi-dimensional preferences into scalar rewards, obscuring critical
trade-offs and yielding scalarization bias.To overcome these issues, we present
EvaDrive, a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that
establishes genuine closed-loop co-evolution between trajectory generation and
evaluation via adversarial optimization. EvaDrive frames trajectory planning as
a multi-round adversarial game. In this game, a hierarchical generator
continuously proposes candidate paths by combining autoregressive intent
modeling for temporal causality with diffusion-based refinement for spatial
flexibility. These proposals are then rigorously assessed by a trainable
multi-objective critic that explicitly preserves diverse preference structures
without collapsing them into a single scalarization bias.This adversarial
interplay, guided by a Pareto frontier selection mechanism, enables iterative
multi-round refinement, effectively escaping local optima while preserving
trajectory diversity.Extensive experiments on NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks
demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving 94.9 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 (surpassing
DiffusionDrive by 6.8, DriveSuprim by 5.0, and TrajHF by 0.9) and 64.96 Driving
Score on Bench2Drive. EvaDrive generates diverse driving styles via dynamic
weighting without external preference data, introducing a closed-loop
adversarial framework for human-like iterative decision-making, offering a
novel scalarization-free trajectory optimization approach.

Motivation: 1型糖尿病（T1D）患者依赖胰岛素注射，但胰岛素可能导致低血糖，严重时危及生命。现有研究因缺乏大规模数据受限，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 系统整合15个数据集，形成包含血糖和心率数据的数据库，并评估数据质量。进一步分析血糖与心率的相关性。

Result: 创建了包含1.49亿次测量的数据库，其中4%为低血糖数据。发现血糖与心率在低血糖前15至55分钟存在相关性。

Conclusion: 整合的数据集为糖尿病研究提供了重要资源，数据质量和相关性分析为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder that leads to the destruction
of insulin-producing cells, resulting in insulin deficiency, as to why the
affected individuals depend on external insulin injections. However, insulin
can decrease blood glucose levels and can cause hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a
severe event of low blood glucose levels ($\le$70 mg/dL) with dangerous side
effects of dizziness, coma, or death. Data analysis can significantly enhance
diabetes care by identifying personal patterns and trends leading to adverse
events. Especially, machine learning (ML) models can predict glucose levels and
provide early alarms. However, diabetes and hypoglycemia research is limited by
the unavailability of large datasets. Thus, this work systematically integrates
15 datasets to provide a large database of 2510 subjects with glucose
measurements recorded every 5 minutes. In total, 149 million measurements are
included, of which 4% represent values in the hypoglycemic range. Moreover, two
sub-databases are extracted. Sub-database I includes demographics, and
sub-database II includes heart rate data. The integrated dataset provides an
equal distribution of sex and different age levels. As a further contribution,
data quality is assessed, revealing that data imbalance and missing values
present a significant challenge. Moreover, a correlation study on glucose
levels and heart rate data is conducted, showing a relation between 15 and 55
minutes before hypoglycemia.

Abstract: Accurate energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient resource
management and sustainability in the building sector. Deep learning models are
highly successful but struggle with limited historical data and become unusable
when historical data are unavailable, such as in newly constructed buildings.
On the other hand, physics-based models, such as EnergyPlus, simulate energy
consumption without relying on historical data but require extensive building
parameter specifications and considerable time to model a building. This paper
introduces a Physics-Guided Memory Network (PgMN), a neural network that
integrates predictions from deep learning and physics-based models to address
their limitations. PgMN comprises a Parallel Projection Layers to process
incomplete inputs, a Memory Unit to account for persistent biases, and a Memory
Experience Module to optimally extend forecasts beyond their input range and
produce output. Theoretical evaluation shows that components of PgMN are
mathematically valid for performing their respective tasks. The PgMN was
evaluated on short-term energy forecasting at an hourly resolution, critical
for operational decision-making in smart grid and smart building systems.
Experimental validation shows accuracy and applicability of PgMN in diverse
scenarios such as newly constructed buildings, missing data, sparse historical
data, and dynamic infrastructure changes. This paper provides a promising
solution for energy consumption forecasting in dynamic building environments,
enhancing model applicability in scenarios where historical data are limited or
unavailable or when physics-based models are inadequate.

Abstract: Next generation advanced nuclear reactors are expected to be smaller both in
size and power output, relying extensively on fully digital instrumentation and
control systems. These reactors will generate a large flow of information in
the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non
linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states.
Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly
important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable
operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus
on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further
identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition,
these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian
process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to
univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other
linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled
system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems,
additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and
explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised
explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized
windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e.,
detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity
during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was
benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1
with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI
framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals
being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better
accuracy.

Abstract: Stochastic computing (SC) has emerged as an efficient low-power alternative
for deploying neural networks (NNs) in resource-limited scenarios, such as the
Internet of Things (IoT). By encoding values as serial bitstreams, SC
significantly reduces energy dissipation compared to conventional
floating-point (FP) designs; however, further improvement of layer-wise
mixed-precision implementation for SC remains unexplored. This article
introduces Adjustable Sequence Length (ASL), a novel scheme that applies
mixed-precision concepts specifically to SC NNs. By introducing an
operator-norm-based theoretical model, this article shows that truncation noise
can cumulatively propagate through the layers by the estimated amplification
factors. An extended sensitivity analysis is presented, using random forest
(RF) regression to evaluate multilayer truncation effects and validate the
alignment of theoretical predictions with practical network behaviors. To
accommodate different application scenarios, this article proposes two
truncation strategies (coarse-grained and fine-grained), which apply diverse
sequence length configurations at each layer. Evaluations on a pipelined SC MLP
synthesized at 32nm demonstrate that ASL can reduce energy and latency
overheads by up to over 60% with negligible accuracy loss. It confirms the
feasibility of the ASL scheme for IoT applications and highlights the distinct
advantages of mixed-precision truncation in SC designs.

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical task that involves generating synthetic
yet realistic representations of populations. It is a fundamental problem in
agent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze
intelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the
primary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents
represented by population members. However, when the number of attributes
describing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the
joint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of
dimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and
produce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from
available sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute
combinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the
sample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of
falsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in
the population (called structural zeros). In this study, a novel diffusion
model-based population synthesis method is proposed to estimate the underlying
joint distribution of a population. This approach enables the recovery of
numerous missing sampling zeros while keeping the generated structural zeros
minimal. Our method is compared with other recently proposed approaches such as
Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
approaches, which have shown success in high dimensional tabular population
synthesis. We assess the performance of the synthesized outputs using a range
of metrics, including marginal distribution similarity, feasibility, and
diversity. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms
previous approaches in achieving a better balance between the feasibility and

Motivation: 不同医院的ECG布局差异导致信号异步和部分缺失，现有模型难以应对这一挑战。

Method: 提出PatchECG框架，基于掩码训练策略，自适应学习关键块，实现不同布局ECG的关键识别。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集和真实ECG图像上，AUROC达0.835，外部验证中房颤诊断AUROC为0.778，优于经典方法和ECGFounder模型。

Conclusion: PatchECG在多种ECG布局下表现稳定且优越，为心律失常诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) as an important tool for diagnosing cardiovascular
diseases such as arrhythmia. Due to the differences in ECG layouts used by
different hospitals, the digitized signals exhibit asynchronous lead time and
partial blackout loss, which poses a serious challenge to existing models. To
address this challenge, the study introduced PatchECG, a framework for adaptive
variable block count missing representation learning based on a masking
training strategy, which automatically focuses on key patches with
collaborative dependencies between leads, thereby achieving key recognition of
arrhythmia in ECGs with different layouts. Experiments were conducted on the
PTB-XL dataset and 21388 asynchronous ECG images generated using ECG image kit
tool, using the 23 Subclasses as labels. The proposed method demonstrated
strong robustness under different layouts, with average Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.835 and remained stable (unchanged
with layout changes). In external validation based on 400 real ECG images data
from Chaoyang Hospital, the AUROC for atrial fibrillation diagnosis reached
0.778; On 12 x 1 layout ECGs, AUROC reaches 0.893. This result is superior to
various classic interpolation and baseline methods, and compared to the current
optimal large-scale pre-training model ECGFounder, it has improved by 0.111 and
0.19.

Conclusion: SVGen为SVG生成提供了高效解决方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is widely used in front-end development and
UI/UX design due to its scalability, editability, and rendering efficiency.
However, turning creative ideas into precise vector graphics remains a
time-consuming challenge. To address this, we introduce SVG-1M, a large-scale

advanced data augmentation and annotation, we create well-aligned Text to SVG
training pairs, including a subset with Chain of Thought annotations for
enhanced semantic guidance. Based on this dataset, we propose SVGen, an
end-to-end model that generates SVG code from natural language inputs. Our
approach ensures semantic accuracy and structural completeness, supported by
curriculum learning and reinforcement learning optimization. Experiments show
that SVGen outperforms general large models and traditional rendering methods
in both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and dataset are available on

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了模态间隙问题，且无需昂贵训练，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Textual descriptions for multimodal inputs entail recurrent refinement of
queries to produce relevant output images. Despite efforts to address
challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with
pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large
multimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a
misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common
embedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is
typically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive
domain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight
training-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend
across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently.
During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling
retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set. These textual
descriptions, in conjunction with an instruction, cater as an input prompt for
the language model to generate new textual descriptions. In addition, we
introduce an iterative technique for distilling the mapping by generating
synthetic descriptions via the language model facilitating optimisation for
standard utilised image description measures. Experimental results on two
benchmark multimodal datasets demonstrate significant improvements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中非独立同分布数据导致的模型收敛和性能问题，尤其在医学影像领域。

Method: 使用随机特征流形补全和类原型对齐，优化客户端特征流形的一致性。

Result: 在多个医学影像和自然图像数据集上表现优于现有联邦学习算法。

Conclusion: FedMP有效解决了非独立同分布数据的挑战，提升了联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm in which
multiple clients collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their
local private data. However, real-world applications of FL frequently encounter
challenges arising from the non-identically and independently distributed
(non-IID) local datasets across participating clients, which is particularly
pronounced in the field of medical imaging, where shifts in image feature
distributions significantly hinder the global model's convergence and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedMP, a novel method
designed to enhance FL under non-IID scenarios. FedMP employs stochastic
feature manifold completion to enrich the training space of individual client
classifiers, and leverages class-prototypes to guide the alignment of feature
manifolds across clients within semantically consistent subspaces, facilitating
the construction of more distinct decision boundaries. We validate the
effectiveness of FedMP on multiple medical imaging datasets, including those
with real-world multi-center distributions, as well as on a multi-domain
natural image dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that FedMP
outperforms existing FL algorithms. Additionally, we analyze the impact of
manifold dimensionality, communication efficiency, and privacy implications of
feature exposure in our method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为动态量化训练（DQT）的新框架，通过嵌套整数表示和自定义整数运算，实现了高效的动态量化，避免了传统方法中昂贵的浮点运算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态量化方法需要昂贵的浮点运算来切换精度，破坏了整数硬件范式并影响性能。DQT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DQT采用嵌套整数表示和自定义整数运算，通过低成本位移操作实现动态精度切换。

Result: 在ImageNet上，4位动态ResNet50达到77.00% top-1准确率，优于现有静态和动态方法。

Conclusion: DQT通过高效动态量化，为资源受限设备上的AI部署开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices relies
on quantization. While static, uniform quantization applies a fixed bit-width
to all inputs, it fails to adapt to their varying complexity. Dynamic,
instance-based mixed-precision quantization promises a superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-off by allocating higher precision only when needed.
However, a critical bottleneck remains: existing methods require a costly
dequantize-to-float and requantize-to-integer cycle to change precision,
breaking the integer-only hardware paradigm and compromising performance gains.
This paper introduces Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT), a novel framework
that removes this bottleneck. At the core of DQT is a nested integer
representation where lower-precision values are bit-wise embedded within
higher-precision ones. This design, coupled with custom integer-only
arithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost
bit-shift operation. This makes DQT the first quantization framework to enable
both dequantization-free static mixed-precision of the backbone network, and
truly efficient dynamic, instance-based quantization through a lightweight
controller that decides at runtime how to quantize each layer. We demonstrate
DQT state-of-the-art performance on ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 and ResNet50 on
ImageNet. On ImageNet, our 4-bit dynamic ResNet50 achieves 77.00% top-1
accuracy, an improvement over leading static (LSQ, 76.70%) and dynamic (DQNET,
76.94%) methods at a comparable BitOPs budget. Crucially, DQT achieves this
with a bit-width transition cost of only 28.3M simple bit-shift operations, a
drastic improvement over the 56.6M costly Multiply-Accumulate (MAC)
floating-point operations required by previous dynamic approaches - unlocking a
new frontier in efficient, adaptive AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序数据的高维性和稀疏性使传统聚类方法面临统计和计算挑战，现有图神经网络方法依赖静态图结构，对噪声敏感且难以捕捉长尾分布。

Method: scAGC结合拓扑自适应图自编码器和可微分Gumbel-Softmax采样策略，动态优化图结构，同时使用ZINB损失和对比学习目标增强鲁棒性和稳定性。

Result: 在9个真实数据集上，scAGC在NMI和ARI指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: scAGC通过自适应图学习和对比指导，显著提升了单细胞聚类性能，适用于复杂数据分布。

Abstract: Accurate cell type annotation is a crucial step in analyzing single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, which provides valuable insights into cellular
heterogeneity. However, due to the high dimensionality and prevalence of zero
elements in scRNA-seq data, traditional clustering methods face significant
statistical and computational challenges. While some advanced methods use graph
neural networks to model cell-cell relationships, they often depend on static
graph structures that are sensitive to noise and fail to capture the
long-tailed distribution inherent in single-cell populations.To address these
limitations, we propose scAGC, a single-cell clustering method that learns
adaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance. Our approach optimizes feature
representations and cell graphs simultaneously in an end-to-end manner.
Specifically, we introduce a topology-adaptive graph autoencoder that leverages
a differentiable Gumbel-Softmax sampling strategy to dynamically refine the
graph structure during training. This adaptive mechanism mitigates the problem
of a long-tailed degree distribution by promoting a more balanced neighborhood
structure. To model the discrete, over-dispersed, and zero-inflated nature of
scRNA-seq data, we integrate a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) loss for
robust feature reconstruction. Furthermore, a contrastive learning objective is
incorporated to regularize the graph learning process and prevent abrupt
changes in the graph topology, ensuring stability and enhancing convergence.
Comprehensive experiments on 9 real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that scAGC
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, yielding the best NMI
and ARI scores on 9 and 7 datasets, respectively.Our code is available at
Anonymous Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调大型语言模型（LLM）可能破坏原始对齐机制并引入安全风险，现有防御方法缺乏对安全层和细粒度神经元的综合考虑。

Method: 提出FGSN方法，结合安全层与神经元的多尺度交互，定位稀疏且精确的安全神经元，并通过投影技术提升模型安全性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著降低有害性评分和攻击成功率，同时保持模型实用性。

Conclusion: FGSN通过任务特异性优化机制，实现了对未知安全问题的持续防御和泛化能力。

Abstract: Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language
models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and
introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for
the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most
post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These
methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and
fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and
utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN)
with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety
risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety
layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety
neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then
project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model
safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive
experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method
significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal
parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by
introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron
cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization
capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.

TL;DR: TokenCast是一个基于LLM的框架，通过语言符号表示实现上下文感知的时间序列预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决历史数值序列与上下文特征（如非结构化文本数据）融合的挑战，提升预测准确性。

Result: 在多样化真实数据集上验证了TokenCast的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: TokenCast通过统一语义空间和LLM优化，显著提升了上下文感知时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in supporting decision-making
across a wide range of critical applications, including energy, healthcare, and
finance. Despite recent advances, forecasting accuracy remains limited due to
the challenge of integrating historical numerical sequences with contextual
features, which often comprise unstructured textual data. To address this
challenge, we propose TokenCast, an LLM-driven framework that leverages
language-based symbolic representations as a unified intermediary for
context-aware time series forecasting. Specifically, TokenCast employs a
discrete tokenizer to transform continuous numerical sequences into temporal
tokens, enabling structural alignment with language-based inputs. To bridge the
semantic gap between modalities, both temporal and contextual tokens are
embedded into a shared representation space via a pre-trained large language
model (LLM), further optimized with autoregressive generative objectives.
Building upon this unified semantic space, the aligned LLM is subsequently
fine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are
then decoded back into the original numerical space. Extensive experiments on
diverse real-world datasets enriched with contextual features demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of TokenCast.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源dLLMs在推理速度上未能超越类似规模的自回归（AR）LLMs，因此需要一种更高效的策略。

Method: D2F通过块级自回归生成和跨块并行解码，结合非对称蒸馏和流水线并行解码算法，优化推理效率。

Result: 实验显示，D2F dLLMs在GSM8K上的推理速度比LLaMA3和Qwen2.5快2.5倍以上，比传统dLLMs快50倍以上，同时保持输出质量。

Conclusion: D2F策略成功提升了dLLMs的推理效率，为文本生成提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for text generation, with the potential
to decode multiple tokens in a single iteration. However, none of the existing
open-source dLLMs have achieved superior inference speed over AR LLMs of
similar size. This paper breaks this barrier based on a simple and effective
strategy named discrete diffusion forcing (D2F). D2F equips dLLMs with two key
capabilities: (1) block-wise autoregressive generation to enable KV cache
utilization; (2) prediction of following tokens without requiring completion of
prior blocks for inter-block parallel decoding. In this way, the vanilla dLLMs
are refurbished into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm for efficient inference.
D2F can be implemented with an asymmetric distillation process based on
pre-trained dLLMs. We further propose a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm,
which enables a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy. Empirically, D2F
dLLMs achieve more than $\mathbf{2.5\times}$ inference speed than LLaMA3 and
Qwen2.5 on GSM8K. Compared to vanilla dLLMs like LLaDA and Dream, the
acceleration can be more than $\mathbf{50\times}$ while maintaining comparable
output quality. The code is available at

Conclusion: MIPCGRL能处理复杂指令，实现更灵活、表达力更强的内容生成。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative modeling emphasize the importance of
natural language as a highly expressive and accessible modality for controlling
content generation. However, existing instructed reinforcement learning for
procedural content generation (IPCGRL) method often struggle to leverage the
expressive richness of textual input, especially under complex, multi-objective
instructions, leading to limited controllability. To address this problem, we
propose \textit{MIPCGRL}, a multi-objective representation learning method for
instructed content generators, which incorporates sentence embeddings as
conditions. MIPCGRL effectively trains a multi-objective embedding space by
incorporating multi-label classification and multi-head regression networks.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves up to a 13.8\%
improvement in controllability with multi-objective instructions. The ability
to process complex instructions enables more expressive and flexible content
generation.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale models, such as large language models (LLMs),
incurs substantial costs due to their computational demands. To mitigate these
costs and address challenges related to scalability and data security, there is
a growing shift towards decentralized systems for model deployment, where
choosing efficient inference acceleration schemes become crucial to manage
computational resources effectively and enhance system responsiveness. In this
work, we address the challenge of selecting optimal acceleration methods in
decentralized systems by introducing a meta-learning-based framework. This
framework automates the selection process by learning from historical
performance data of various acceleration techniques across different tasks.
Unlike traditional methods that rely on random selection or expert intuition,
our approach systematically identifies the best acceleration strategies based
on the specific characteristics of each task. We demonstrate that our
meta-learning framework not only streamlines the decision-making process but
also consistently outperforms conventional methods in terms of efficiency and
performance. Our results highlight the potential of inference acceleration in
decentralized AI systems, offering a path towards more democratic and

Conclusion: ADT4Coupons能有效提升长期收入，适用于多种营销场景。

Abstract: Coupon distribution is a critical marketing strategy used by online platforms
to boost revenue and enhance user engagement. Regrettably, existing coupon
distribution strategies fall far short of effectively leveraging the complex
sequential interactions between platforms and users. This critical oversight,
despite the abundance of e-commerce log data, has precipitated a performance
plateau. In this paper, we focus on the scene that the platforms make
sequential coupon distribution decision multiple times for various users, with
each user interacting with the platform repeatedly. Based on this marketing
scenario, we propose a novel marketing framework, named Aligned Decision
Transformer for Coupons (ADT4Coupons), to directly devise coupon distribution
policy for long-term revenue boosting. ADT4Coupons enables optimized online
decision-making in a variety of real-world marketing scenarios. It achieves
this by seamlessly integrating three key characteristics, general scenarios,
sequential modeling with more comprehensive historical data, and efficient
iterative updates within a unified framework. Furthermore, empirical results on
real-world industrial dataset, alongside public and synthetic datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

characteristics. MoQE alleviates the performance degradation commonly seen in
single quantization models through specialization quantization expert models.
We design lightweight, structure-aware router models tailored for both CV and
NLP tasks. Experimental evaluations on ResNet, LLaMA, and Qwen model families
across benchmark datasets including ImageNet, WikiText, C4, and OpenWebText
demonstrate that MoQE achieves performance comparable to SOTA quantization
model, without incurring significant increases in inference latency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可微分转移模块的修复算法，用于优化微LED制造中的转移步骤，显著减少步骤数和规划时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高通量微LED制造中，选择性激光转移需要计算模型来优化转移序列，减少XY平台运动并适应不同的优化目标。

Method: 提出了一种基于可微分转移模块的修复算法，支持梯度优化，避免了手工特征提取，训练速度更快。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在2000x2000阵列上减少了50%的转移步骤，规划时间低于2分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法为AR/VR和下一代显示制造中的微LED修复提供了实用且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Laser-enabled selective transfer, a key process in high-throughput microLED
fabrication, requires computational models that can plan shift sequences to
minimize motion of XY stages and adapt to varying optimization objectives
across the substrate. We propose the first repair algorithm based on a
differentiable transfer module designed to model discrete shifts of transfer
platforms, while remaining trainable via gradient-based optimization. Compared
to local proximity searching algorithms, our approach achieves superior repair
performance and enables more flexible objective designs, such as minimizing the
number of steps. Unlike reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches, our
method eliminates the need for handcrafted feature extractors and trains
significantly faster, allowing scalability to large arrays. Experiments show a
50% reduction in transfer steps and sub-2-minute planning time on 2000x2000
arrays. This method provides a practical and adaptable solution for
accelerating microLED repair in AR/VR and next-generation display fabrication.

TL;DR: Hi-Vec是一种分层自适应网络，通过动态层选择和权重合并机制，提升预训练模型在测试时对复杂分布变化的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法因单维线性分类层无法应对复杂分布变化的问题。

Method: 提出分层自适应网络Hi-Vec，包括动态层选择、权重合并机制和线性层一致性门控。

Result: 在多个目标数据集上验证了Hi-Vec的优越性，提升了鲁棒性并解决了不确定性问题。

Conclusion: Hi-Vec通过分层动态适应机制，显著提升了测试时适应的性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation allows pretrained models to adjust to incoming data
streams, addressing distribution shifts between source and target domains.
However, standard methods rely on single-dimensional linear classification
layers, which often fail to handle diverse and complex shifts. We propose
Hierarchical Adaptive Networks with Task Vectors (Hi-Vec), which leverages
multiple layers of increasing size for dynamic test-time adaptation. By
decomposing the encoder's representation space into such hierarchically
organized layers, Hi-Vec, in a plug-and-play manner, allows existing methods to
adapt to shifts of varying complexity. Our contributions are threefold: First,
we propose dynamic layer selection for automatic identification of the optimal
layer for adaptation to each test batch. Second, we propose a mechanism that
merges weights from the dynamic layer to other layers, ensuring all layers
receive target information. Third, we propose linear layer agreement that acts
as a gating function, preventing erroneous fine-tuning by adaptation on noisy
batches. We rigorously evaluate the performance of Hi-Vec in challenging
scenarios and on multiple target datasets, proving its strong capability to
advance state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that Hi-Vec improves
robustness, addresses uncertainty, and handles limited batch sizes and
increased outlier rates.

TL;DR: GSMT是一种混合模型，结合图注意力网络和序列到序列RNN，通过任务校正器从大规模轨迹数据中提取复杂行为模式，显著提升公交车轨迹预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据有限的发展中地区，仅依赖GPS数据预测公交车轨迹存在挑战，需开发高效模型。

Method: GSMT整合GAT和RNN，利用任务校正器聚类历史轨迹并优化预测，通过两阶段方法融合动态和静态信息。

Result: 在吉隆坡真实数据集上，GSMT在短期和长期轨迹预测任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GSMT为复杂城市交通环境下的公交车轨迹预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction for buses is crucial in intelligent
transportation systems, particularly within urban environments. In developing
regions where access to multimodal data is limited, relying solely on onboard
GPS data remains indispensable despite inherent challenges. To address this
problem, we propose GSMT, a hybrid model that integrates a Graph Attention
Network (GAT) with a sequence-to-sequence Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and
incorporates a task corrector capable of extracting complex behavioral patterns
from large-scale trajectory data. The task corrector clusters historical
trajectories to identify distinct motion patterns and fine-tunes the
predictions generated by the GAT and RNN. Specifically, GSMT fuses dynamic bus
information and static station information through embedded hybrid networks to
perform trajectory prediction, and applies the task corrector for secondary
refinement after the initial predictions are generated. This two-stage approach
enables multi-node trajectory prediction among buses operating in dense urban
traffic environments under complex conditions. Experiments conducted on a
real-world dataset from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance
in both short-term and long-term trajectory prediction tasks.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of financial technology, the detection of

necessitating robust and innovative solutions. This work proposes a novel
approach by combining Quantum Inspired Graph Neural Networks (QI-GNN) with
flexibility of choice of an Ensemble Model using QBoost or a classic model such

Polyadic (CP) decomposition layer within the graph neural network framework,
enhancing its capability to process and analyze complex data structures
efficiently. Our technical approach has undergone rigorous evaluation against
classical machine learning implementations, achieving an F2 score of 74.8% in
detecting fraudulent transactions. These results highlight the potential of
quantum-inspired techniques, supplemented by the structural advancements of the
CP layer, to not only match but potentially exceed traditional methods in
complex network analysis for financial security. The findings advocate for a
broader adoption and further exploration of quantum-inspired algorithms within
the financial sector to effectively combat fraud.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
in-depth investigation of their potential in tabular data modeling. However,
effectively utilizing advanced LLMs in few-shot and even zero-shot scenarios is
still challenging. To this end, we propose a novel LLM-based prototype
estimation framework for tabular learning. Our key idea is to query the LLM to
generate feature values based example-free prompt, which solely relies on task
and feature descriptions. With the feature values generated by LLM, we can
build a zero-shot prototype in a training-free manner, which can be further
enhanced by fusing few-shot samples, avoiding training a classifier or
finetuning the LLMs. Thanks to the example-free prompt and prototype
estimation, ours bypasses the constraints brought by the example-based prompt,
providing a scalable and robust framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of ours in zero and few-shot tabular learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前气味检测传感器在复杂混合物中表现不佳，且非侵入性记录缺乏单次试验可靠性，因此需要开发一种通用系统。

Method: 使用互补的一维卷积网络（ResCNN和AttentionCNN）解码多通道嗅觉球LFP信号，验证两个假设。

Result: 在7只清醒小鼠的2,349次试验中，模型平均准确率为86.6%，F1分数为81.0%，AUC为0.9247，显著优于之前基准。

Conclusion: 研究证实了从LFP中实现单次试验气味检测的可行性，并展示了深度学习模型在理解嗅觉表征中的潜力。

Abstract: Odor detection underpins food safety, environmental monitoring, medical
diagnostics, and many more fields. The current artificial sensors developed for
odor detection struggle with complex mixtures while non-invasive recordings
lack reliable single-trial fidelity. To develop a general system for odor
detection, in this study we present a preliminary work where we aim to test two
hypotheses: (i) that spectral features of local field potentials (LFPs) are
sufficient for robust single-trial odor detection and (ii) that signals from
the olfactory bulb alone are adequate. To test two hypotheses, we propose an
ensemble of complementary one-dimensional convolutional networks (ResCNN and
AttentionCNN) that decodes the presence of odor from multichannel olfactory
bulb LFPs. Tested on 2,349 trials from seven awake mice, our final ensemble
model supports both hypotheses, achieving a mean accuracy of 86.6%, an F1-score
of 81.0%, and an AUC of 0.9247, substantially outperforming previous
benchmarks. In addition, the t-SNE visualization confirms that our framework
captures biologically significant signatures. These findings establish the
feasibility of robust single-trial detection of the presence of odor from
extracellular LFPs, as well as demonstrate the potential of deep learning
models to provide a deeper understanding of olfactory representations.

*Danial Saber,Amirali Salehi-Abari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种评估图神经网络（GNNs）中信息过度压缩（over-squashing）的拓扑方法，并通过实验验证了重连（rewiring）策略的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs在多个领域表现优异，但存在长距离信息过度压缩的问题，而现有方法缺乏直接的评估指标。

Method: 提出基于节点对间互敏感度衰减率的评估方法，并扩展为四种图级统计量，结合因果设计量化重连策略的影响。

Result: 实验表明，图分类任务中过度压缩普遍存在且重连有效，但节点分类任务中效果不明显甚至有害。

Conclusion: 重连策略在过度压缩严重且适度调整时最有效，工具可帮助实践者预判其效果。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance
across wide-range of domains such as recommender systems, material design, and
drug repurposing. Yet message-passing GNNs suffer from over-squashing --
exponential compression of long-range information from distant nodes -- which
limits expressivity. Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their
practical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical
over-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for
assessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their
mutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four
graph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity).
Coupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how
rewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and
node-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most
graph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various
extents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of
mitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and
method. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node
classification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and
performance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These
findings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both
substantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring,
or rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and
may even harm performance. Our plug-and-play diagnostic tool lets practitioners
decide -- before any training -- whether rewiring is likely to pay off.

Motivation: 现有研究多集中于训练时攻击或不现实场景，缺乏对部署后智能体观测扰动的研究。

Method: 假设攻击者仅能收集并扰动部署智能体的观测，提出简单高效的对抗扰动生成算法。

Result: 在三个基准和22个环境中验证了算法的有效性，且样本效率高（仅需1,000样本）。

Conclusion: 该算法在现实约束下显著提升了对抗攻击的效果，为c-MARL的安全性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) has rapidly
evolved, offering state-of-the-art algorithms for real-world applications,
including sensitive domains. However, a key challenge to its widespread
adoption is the lack of a thorough investigation into its vulnerabilities to
adversarial attacks. Existing work predominantly focuses on training-time
attacks or unrealistic scenarios, such as access to policy weights or the
ability to train surrogate policies. In this paper, we investigate new
vulnerabilities under more realistic and constrained conditions, assuming an
adversary can only collect and perturb the observations of deployed agents. We
also consider scenarios where the adversary has no access at all. We propose
simple yet highly effective algorithms for generating adversarial perturbations
designed to misalign how victim agents perceive their environment. Our approach
is empirically validated on three benchmarks and 22 environments, demonstrating
its effectiveness across diverse algorithms and environments. Furthermore, we
show that our algorithm is sample-efficient, requiring only 1,000 samples
compared to the millions needed by previous methods.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成有意义的学习轨迹，并在深度知识追踪（DKT）中优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为计算机科学教育提供了自动化、可扩展且可解释的知识建模方法。

Abstract: Effective personalized learning in computer science education depends on
accurately modeling what students know and what they need to learn. While
Knowledge Components (KCs) provide a foundation for such modeling, automated KC
extraction from student code is inherently challenging due to insufficient
explainability of discovered KCs and the open-endedness of programming problems
with significant structural variability across student solutions and complex
interactions among programming concepts. In this work, we propose a novel,
explainable framework for automated KC discovery through pattern-based KCs:
recurring structural patterns within student code that capture the specific
programming patterns and language constructs that students must master. Toward
this, we train a Variational Autoencoder to generate important representative
patterns from student code guided by an explainable, attention-based code
representation model that identifies important correct and incorrect pattern
implementations from student code. These patterns are then clustered to form
pattern-based KCs. We evaluate our KCs using two well-established methods
informed by Cognitive Science: learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge
Tracing (DKT). Experimental results demonstrate meaningful learning
trajectories and significant improvements in DKT predictive performance over
traditional KT methods. This work advances knowledge modeling in CS education
by providing an automated, scalable, and explainable framework for identifying
granular code patterns and algorithmic constructs, essential for student
learning.

Result: 成功将复杂强化学习环境压缩为一步监督学习任务，并验证了其在不同学习架构中的通用性。

Conclusion: 数据集蒸馏技术能有效压缩和转换学习任务，为高效学习和跨模态应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses a large dataset into a small synthetic
dataset such that learning on the synthetic dataset approximates learning on
the original. Training on the distilled dataset can be performed in as little
as one step of gradient descent. We demonstrate that distillation is
generalizable to different tasks by distilling reinforcement learning
environments into one-batch supervised learning datasets. This demonstrates not
only distillation's ability to compress a reinforcement learning task but also
its ability to transform one learning modality (reinforcement learning) into
another (supervised learning). We present a novel extension of proximal policy
optimization for meta-learning and use it in distillation of a
multi-dimensional extension of the classic cart-pole problem, all MuJoCo
environments, and several Atari games. We demonstrate distillation's ability to
compress complex RL environments into one-step supervised learning, explore RL
distillation's generalizability across learner architectures, and demonstrate
distilling an environment into the smallest-possible synthetic dataset.

Abstract: Weather forecasting plays a vital role in disaster preparedness, agriculture,
and resource management, yet current centralized forecasting systems are
increasingly strained by security vulnerabilities, limited scalability, and
susceptibility to single points of failure. To address these challenges, we
propose a decentralized weather forecasting framework that integrates Federated
Learning (FL) with blockchain technology. FL enables collaborative model
training without exposing sensitive local data; this approach enhances privacy
and reduces data transfer overhead. Meanwhile, the Ethereum blockchain ensures
transparent and dependable verification of model updates. To further enhance
the system's security, we introduce a reputation-based voting mechanism that
assesses the trustworthiness of submitted models while utilizing the
Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for efficient off-chain storage. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach not only improves forecasting accuracy
but also enhances system resilience and scalability, making it a viable
candidate for deployment in real-world, security-critical environments.

Result: 在标准基准和真实欺诈数据集上验证了GNNev的有效性和优越性能。

Conclusion: GNNev为GNNs提供了更全面的鲁棒性保证，优于现有工具。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to
adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide
adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation
functions in message-passing GNNs is still lacking. In this paper, we develop
an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute
guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge
addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Focusing on node
classification tasks, our method employs constraint solving with bound
tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint
satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of
solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile solver for
message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions,
sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time.
Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on two standard benchmarks (Cora and
CiteSeer) and two real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) demonstrates its
usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance compared to
existing {exact verification} tools on sum-aggregated node classification
tasks.

Motivation: 生物大脑通过突触修剪移除弱连接以提高效率，而人工神经网络中的dropout正则化是随机失活神经元，未考虑活动依赖性修剪。

Method: 提出了一种基于权重大小的修剪方法，通过计算各层权重的绝对大小确定重要性，采用立方进度表逐步增加全局稀疏性，定期永久移除低重要性权重。

Result: 在多个时间序列预测模型（如RNN、LSTM和Patch Time Series Transformer）上实验，结果显示该方法在多个数据集上表现最佳，显著降低了平均绝对误差（金融预测中最高降低20%）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态修剪机制将权重消除与渐进稀疏化结合，易于集成到多种架构中，尤其在金融时间序列预测中表现突出，是传统dropout技术的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Synaptic pruning in biological brains removes weak connections to improve
efficiency. In contrast, dropout regularization in artificial neural networks
randomly deactivates neurons without considering activity-dependent pruning. We
propose a magnitude-based synaptic pruning method that better reflects biology
by progressively removing low-importance connections during training.
Integrated directly into the training loop as a dropout replacement, our
approach computes weight importance from absolute magnitudes across layers and
applies a cubic schedule to gradually increase global sparsity. At fixed
intervals, pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while
maintaining gradient flow for active ones, eliminating the need for separate
pruning and fine-tuning phases. Experiments on multiple time series forecasting
models including RNN, LSTM, and Patch Time Series Transformer across four
datasets show consistent gains. Our method ranked best overall, with
statistically significant improvements confirmed by Friedman tests (p < 0.01).
In financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over
models with no or standard dropout, and up to 52% in select transformer models.
This dynamic pruning mechanism advances regularization by coupling weight
elimination with progressive sparsification, offering easy integration into
diverse architectures. Its strong performance, especially in financial time
series forecasting, highlights its potential as a practical alternative to
conventional dropout techniques.

Abstract: We propose RicciFlowRec, a geometric recommendation framework that performs
root cause attribution via Ricci curvature and flow on dynamic financial
graphs. By modelling evolving interactions among stocks, macroeconomic
indicators, and news, we quantify local stress using discrete Ricci curvature
and trace shock propagation via Ricci flow. Curvature gradients reveal causal
substructures, informing a structural risk-aware ranking function. Preliminary
results on S\&P~500 data with FinBERT-based sentiment show improved robustness
and interpretability under synthetic perturbations. This ongoing work supports
curvature-based attribution and early-stage risk-aware ranking, with plans for
portfolio optimization and return forecasting. To our knowledge, RicciFlowRec
is the first recommender to apply geometric flow-based reasoning in financial
decision support.

TL;DR: 领域限制的稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在医学文本上训练，提高了重建保真度和可解释性，减少了线性残差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SAEs在广泛数据分布上训练，导致高频率通用模式捕获不足，残差大且特征解释性差。

Method: 在医学文本上训练JumpReLU SAEs，使用195k临床问答数据，分析Gemma-2模型的第20层激活。

Result: 领域限制的SAEs解释了更多方差，提高了损失恢复，减少了线性残差，特征与临床概念对齐。

Conclusion: 领域限制缓解了广泛SAEs的局限性，支持更完整和可解释的潜在分解，质疑通用SAEs的扩展需求。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose large language model (LLM) activations
into latent features that reveal mechanistic structure. Conventional SAEs train
on broad data distributions, forcing a fixed latent budget to capture only
high-frequency, generic patterns. This often results in significant linear
``dark matter'' in reconstruction error and produces latents that fragment or
absorb each other, complicating interpretation. We show that restricting SAE
training to a well-defined domain (medical text) reallocates capacity to
domain-specific features, improving both reconstruction fidelity and
interpretability. Training JumpReLU SAEs on layer-20 activations of Gemma-2
models using 195k clinical QA examples, we find that domain-confined SAEs
explain up to 20\% more variance, achieve higher loss recovery, and reduce
linear residual error compared to broad-domain SAEs. Automated and human
evaluations confirm that learned features align with clinically meaningful
concepts (e.g., ``taste sensations'' or ``infectious mononucleosis''), rather
than frequent but uninformative tokens. These domain-specific SAEs capture
relevant linear structure, leaving a smaller, more purely nonlinear residual.
We conclude that domain-confinement mitigates key limitations of broad-domain
SAEs, enabling more complete and interpretable latent decompositions, and
suggesting the field may need to question ``foundation-model'' scaling for
general-purpose SAEs.

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型在病理语音与图像对齐方面具有潜力，且可用于痴呆症检测。

Abstract: Text-to-image models generate highly realistic images based on natural
language descriptions and millions of users use them to create and share images
online. While it is expected that such models can align input text and
generated image in the same latent space little has been done to understand
whether this alignment is possible between pathological speech and generated
images. In this work, we examine the ability of such models to align
dementia-related speech information with the generated images and develop
methods to explain this alignment. Surprisingly, we found that dementia
detection is possible from generated images alone achieving 75% accuracy on the
ADReSS dataset. We then leverage explainability methods to show which parts of
the language contribute to the detection.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of data privacy and collaborative
modeling in cross-institution financial risk analysis. It proposes a risk
assessment framework based on federated learning. Without sharing raw data, the
method enables joint modeling and risk identification across multiple
institutions. This is achieved by incorporating a feature attention mechanism
and temporal modeling structure. Specifically, the model adopts a distributed
optimization strategy. Each financial institution trains a local sub-model. The
model parameters are protected using differential privacy and noise injection
before being uploaded. A central server then aggregates these parameters to
generate a global model. This global model is used for systemic risk
identification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, multiple
experiments are conducted. These evaluate communication efficiency, model
accuracy, systemic risk detection, and cross-market generalization. The results
show that the proposed model outperforms both traditional centralized methods
and existing federated learning variants across all evaluation metrics. It
demonstrates strong modeling capabilities and practical value in sensitive
financial environments. The method enhances the scope and efficiency of risk
identification while preserving data sovereignty. It offers a secure and
efficient solution for intelligent financial risk analysis.

Result: 在真实数据上表现优于现有模型，捕捉异常传播路径和动态行为序列的能力更强。

Conclusion: 方法具有表达力和稳定性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection method for distributed
backend service systems, addressing practical challenges such as complex
structural dependencies, diverse behavioral evolution, and the absence of
labeled data. The method constructs a dynamic graph based on service invocation
relationships and applies graph convolution to extract high-order structural
representations from multi-hop topologies. A Transformer is used to model the
temporal behavior of each node, capturing long-term dependencies and local
fluctuations. During the feature fusion stage, a learnable joint embedding
mechanism integrates structural and behavioral representations into a unified
anomaly vector. A nonlinear mapping is then applied to compute anomaly scores,
enabling an end-to-end detection process without supervision. Experiments on
real-world cloud monitoring data include sensitivity analyses across different
graph depths, sequence lengths, and data perturbations. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing models on several key metrics,
demonstrating stronger expressiveness and stability in capturing anomaly
propagation paths and modeling dynamic behavior sequences, with high potential
for practical deployment.

Motivation: 现实中的许多交互是基于群体的（如多作者论文、用户共同参与项目），传统超图神经网络因固定层数的显式消息传递限制了长距离依赖捕捉且训练不稳定。

Method: 引入隐式平衡公式，通过非线性固定点方程计算表示，开发了收敛性可证明的训练方案，分析了模型的过平滑条件和表达能力，并推导了超图上的转导泛化界。

Conclusion: IHGNN为高阶关系学习提供了稳定、高效且泛化能力强的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Many real-world interactions are group-based rather than pairwise such as
papers with multiple co-authors and users jointly engaging with items.
Hypergraph neural networks have shown great promise at modeling higher-order
relations, but their reliance on a fixed number of explicit message-passing
layers limits long-range dependency capture and can destabilize training as
depth grows. In this work, we introduce Implicit Hypergraph Neural Networks
(IHGNN), which bring the implicit equilibrium formulation to hypergraphs:
instead of stacking layers, IHGNN computes representations as the solution to a
nonlinear fixed-point equation, enabling stable and efficient global
propagation across hyperedges without deep architectures. We develop a
well-posed training scheme with provable convergence, analyze the oversmoothing
conditions and expressivity of the model, and derive a transductive
generalization bound on hypergraphs. We further present an implicit-gradient
training procedure coupled with a projection-based stabilization strategy.
Extensive experiments on citation benchmarks show that IHGNN consistently
outperforms strong traditional graph/hypergraph neural network baselines in
both accuracy and robustness. Empirically, IHGNN is resilient to random
initialization and hyperparameter variation, highlighting its strong
generalization and practical value for higher-order relational learning.

Result: 在洛杉矶地区195个传感器数据上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NEXICA在准确性和计算速度上优于现有技术。

Abstract: Road traffic congestion is a persistent problem. Focusing resources on the
causes of congestion is a potentially efficient strategy for reducing
slowdowns. We present NEXICA, an algorithm to discover which parts of the
highway system tend to cause slowdowns on other parts of the highway. We use
time series of road speeds as inputs to our causal discovery algorithm. Finding
other algorithms inadequate, we develop a new approach that is novel in three
ways. First, it concentrates on just the presence or absence of events in the
time series, where an event indicates the temporal beginning of a traffic
slowdown. Second, we develop a probabilistic model using maximum likelihood
estimation to compute the probabilities of spontaneous and caused slowdowns
between two locations on the highway. Third, we train a binary classifier to
identify pairs of cause/effect locations trained on pairs of road locations
where we are reasonably certain a priori of their causal connections, both
positive and negative. We test our approach on six months of road speed data
from 195 different highway speed sensors in the Los Angeles area, showing that
our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
computation speed.

Motivation: 探索对比学习和生成方法在多变量时间序列中的互补潜力，解决各自局限性。

Method: 提出Contrastive Generative Time series框架（CoGenT），联合优化对比和生成目标。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优异，F1分数分别比SimCLR和MAE提升59.2%和14.27%。

Conclusion: CoGenT为时间序列领域的混合自监督学习奠定了基础，兼具判别性和生成鲁棒性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for multivariate time series mainly includes
two paradigms: contrastive methods that excel at instance discrimination and
generative approaches that model data distributions. While effective
individually, their complementary potential remains unexplored. We propose a
Contrastive Generative Time series framework (CoGenT), the first framework to
unify these paradigms through joint contrastive-generative optimization. CoGenT
addresses fundamental limitations of both approaches: it overcomes contrastive
learning's sensitivity to high intra-class similarity in temporal data while
reducing generative methods' dependence on large datasets. We evaluate CoGenT
on six diverse time series datasets. The results show consistent improvements,
with up to 59.2% and 14.27% F1 gains over standalone SimCLR and MAE,
respectively. Our analysis reveals that the hybrid objective preserves
discriminative power while acquiring generative robustness. These findings
establish a foundation for hybrid SSL in temporal domains. We will release the
code shortly.

Motivation: 在多重模式过程中，同一健康状态的样本常呈现多簇分布，难以构建紧凑准确的决策边界，因此需要一种能有效识别未知故障的诊断系统。

Method: 结合多尺度深度卷积、双向门控循环单元和时间注意力机制捕捉判别特征，设计基于距离的损失函数增强类内紧凑性，通过无监督学习构建细粒度特征表示，利用极值理论建模样本特征与细粒度表示的距离。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在识别未知故障方面表现出色。

Conclusion: FGCRN模型能有效解决多模式过程中的故障诊断问题，尤其在识别未知故障方面具有优越性能。

Abstract: A reliable fault diagnosis system should not only accurately classify known
health states but also effectively identify unknown faults. In multimode
processes, samples belonging to the same health state often show multiple
cluster distributions, making it difficult to construct compact and accurate
decision boundaries for that state. To address this challenge, a novel open-set
fault diagnosis model named fine-grained clustering and rejection network
(FGCRN) is proposed. It combines multiscale depthwise convolution,
bidirectional gated recurrent unit and temporal attention mechanism to capture
discriminative features. A distance-based loss function is designed to enhance
the intra-class compactness. Fine-grained feature representations are
constructed through unsupervised learning to uncover the intrinsic structures
of each health state. Extreme value theory is employed to model the distance
between sample features and their corresponding fine-grained representations,
enabling effective identification of unknown faults. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

Conclusion: GraB-NAS通过混合搜索策略，显著提升了Meta-NAS的性能和适用性。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates the design of high-performing
neural networks but typically targets a single predefined task, thereby
restricting its real-world applicability. To address this, Meta Neural
Architecture Search (Meta-NAS) has emerged as a promising paradigm that
leverages prior knowledge across tasks to enable rapid adaptation to new ones.
Nevertheless, existing Meta-NAS methods often struggle with poor
generalization, limited search spaces, or high computational costs. In this
paper, we propose a novel Meta-NAS framework, GraB-NAS. Specifically, GraB-NAS
first models neural architectures as graphs, and then a hybrid search strategy
is developed to find and generate new graphs that lead to promising neural
architectures. The search strategy combines global architecture search via
Bayesian Optimization in the search space with local exploration for novel
neural networks via gradient ascent in the latent space. Such a hybrid search
strategy allows GraB-NAS to discover task-aware architectures with strong
performance, even beyond the predefined search space. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GraB-NAS outperforms state-of-the-art Meta-NAS baselines,
achieving better generalization and search effectiveness.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are ubiquitous technologies deployed across
smart cities, industrial sites, and healthcare systems. They continuously
generate time series data that enable advanced analytics and automation in
industries. However, challenges such as the loss or ambiguity of sensor
metadata, heterogeneity in data sources, varying sampling frequencies,
inconsistent units of measurement, and irregular timestamps make raw IoT time
series data difficult to interpret, undermining the effectiveness of smart
systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model,
DeepFeatIoT, which integrates learned local and global features with
non-learned randomized convolutional kernel-based features and features from
large language models (LLMs). This straightforward yet unique fusion of diverse
learned and non-learned features significantly enhances IoT time series sensor
data classification, even in scenarios with limited labeled data. Our model's
effectiveness is demonstrated through its consistent and generalized
performance across multiple real-world IoT sensor datasets from diverse
critical application domains, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark models.
These results highlight DeepFeatIoT's potential to drive significant
advancements in IoT analytics and support the development of next-generation
smart systems.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more widely adopted and scale up in

massive foundation models have grown increasingly severe. This underscores the
urgent need to develop more efficient model variants. Faced with this
challenge, the present work introduces EGGS-PTP: an Expander-Graph Guided
Structured Post-training Pruning method. The proposed approach leverages graph

Result: 实验表明，NeuronTune在安全性和性能上均显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: NeuronTune为LLMs的安全与性能优化提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring robust safety alignment while preserving utility is critical for the
reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
techniques fundamentally suffer from intertwined deficiencies: insufficient
robustness against malicious attacks, frequent refusal of benign queries,
degradation in generated text quality and general task performance--the former
two reflecting deficits in robust safety and the latter constituting utility
impairment. We trace these limitations to the coarse-grained layer-wise
interventions in existing methods. To resolve this, we propose NeuronTune, a
fine-grained framework that dynamically modulates sparse neurons to achieve
simultaneous safety-utility optimization. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical and utility-preserving neurons across all layers via
attribution, then employs meta-learning to adaptively amplify safety-neuron
activations and suppress utility-neuron activations. Crucially, NeuronTune
enables tunable adjustment of intervention scope via neuron-count thresholds,
supporting flexible adaptation to security-critical or utility-priority
scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art technologies, achieving
superior model safety while maintaining excellent utility.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了基础模型在联邦持续学习中的挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for Foundation Models (FMs) is an essential yet
underexplored challenge, especially in Federated Continual Learning (FCL),
where each client learns from a private, evolving task stream under strict data
and communication constraints. Despite their powerful generalization abilities,
FMs often exhibit suboptimal performance on local downstream tasks, as they are
unable to utilize private local data. Furthermore, enabling FMs to learn new
tasks without forgetting prior knowledge is inherently a challenging problem,
primarily due to their immense parameter count and high model complexity. In
contrast, small models can be trained locally under resource-constrained
conditions and benefit from more mature CL techniques. To bridge the gap
between small models and FMs, we propose the first collaborative framework in
FCL, where lightweight local models act as a dynamic bridge, continually
adapting to new tasks while enhancing the utility of the large model. Two novel
components are also included: Small Model Continual Fine-tuning is for
preventing small models from temporal forgetting; One-by-One Distillation
performs personalized fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server.
Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance, even when clients
utilize heterogeneous small models.

Abstract: Quantized Neural Networks (QNN) with extremely low-bitwidth data have proven
promising in efficient storage and computation on edge devices. To further
reduce the accuracy drop while increasing speedup, layer-wise mixed-precision
quantization (MPQ) becomes a popular solution. However, existing algorithms for
exploring MPQ schemes are limited in flexibility and efficiency. Comprehending
the complex impacts of different MPQ schemes on post-training quantization and
quantization-aware training results is a challenge for conventional methods.
Furthermore, an end-to-end framework for the optimization and deployment of MPQ
models is missing in existing work.
  In this paper, we propose the MiCo framework, a holistic MPQ exploration and
deployment framework for edge AI applications. The framework adopts a novel
optimization algorithm to search for optimal quantization schemes with the
highest accuracies while meeting latency constraints. Hardware-aware latency
models are built for different hardware targets to enable fast explorations.
After the exploration, the framework enables direct deployment from PyTorch MPQ
models to bare-metal C codes, leading to end-to-end speedup with minimal
accuracy drops.

Conclusion: CGAD通过因果分析重新定义了异常检测的鲁棒性，尤其在非平稳和不平衡数据中表现优异。

Abstract: With the growing complexity of cyberattacks targeting critical
infrastructures such as water treatment networks, there is a pressing need for
robust anomaly detection strategies that account for both system
vulnerabilities and evolving attack patterns. Traditional methods --
statistical, density-based, and graph-based models struggle with distribution
shifts and class imbalance in multivariate time series, often leading to high
false positive rates. To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal
Graph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack
detection in public infrastructure systems. CGAD follows a two-phase supervised
framework -- causal profiling and anomaly scoring. First, it learns causal
invariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under "Normal"
and "Attack" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs
structural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by
evaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging
causal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in
non-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional
machine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile
sensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher
precision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving
resilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift. Our
framework achieves substantial gains in F1 and ROC-AUC scores over
best-performing baselines across four industrial datasets, demonstrating robust
detection of delayed and structurally complex anomalies.

Conclusion: Gauss-Tin展示了混合模型在动态学习环境中增强LLMs鲁棒性和适应性的潜力。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs),
catastrophic forgetting remains a substantial challenge, where models lose
previously acquired knowledge upon learning new information. Continual learning
(CL) strategies have emerged as a potential solution to this problem, with
replay-based techniques demonstrating superior performance in preserving
learned knowledge. In this context, we introduce Gauss-Tin, a novel approach
that integrates the replay strategy with a Gaussian mixture model to enhance
the quality of sample selection during training, supplemented by instructional
guidance to facilitate the generation of past learning. This method aims to
improve LLMs' retention capabilities by strategically reinforcing important
past learnings while accommodating new information. Our experimental results
indicate a promising 6\% improvement in retention metrics over traditional
methods, suggesting that Gauss-Tin is an effective strategy for mitigating
catastrophic forgetting in LLMs. This study underscores the potential of hybrid
models in enhancing the robustness and adaptability of LLMs in dynamic learning
environments.

Abstract: Predictive Business Process Monitoring (PBPM) aims to forecast future events

(GNNs) are well suited to capture structural dependencies in process data,
existing GNN-based PBPM models remain underdeveloped. Most rely either on short

transition semantics. We propose a unified, interpretable GNN framework that
advances the state of the art along three key axes. First, we compare
prefix-based Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) and full trace Graph Attention
Networks(GATs) to quantify the performance gap between localized and global
modeling. Second, we introduce a novel time decay attention mechanism that
constructs dynamic, prediction-centered windows, emphasizing temporally
relevant history and suppressing noise. Third, we embed transition type
semantics into edge features to enable fine grained reasoning over structurally
ambiguous traces. Our architecture includes multilevel interpretability
modules, offering diverse visualizations of attention behavior. Evaluated on
five benchmarks, the proposed models achieve competitive Top-k accuracy and DL
scores without per-dataset tuning. By addressing architectural, temporal, and
semantic gaps, this work presents a robust, generalizable, and explainable
solution for next event prediction in PBPM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车联网系统中，客户端的移动性、资源异构性和间歇性连接使得多任务适应具有挑战性。

Method: 采用分层联邦微调框架，结合LoRA和UCB-DUAL算法，解决能效和延迟问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在延迟减少24%以上，平均准确率提高2.5%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架在动态车联网场景中实现了高效的资源感知和移动弹性学习。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach for adapting
foundation models (FMs) to diverse downstream tasks in edge environments. In
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, enabling efficient and low-latency
multi-task adaptation is particularly challenging due to client mobility,
heterogeneous resources, and intermittent connectivity. This paper proposes a
hierarchical federated fine-tuning framework that coordinates roadside units
(RSUs) and vehicles to support resource-aware and mobility-resilient learning
across dynamic IoV scenarios. Leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we
introduce a decentralized, energy-aware rank adaptation mechanism formulated as
a constrained multi-armed bandit problem. A novel UCB-DUAL algorithm is
developed to enable adaptive exploration under per-task energy budgets,
achieving provable sublinear regret. To evaluate our method, we construct a
large-scale IoV simulator based on real-world trajectories, capturing dynamic
participation, RSU handoffs, and communication variability. Extensive
experiments show that our approach achieves the best accuracy-efficiency
trade-off among all baselines, reducing latency by over 24\% and improving
average accuracy by more than 2.5\%.

Result: 在SST2和MHS数据集上，SYNAPSE-G在发现正标签方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SYNAPSE-G通过合成数据和标签传播有效解决了稀有事件分类问题。

Abstract: Scarcity of labeled data, especially for rare events, hinders training
effective machine learning models. This paper proposes SYNAPSE-G (Synthetic
Augmentation for Positive Sampling via Expansion on Graphs), a novel pipeline
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data for
rare event classification, addressing the cold-start problem. This synthetic
data serve as seeds for semi-supervised label propagation on a similarity graph
constructed between the seeds and a large unlabeled dataset. This identifies
candidate positive examples, subsequently labeled by an oracle (human or LLM).
The expanded dataset then trains/fine-tunes a classifier. We theoretically
analyze how the quality (validity and diversity) of the synthetic data impacts
the precision and recall of our method. Experiments on the imbalanced SST2 and
MHS datasets demonstrate SYNAPSE-G's effectiveness in finding positive labels,
outperforming baselines including nearest neighbor search.

TL;DR: EGI（边缘通用智能）通过世界模型实现自主感知、推理和行动，为边缘计算带来变革。本文综述了世界模型在EGI中的应用、架构及挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索世界模型在无线边缘计算中的潜力，填补其在EGI中应用的空白。

Method: 分析世界模型的架构（如潜在表示学习、动态建模和基于想象的规划），并展示其在EGI场景中的应用。

Result: 世界模型可优化延迟、能耗和隐私，并与基础模型和数字孪生协同，成为EGI的认知核心。

Conclusion: 世界模型为EGI提供了理论和实践基础，但仍需解决安全性、训练效率和部署限制等挑战。

Abstract: Edge General Intelligence (EGI) represents a transformative evolution of edge
computing, where distributed agents possess the capability to perceive, reason,
and act autonomously across diverse, dynamic environments. Central to this
vision are world models, which act as proactive internal simulators that not
only predict but also actively imagine future trajectories, reason under
uncertainty, and plan multi-step actions with foresight. This proactive nature
allows agents to anticipate potential outcomes and optimize decisions ahead of
real-world interactions. While prior works in robotics and gaming have
showcased the potential of world models, their integration into the wireless
edge for EGI remains underexplored. This survey bridges this gap by offering a
comprehensive analysis of how world models can empower agentic artificial
intelligence (AI) systems at the edge. We first examine the architectural
foundations of world models, including latent representation learning, dynamics
modeling, and imagination-based planning. Building on these core capabilities,
we illustrate their proactive applications across EGI scenarios such as
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, the Internet of
Things (IoT) systems, and network functions virtualization, thereby
highlighting how they can enhance optimization under latency, energy, and
privacy constraints. We then explore their synergy with foundation models and
digital twins, positioning world models as the cognitive backbone of EGI.
Finally, we highlight open challenges, such as safety guarantees, efficient
training, and constrained deployment, and outline future research directions.
This survey provides both a conceptual foundation and a practical roadmap for
realizing the next generation of intelligent, autonomous edge systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性预测模型允许预测者在任意时间开始预测，但现实中预测窗口可能受限，因此需要研究有限选择性下的预测性能。

Method: 提出PLS模型，分析实例依赖和平均情况下的最优预测误差，并引入复杂度度量方法。

Result: 复杂度度量方法能提供实例依赖的最优误差界限，且在随机生成的PLS实例中高概率匹配。

Conclusion: 有限选择性预测模型（PLS）为预测窗口受限的场景提供了理论支持，复杂度度量方法有效。

Abstract: Selective prediction [Dru13, QV19] models the scenario where a forecaster
freely decides on the prediction window that their forecast spans. Many data
statistics can be predicted to a non-trivial error rate without any
distributional assumptions or expert advice, yet these results rely on that the
forecaster may predict at any time. We introduce a model of Prediction with
Limited Selectivity (PLS) where the forecaster can start the prediction only on
a subset of the time horizon. We study the optimal prediction error both on an
instance-by-instance basis and via an average-case analysis. We introduce a
complexity measure that gives instance-dependent bounds on the optimal error.
For a randomly-generated PLS instance, these bounds match with high
probability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究显示，动作与状态转换之间的因果关系能提升智能体的探索效率，但在复杂场景中测量因果性具有挑战性。

Result: 实验表明，高因果能力的状态与预期子目标一致，GDCC在多目标任务中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GDCC通过因果能力和子目标引导，有效提升了强化学习中的探索效率。

Abstract: Causal inference is crucial for humans to explore the world, which can be
modeled to enable an agent to efficiently explore the environment in
reinforcement learning. Existing research indicates that establishing the
causality between action and state transition will enhance an agent to reason
how a policy affects its future trajectory, thereby promoting directed
exploration. However, it is challenging to measure the causality due to its
intractability in the vast state-action space of complex scenarios. In this
paper, we propose a novel Goal Discovery with Causal Capacity (GDCC) framework
for efficient environment exploration. Specifically, we first derive a
measurement of causality in state space, \emph{i.e.,} causal capacity, which
represents the highest influence of an agent's behavior on future trajectories.
After that, we present a Monte Carlo based method to identify critical points
in discrete state space and further optimize this method for continuous
high-dimensional environments. Those critical points are used to uncover where
the agent makes important decisions in the environment, which are then regarded
as our subgoals to guide the agent to make exploration more purposefully and
efficiently. Empirical results from multi-objective tasks demonstrate that
states with high causal capacity align with our expected subgoals, and our GDCC
achieves significant success rate improvements compared to baselines.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently and accurately
remains a cornerstone challenge in science and engineering, especially for
problems involving complex geometries and limited labeled data. We introduce a
Physics- and Geometry- Aware Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator
($\pi$G-Sp$^2$GNO) for learning the solution operators of time-independent and
time-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach first improves upon the recently
developed Sp$^2$GNO by enabling geometry awareness and subsequently exploits
the governing physics to learn the underlying solution operator in a
simulation-free setup. While the spatio-spectral structure present in the
proposed architecture allows multiscale learning, two separate strategies for
enabling geometry awareness is introduced in this paper. For time dependent
problems, we also introduce a novel hybrid physics informed loss function that
combines higher-order time-marching scheme with upscaled theory inspired
stochastic projection scheme. This allows accurate integration of the
physics-information into the loss function. The performance of the proposed
approach is illustrated on number of benchmark examples involving regular and
complex domains, variation in geometry during inference, and time-independent
and time-dependent problems. The results obtained illustrate the efficacy of
the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art physics-informed
neural operator algorithms in the literature.

Motivation: 传统时间序列模型忽略变量语义信息，而TimeMKG旨在利用变量名称和描述中的领域知识，实现更鲁棒和可解释的建模。

Method: TimeMKG使用大语言模型解析变量语义，构建多变量知识图谱，并通过双模态编码器和跨模态注意力融合语义与统计模式。

Result: 实验表明，引入变量级知识显著提升了预测性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: TimeMKG通过结合语义和统计信息，为时间序列建模提供了更高效和可解释的方法。

Abstract: Multivariate time series data typically comprises two distinct modalities:
variable semantics and sampled numerical observations. Traditional time series
models treat variables as anonymous statistical signals, overlooking the rich
semantic information embedded in variable names and data descriptions. However,
these textual descriptors often encode critical domain knowledge that is
essential for robust and interpretable modeling. Here we present TimeMKG, a
multimodal causal reasoning framework that elevates time series modeling from
low-level signal processing to knowledge informed inference. TimeMKG employs
large language models to interpret variable semantics and constructs structured
Multivariate Knowledge Graphs that capture inter-variable relationships. A
dual-modality encoder separately models the semantic prompts, generated from
knowledge graph triplets, and the statistical patterns from historical time
series. Cross-modality attention aligns and fuses these representations at the
variable level, injecting causal priors into downstream tasks such as
forecasting and classification, providing explicit and interpretable priors to
guide model reasoning. The experiment in diverse datasets demonstrates that
incorporating variable-level knowledge significantly improves both predictive
performance and generalization.

TL;DR: Thermal Tracks是一个基于Python的统计框架，用于分析蛋白质热稳定性数据，克服了现有热蛋白质组分析（TPP）方法的关键限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TPP方法假设熔解曲线为S形，并受限于经验零分布，导致仅能检测约5%的数据中的显著变化。Thermal Tracks旨在解决这一问题，为更广泛的蛋白质热稳定性分析提供灵活且无偏的方法。

Method: 使用高斯过程（GP）模型和平方指数核，灵活建模任何熔解曲线形状，并通过核先验生成无偏零分布。

Result: Thermal Tracks能够分析蛋白质组范围内的扰动（如通路抑制、基因修饰或环境压力），并特别适用于具有非传统熔解曲线的蛋白质（如相分离蛋白和膜蛋白）。

Conclusion: Thermal Tracks是一个免费、灵活且易于使用的工具，适用于广泛的蛋白质热稳定性研究。

Abstract: Thermal Tracks is a Python-based statistical framework for analyzing protein
thermal stability data that overcomes key limitations of existing thermal
proteome profiling (TPP) work-flows. Unlike standard approaches that assume
sigmoidal melting curves and are constrained by empirical null distributions
(limiting significant hits to approximately 5 % of data), Thermal Tracks uses
Gaussian Process (GP) models with squared-exponential kernels to flexibly model
any melting curve shape while generating unbiased null distributions through
kernel priors. This framework is particularly valuable for analyzing
proteome-wide perturbations that significantly alter protein thermal stability,
such as pathway inhibitions, genetic modifications, or environmental stresses,
where conventional TPP methods may miss biologically relevant changes due to
their statistical constraints. Furthermore, Thermal Tracks excels at analyzing
proteins with un-conventional melting profiles, including phase-separating
proteins and membrane proteins, which often exhibit complex, non-sigmoidal
thermal stability behaviors. Thermal Tracks is freely available from GitHub and
is implemented in Python, providing an accessible and flexible tool for
proteome-wide thermal profiling studies.

Result: 理论和实验表明，无需正则化项的梯度下降方法具有线性收敛率，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 梯度下降方法在非对称低秩矩阵补全中表现出隐式正则化特性，无需显式正则化即可高效收敛。

Abstract: This paper investigates the asymmetric low-rank matrix completion problem,
which can be formulated as an unconstrained non-convex optimization problem
with a nonlinear least-squares objective function, and is solved via gradient
descent methods. Previous gradient descent approaches typically incorporate
regularization terms into the objective function to guarantee convergence.
However, numerical experiments and theoretical analysis of the gradient flow
both demonstrate that the elimination of regularization terms in gradient
descent algorithms does not adversely affect convergence performance. By
introducing the leave-one-out technique, we inductively prove that the vanilla
gradient descent with spectral initialization achieves a linear convergence
rate with high probability. Besides, we demonstrate that the balancing
regularization term exhibits a small norm during iterations, which reveals the
implicit regularization property of gradient descent. Empirical results show
that our algorithm has a lower computational cost while maintaining comparable
completion performance compared to other gradient descent algorithms.

Result: 实验表明DCM在合成和真实噪声数据集上优于现有方法，并首次验证KANs在噪声标签下的优越性。

Conclusion: DCM可与其他噪声鲁棒方法结合，提升模型性能，KANs在噪声场景中表现优于MLPs。

Abstract: Noisy labels are inevitable in real-world scenarios. Due to the strong
capacity of deep neural networks to memorize corrupted labels, these noisy
labels can cause significant performance degradation. Existing research on
mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels has mainly focused on robust
loss functions and sample selection, with comparatively limited exploration of
regularization in model architecture. Inspired by the sparsity regularization
used in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose a Dynamic Connection
Masking (DCM) mechanism for both Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks (MLPs) and
KANs to enhance the robustness of classifiers against noisy labels. The
mechanism can adaptively mask less important edges during training by
evaluating their information-carrying capacity. Through theoretical analysis,
we demonstrate its efficiency in reducing gradient error. Our approach can be
seamlessly integrated into various noise-robust training methods to build more
robust deep networks, including robust loss functions, sample selection
strategies, and regularization techniques. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we are also the
first to investigate KANs as classifiers against noisy labels, revealing their
superior noise robustness over MLPs in real-world noisy scenarios. Our code
will soon be publicly available.

Abstract: Brain connectomes, representing neural connectivity as graphs, are crucial
for understanding brain organization but costly and time-consuming to acquire,
motivating generative approaches. Recent advances in graph generative modeling
offer a data-driven alternative, enabling synthetic connectome generation and
reducing dependence on large neuroimaging datasets. However, current models
face key limitations: (i) compressing the whole graph into a single latent code
(e.g., VGAEs) blurs fine-grained local motifs; (ii) relying on rich node
attributes rarely available in connectomes reduces reconstruction quality;
(iii) edge-centric models emphasize topology but overlook accurate edge-weight
prediction, harming quantitative fidelity; and (iv) computationally expensive
designs (e.g., edge-conditioned convolutions) impose high memory demands,
limiting scalability. We propose GraphTreeGen (GTG), a subtree-centric
generative framework for efficient, accurate connectome synthesis. GTG
decomposes each connectome into entropy-guided k-hop trees capturing
informative local structure, encoded by a shared GCN. A bipartite
message-passing layer fuses subtree embeddings with global node features, while
a dual-branch decoder jointly predicts edge existence and weights to
reconstruct the adjacency matrix. GTG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
self-supervised tasks and remains competitive in supervised settings,
delivering higher structural fidelity and more precise weights with far less
memory. Its modular design enables extensions to connectome super-resolution
and cross-modality synthesis. Code: https://github.com/basiralab/GTG/

Result: 在ARDS识别任务中，性能提升10%，同时学习到更全面的概念，减少信息泄露和虚假依赖。

Conclusion: 结合LLM的CBM方法在临床数据标注任务中表现更优，提高了模型的解释性和准确性。

Abstract: Large, publicly available clinical datasets have emerged as a novel resource
for understanding disease heterogeneity and to explore personalization of
therapy. These datasets are derived from data not originally collected for
research purposes and, as a result, are often incomplete and lack critical
labels. Many AI tools have been developed to retrospectively label these
datasets, such as by performing disease classification; however, they often
suffer from limited interpretability. Previous work has attempted to explain
predictions using Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which learn interpretable
concepts that map to higher-level clinical ideas, facilitating human
evaluation. However, these models often experience performance limitations when
the concepts fail to adequately explain or characterize the task. We use the
identification of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as a challenging
test case to demonstrate the value of incorporating contextual information from
clinical notes to improve CBM performance. Our approach leverages a Large
Language Model (LLM) to process clinical notes and generate additional
concepts, resulting in a 10% performance gain over existing methods.
Additionally, it facilitates the learning of more comprehensive concepts,
thereby reducing the risk of information leakage and reliance on spurious
shortcuts, thus improving the characterization of ARDS.

Result: 在电商平台部署后，广告收入显著提升。

Conclusion: GenCO框架有效解决创意组合选择问题，并发布工业数据集推动研究。

Abstract: In e-commerce advertising, selecting the most compelling combination of
creative elements -- such as titles, images, and highlights -- is critical for
capturing user attention and driving conversions. However, existing methods
often evaluate creative components individually, failing to navigate the
exponentially large search space of possible combinations. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel framework named GenCO that integrates generative
modeling with multi-instance reward learning. Our unified two-stage
architecture first employs a generative model to efficiently produce a diverse
set of creative combinations. This generative process is optimized with
reinforcement learning, enabling the model to effectively explore and refine
its selections. Next, to overcome the challenge of sparse user feedback, a
multi-instance learning model attributes combination-level rewards, such as
clicks, to the individual creative elements. This allows the reward model to
provide a more accurate feedback signal, which in turn guides the generative
model toward creating more effective combinations. Deployed on a leading
e-commerce platform, our approach has significantly increased advertising
revenue, demonstrating its practical value. Additionally, we are releasing a
large-scale industrial dataset to facilitate further research in this important
domain.

Motivation: 当前神经网络研究倾向于增加模型深度和容量，但牺牲了可集成性和效率。HKT旨在通过结构化知识继承提升小型模型的性能。

Conclusion: HKT为资源受限环境提供了一种通用、可解释且可扩展的高性能神经网络部署方案。

Abstract: A prevailing trend in neural network research suggests that model performance
improves with increasing depth and capacity - often at the cost of
integrability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a strategy to optimize
small, deployable models by enhancing their capabilities through structured
knowledge inheritance. We introduce Hereditary Knowledge Transfer (HKT), a
biologically inspired framework for modular and selective transfer of
task-relevant features from a larger, pretrained parent network to a smaller
child model. Unlike standard knowledge distillation, which enforces uniform
imitation of teacher outputs, HKT draws inspiration from biological inheritance
mechanisms - such as memory RNA transfer in planarians - to guide a multi-stage
process of feature transfer. Neural network blocks are treated as functional
carriers, and knowledge is transmitted through three biologically motivated
components: Extraction, Transfer, and Mixture (ETM). A novel Genetic Attention
(GA) mechanism governs the integration of inherited and native representations,
ensuring both alignment and selectivity. We evaluate HKT across diverse vision
tasks, including optical flow (Sintel, KITTI), image classification (CIFAR-10),
and semantic segmentation (LiTS), demonstrating that it significantly improves
child model performance while preserving its compactness. The results show that
HKT consistently outperforms conventional distillation approaches, offering a
general-purpose, interpretable, and scalable solution for deploying
high-performance neural networks in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Predicting an individual's aging trajectory is a central challenge in
preventative medicine and bioinformatics. While machine learning models can
predict chronological age from biomarkers, they often fail to capture the
dynamic, longitudinal nature of the aging process. In this work, we developed
and validated a machine learning pipeline to predict age using a longitudinal
cohort with data from two distinct time periods (2019-2020 and 2021-2022). We
demonstrate that a model using only static, cross-sectional biomarkers has
limited predictive power when generalizing to future time points. However, by
engineering novel features that explicitly capture the rate of change (slope)
of key biomarkers over time, we significantly improved model performance. Our
final LightGBM model, trained on the initial wave of data, successfully
predicted age in the subsequent wave with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.515$ for
males, $R^2 = 0.498$ for females), significantly outperforming both traditional
linear models and other tree-based ensembles. SHAP analysis of our successful
model revealed that the engineered slope features were among the most important
predictors, highlighting that an individual's health trajectory, not just their
static health snapshot, is a key determinant of biological age. Our framework
paves the way for clinical tools that dynamically track patient health
trajectories, enabling early intervention and personalized prevention
strategies for age-related diseases.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing interest and adoption of LLMs, with
$\mu$Transfer becoming a key technique for tuning hyperparameters in
large-scale training. Meanwhile, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a
leading architecture in extremely large models. However, the intersection of
these two advancements has remained unexplored. In this work, we derive a
$\mu$-Parameterization ($\mu$P) for MoE, providing theoretical guarantees for
feature learning across model widths in both the router and experts. We
empirically validate our parameterization and further investigate how scaling
the number of experts and granularity affects the optimal learning rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电网和电表的普及提供了更精细的负荷数据，但多区域负荷预测面临区域、上下文和时间变化的挑战。

Method: 提出TriForecaster框架，结合混合专家（MoE）和多任务学习（MTL），引入RegionMixer和CTSpecializer层。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上，TriForecaster平均预测误差降低22.4%，并在中国东部17个城市成功部署。

Conclusion: TriForecaster在多区域电力负荷预测中表现出色，具有灵活性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Electric load forecasting is pivotal for power system operation, planning and
decision-making. The rise of smart grids and meters has provided more detailed
and high-quality load data at multiple levels of granularity, from home to bus
and cities. Motivated by similar patterns of loads across different cities in a
province in eastern China, in this paper we focus on the Multi-Region Electric
Load Forecasting (MRELF) problem, targeting accurate short-term load
forecasting for multiple sub-regions within a large region. We identify three
challenges for MRELF, including regional variation, contextual variation, and
temporal variation. To address them, we propose TriForecaster, a new framework
leveraging the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach within a Multi-Task Learning
(MTL) paradigm to overcome these challenges. TriForecaster features RegionMixer
and Context-Time Specializer (CTSpecializer) layers, enabling dynamic
cooperation and specialization of expert models across regional, contextual,
and temporal dimensions. Based on evaluation on four real-world MRELF datasets
with varied granularity, TriForecaster outperforms state-of-the-art models by
achieving an average forecast error reduction of 22.4\%, thereby demonstrating
its flexibility and broad applicability. In particular, the deployment of
TriForecaster on the eForecaster platform in eastern China exemplifies its
practical utility, effectively providing city-level, short-term load forecasts
for 17 cities, supporting a population exceeding 110 million and daily
electricity usage over 100 gigawatt-hours.

Motivation: 旨在通过减少可训练参数和优化隐藏激活，实现更高效的模型训练，同时保持高准确率。

Method: 使用闭式权重计算和梯度优化（Adam）更新原型，将可训练自由度从权重空间转移到数据/激活空间。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性、速度和模型大小之间取得了优越的平衡，优于其他基线方法。

Abstract: We present Proto-PINV+H, a fast training paradigm that combines closed-form
weight computation with gradient-based optimisation of a small set of synthetic
inputs, soft labels, and-crucially-hidden activations. At each iteration we
recompute all weight matrices in closed form via two (or more)
ridge-regularised pseudo-inverse solves, while updating only the prototypes
with Adam. The trainable degrees of freedom are thus shifted from weight space
to data/activation space. On MNIST (60k train, 10k test) and Fashion-MNIST (60k
train, 10k test), our method reaches 97.8% and 89.3% test accuracy on the
official 10k test sets, respectively, in 3.9s--4.5s using approximately 130k
trainable parameters and only 250 epochs on an RTX 5060 (16GB). We provide a
multi-layer extension (optimised activations at each hidden stage), learnable
ridge parameters, optional PCA/PLS projections, and theory linking the
condition number of prototype matrices to generalisation. The approach yields
favourable accuracy--speed--size trade-offs against ELM, random-feature ridge,
and shallow MLPs trained by back-propagation.

Abstract: Biomechanical features have become important indicators for evaluating
athletes' techniques. Traditionally, experts propose significant features and
evaluate them using physics equations. However, the complexity of the human
body and its movements makes it challenging to explicitly analyze the
relationships between some features and athletes' final performance. With
advancements in modern machine learning and statistics, data analytics methods
have gained increasing importance in sports analytics. In this study, we
leverage machine learning models to analyze expert-proposed biomechanical
features from the finals of long jump competitions in the World Championships.
The objectives of the analysis include identifying the most important features
contributing to top-performing jumps and exploring the combined effects of
these key features. Using quantile regression, we model the relationship
between the biomechanical feature set and the target variable (effective
distance), with a particular focus on elite-level jumps. To interpret the
model, we apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) alongside Partial
Dependence Plots (PDPs) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots. The
findings reveal that, beyond the well-documented velocity-related features,
specific technical aspects also play a pivotal role. For male athletes, the
angle of the knee of the supporting leg before take-off is identified as a key
factor for achieving top 10% performance in our dataset, with angles greater
than 169{\deg}contributing significantly to jump performance. In contrast, for
female athletes, the landing pose and approach step technique emerge as the
most critical features influencing top 10% performances, alongside velocity.
This study establishes a framework for analyzing the impact of various features
on athletic performance, with a particular emphasis on top-performing events.

Conclusion: 理论结果揭示了Transformer在事实召回任务中的优势，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has garnered significant attention for its ability
to grasp functions/tasks from demonstrations. Recent studies suggest the
presence of a latent task/function vector in LLMs during ICL. Merullo et al.
(2024) showed that LLMs leverage this vector alongside the residual stream for
Word2Vec-like vector arithmetic, solving factual-recall ICL tasks.
Additionally, recent work empirically highlighted the key role of
Question-Answer data in enhancing factual-recall capabilities. Despite these
insights, a theoretical explanation remains elusive. To move one step forward,
we propose a theoretical framework building on empirically grounded
hierarchical concept modeling. We develop an optimization theory, showing how
nonlinear residual transformers trained via gradient descent on cross-entropy
loss perform factual-recall ICL tasks via vector arithmetic. We prove 0-1 loss
convergence and show the strong generalization, including robustness to concept
recombination and distribution shifts. These results elucidate the advantages
of transformers over static embedding predecessors. Empirical simulations
corroborate our theoretical insights.

TL;DR: RankList是一种新颖的列表式偏好学习框架，扩展了RankNet，通过建模局部和非局部排序约束，提升了全局排序一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有成对偏好学习框架（如RankNet）在全局排序一致性上的局限性。

Method: 提出RankList框架，引入列表级监督和log-sum-exp近似以提高训练效率，并扩展了跳步比较以增强全局排序。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（如MSP-Podcast、IEMOCAP、BIIC Podcast和艺术图像美学数据集）上，RankList在Kendall's Tau和排序准确率上表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RankList为主观学习场景中的有序偏好建模提供了统一且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Preference learning has gained significant attention in tasks involving
subjective human judgments, such as \emph{speech emotion recognition} (SER) and
image aesthetic assessment. While pairwise frameworks such as RankNet offer
robust modeling of relative preferences, they are inherently limited to local
comparisons and struggle to capture global ranking consistency. To address
these limitations, we propose RankList, a novel listwise preference learning
framework that generalizes RankNet to structured list-level supervision. Our
formulation explicitly models local and non-local ranking constraints within a
probabilistic framework. The paper introduces a log-sum-exp approximation to
improve training efficiency. We further extend RankList with skip-wise
comparisons, enabling progressive exposure to complex list structures and
enhancing global ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method across diverse modalities. On benchmark SER datasets
(MSP-Podcast, IEMOCAP, BIIC Podcast), RankList achieves consistent improvements
in Kendall's Tau and ranking accuracy compared to standard listwise baselines.
We also validate our approach on aesthetic image ranking using the Artistic
Image Aesthetics dataset, highlighting its broad applicability. Through
ablation and cross-domain studies, we show that RankList not only improves
in-domain ranking but also generalizes better across datasets. Our framework
offers a unified, extensible approach for modeling ordered preferences in
subjective learning scenarios.

Motivation: 在联邦学习中，遗忘学习需要移除离开客户的数据贡献，但现有研究主要关注效率和有效性，忽略了效率和性能公平性。

Method: 提出FedShard算法，自适应解决收敛、遗忘效率和公平性之间的困境，并引入两种新指标量化公平性。

Result: FedShard在遗忘性能和效率上均表现出公平性，实验显示其遗忘速度比从头训练快1.3-6.2倍，比现有方法快4.9倍。

Conclusion: FedShard有效解决了联邦遗忘学习中的公平性问题，提升了效率和性能平衡。

Abstract: To protect clients' right to be forgotten in federated learning, federated
unlearning aims to remove the data contribution of leaving clients from the
global learned model. While current studies mainly focused on enhancing
unlearning efficiency and effectiveness, the crucial aspects of efficiency
fairness and performance fairness among decentralized clients during unlearning
have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce FedShard, the
first federated unlearning algorithm designed to concurrently guarantee both
efficiency fairness and performance fairness. FedShard adaptively addresses the
challenges introduced by dilemmas among convergence, unlearning efficiency, and
unlearning fairness. Furthermore, we propose two novel metrics to
quantitatively assess the fairness of unlearning algorithms, which we prove to
satisfy well-known properties in other existing fairness measurements. Our
theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation validate FedShard's fairness in
terms of both unlearning performance and efficiency. We demonstrate that
FedShard mitigates unfairness risks such as cascaded leaving and poisoning
attacks and realizes more balanced unlearning costs among clients. Experimental
results indicate that FedShard accelerates the data unlearning process 1.3-6.2
times faster than retraining from scratch and 4.9 times faster than the
state-of-the-art exact unlearning methods.

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务上取得最先进结果，仅需0.8k精选数据。

Conclusion: DED提供了一种高效且实用的方法，提升推理能力的同时保持通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities in
tasks such as algorithmic coding and mathematical problem-solving. Recent
methods have improved reasoning through expanded corpus and multistage training
combining reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. Although some
methods suggest that small but targeted dataset can incentivize reasoning via
only distillation, a reasoning scaling laws is still taking shape, increasing
computational costs. To address this, we propose a data-efficient distillation
framework (DED) that optimizes the Pareto frontier of reasoning distillation.
Inspired by the on-policy learning and diverse roll-out strategies of
reinforcement learning, the key idea of our approach is threefold: (1) We
identify that benchmark scores alone do not determine an effective teacher
model. Through comprehensive comparisons of leading reasoning LLMs, we develop
a method to select an optimal teacher model. (2) While scaling distillation can
enhance reasoning, it often degrades out-of-domain performance. A carefully
curated, smaller corpus achieves a balanced trade-off between in-domain and
out-of-domain capabilities. (3) Diverse reasoning trajectories encourage the
student model to develop robust reasoning skills. We validate our method
through evaluations on mathematical reasoning (AIME 2024/2025, MATH-500) and
code generation (LiveCodeBench), achieving state-of-the-art results with only
0.8k carefully curated examples, bypassing the need for extensive scaling. Our
systematic analysis demonstrates that DED outperforms existing methods by
considering factors beyond superficial hardness, token length, or teacher model
capability. This work offers a practical and efficient pathway to advanced
reasoning while preserving general capabilities.

Result: 现代ANN在多数任务中优于传统方法，TabPFN表现最稳健。

Conclusion: 推荐现代ANN（尤其是TabPFN）作为土壤预测建模的新标准工具。

Abstract: In the field of pedometrics, tabular machine learning is the predominant
method for predicting soil properties from remote and proximal soil sensing
data, forming a central component of digital soil mapping. At the field-scale,
this predictive soil modeling (PSM) task is typically constrained by small
training sample sizes and high feature-to-sample ratios in soil spectroscopy.
Traditionally, these conditions have proven challenging for conventional deep
learning methods. Classical machine learning algorithms, particularly
tree-based models like Random Forest and linear models such as Partial Least
Squares Regression, have long been the default choice for field-scale PSM.
Recent advances in artificial neural networks (ANN) for tabular data challenge
this view, yet their suitability for field-scale PSM has not been proven. We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates state-of-the-art ANN
architectures, including the latest multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based models
(TabM, RealMLP), attention-based transformer variants (FT-Transformer,
ExcelFormer, T2G-Former, AMFormer), retrieval-augmented approaches (TabR,
ModernNCA), and an in-context learning foundation model (TabPFN). Our
evaluation encompasses 31 field- and farm-scale datasets containing 30 to 460
samples and three critical soil properties: soil organic matter or soil organic
carbon, pH, and clay content. Our results reveal that modern ANNs consistently
outperform classical methods on the majority of tasks, demonstrating that deep
learning has matured sufficiently to overcome the long-standing dominance of
classical machine learning for PSM. Notably, TabPFN delivers the strongest
overall performance, showing robustness across varying conditions. We therefore
recommend the adoption of modern ANNs for field-scale PSM and propose TabPFN as
the new default choice in the toolkit of every pedometrician.

Abstract: Detecting whether any anomalies exist within a dataset is crucial for
effective anomaly detection, yet it remains surprisingly underexplored in
anomaly detection literature. This paper presents a comprehensive study that
addresses the fundamental question: When can we conclusively determine that
anomalies are present? Through extensive experimentation involving over three
million statistical tests across various anomaly detection tasks and
algorithms, we identify a relationship between the dataset size, contamination
rate, and an algorithm-dependent constant $ \alpha_{\text{algo}} $. Our results
demonstrate that, for an unlabeled dataset of size $ N $ and contamination rate
$ \nu $, the condition $ N \ge \frac{\alpha_{\text{algo}}}{\nu^2} $ represents
a lower bound on the number of samples required to confirm anomaly existence.
This threshold implies a limit to how rare anomalies can be before proving
their existence becomes infeasible.

Result: 在CiK基准测试中，这些策略在不同规模和家族的LLM上均优于直接提示方法。

Abstract: Forecasting in real-world settings requires models to integrate not only
historical data but also relevant contextual information, often available in
textual form. While recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can
be effective context-aided forecasters via na\"ive direct prompting, their full
potential remains underexplored. We address this gap with 4 strategies,
providing new insights into the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in this setting.
ReDP improves interpretability by eliciting explicit reasoning traces, allowing
us to assess the model's reasoning over the context independently from its
forecast accuracy. CorDP leverages LLMs solely to refine existing forecasts
with context, enhancing their applicability in real-world forecasting
pipelines. IC-DP proposes embedding historical examples of context-aided
forecasting tasks in the prompt, substantially improving accuracy even for the
largest models. Finally, RouteDP optimizes resource efficiency by using LLMs to
estimate task difficulty, and routing the most challenging tasks to larger
models. Evaluated on different kinds of context-aided forecasting tasks from
the CiK benchmark, our strategies demonstrate distinct benefits over na\"ive
prompting across LLMs of different sizes and families. These results open the
door to further simple yet effective improvements in LLM-based context-aided
forecasting.

Conclusion: PDM为扩散模型提供了一种高效且可扩展的视觉条件方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework for high-quality image
generation, offering stable training and strong performance across diverse
domains. However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly during
the iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion
alleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though
at the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as
Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning
denoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While
effective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and
retrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for
similarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype
Diffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly
into the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning -
without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM
constructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features
using contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by
aligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns,
enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show
that PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and
storage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based
conditioning in diffusion models.

resulting reservoir state dynamics are studied through the lens of linear
stability analysis, and we investigate diverse configurations for the temporal
residual connections. The proposed approach is empirically assessed on
time-series and pixel-level 1-D classification tasks. Our experimental results

Abstract: The new paradigm of test-time scaling has yielded remarkable breakthroughs in
Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g. reasoning models) and in generative vision
models, allowing models to allocate additional computation during inference to
effectively tackle increasingly complex problems. Despite the improvements of
this approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in
computation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications.
Given the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve
its benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose
one solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge
into a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided
test-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that
modulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework
for learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through
a tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model
while optimizing for desired characteristics. We show that our approach
recovers a substantial portion of the quality gains from explicit test-time
optimization at a fraction of the computational cost. Code is available at

Abstract: Graph incremental learning is a learning paradigm that aims to adapt trained
models to continuously incremented graphs and data over time without the need
for retraining on the full dataset. However, regular graph machine learning
methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental
learning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new
knowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the
previously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to
maintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however,
do not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different
timestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns
can be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the
new data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic
mixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a
DyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming
data blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data
sequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve
old tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the
number of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full
mixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a
sparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make
predictions, significantly reducing the computation time. Our model achieved
4.92\% relative accuracy increase compared to the best baselines on class
incremental learning, showing the model's exceptional power.

Abstract: We present two analytical formulae for estimating the sensitivity -- namely,
the gradient or Jacobian -- at given realizations of an arbitrary-dimensional
random vector with respect to its distributional parameters. The first formula
interprets this sensitivity as partial derivatives of the inverse mapping
associated with the vector of 1-D conditional distributions. The second
formula, intended for optimization methods that tolerate inexact gradients,
introduces a diagonal approximation that reduces computational cost at the cost
of some accuracy. We additionally provide four second-order numerical
algorithms to approximate both formulae when closed forms are unavailable. We
performed verification and validation studies to demonstrate the correctness of
these numerical algorithms and the effectiveness of the proposed formulae. A
nuclear physics application showcases how our work enables uncertainty
quantification and parameter inference for quantum correlation functions. Our
approach differs from existing methods by avoiding the need for model fitting,
knowledge of sampling algorithms, and evaluation of high-dimensional integrals.
It is therefore particularly useful for sample-based inverse problems when the
sampler operates as a black box or requires expensive physics simulations.
Moreover, our method renders arbitrary sampling subroutines differentiable,
facilitating their integration into programming frameworks for deep learning
and automatic differentiation. Algorithmic details and code implementations are
provided in this paper and in our open-source software DistroSA to enable
reproducibility and further development.

Abstract: Line graphs are an alternative representation of graphs where each vertex of
the original (root) graph becomes an edge. However not all graphs have a
corresponding root graph, hence the transformation from graphs to line graphs
is not invertible. We investigate the case when there is a small perturbation
in the space of line graphs, and try to recover the corresponding root graph,
essentially defining the inverse of the line graph operation. We propose a
linear integer program that edits the smallest number of edges in the line
graph, that allow a root graph to be found. We use the spectral norm to
theoretically prove that such a pseudo-inverse operation is well behaved.
Illustrative empirical experiments on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs show that our
theoretical results work in practice.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) within the framework of
probabilistic numerics offers a principled approach to quantifying epistemic
uncertainty arising from discretization. By leveraging Gaussian process
regression and imposing the governing PDE as a constraint at a finite set of
collocation points, probabilistic numerics delivers mesh-free solutions at
arbitrary locations. However, the high computational cost, which scales
cubically with the number of collocation points, remains a critical bottleneck,
particularly for large-scale or high-dimensional problems. We propose a
scalable enhancement to this paradigm through two key innovations. First, we
develop a stochastic dual descent algorithm that reduces the per-iteration
complexity from cubic to linear in the number of collocation points, enabling
tractable inference. Second, we exploit a clustering-based active learning
strategy that adaptively selects collocation points to maximize information
gain while minimizing computational expense. Together, these contributions
result in an $h$-adaptive probabilistic solver that can scale to a large number
of collocation points. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solver on
benchmark PDEs, including two- and three-dimensional steady-state elliptic
problems, as well as a time-dependent parabolic PDE formulated in a space-time
setting.

Abstract: The interpretability of generative models is considered a key factor in
demonstrating their effectiveness and controllability. The generated data are
believed to be determined by latent variables that are not directly observable.
Therefore, disentangling, decoupling, decomposing, causal inference, or
performing Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the latent variable space
helps uncover the independent factors that influence the attributes or features
affecting the generated outputs, thereby enhancing the interpretability of
generative models. As a generative model, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
combine with variational Bayesian inference algorithms. Using VAEs, the inverse
process of ICA can be equivalently framed as a variational inference process.
In some studies, Gaussian processes (GPs) have been introduced as priors for
each dimension of latent variables in VAEs, structuring and separating each
dimension from temporal or spatial perspectives, and encouraging different
dimensions to control various attributes of the generated data. However, GPs
impose a significant computational burden, resulting in substantial resource
consumption when handling large datasets. Essentially, GPs model different
temporal or spatial structures through various kernel functions. Structuring
the priors of latent variables via kernel functions-so that different kernel
functions model the correlations among sequence points within different latent
dimensions-is at the core of achieving disentanglement in VAEs. The proposed
Structured Kernel Regression VAE (SKR-VAE) leverages this core idea in a more
efficient way, avoiding the costly kernel matrix inversion required in GPs.
This research demonstrates that, while maintaining ICA performance, SKR-VAE
achieves greater computational efficiency and significantly reduced
computational burden compared to GP-VAE.
