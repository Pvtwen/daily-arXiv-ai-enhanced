Abstract: This paper presents a proposed AI Deep Learning model that addresses common
challenges encountered in Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems. In this
work, we run a Python simulation that models a basic VLC system primarily
affected by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). A Deep Neural Network (DNN)
is then trained to equalize the noisy signal received and improve signal
integrity. The system evaluates and compares the Bit Error Rate (BER) before
and after equalization to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
This paper starts by introducing the concept of visible light communication,
then it dives deep into some details about the process of VLC and the
challenges it faces, shortly after we propose our project which helps overcome
these challenges. We finally conclude with a lead for future work, highlighting
the areas that are most suitable for future improvements.

TL;DR: AFDM信号的模糊函数分析揭示了其在单静态和双静态设置中的范围和速度估计能力，展示了其在ISAC应用中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AFDM信号的模糊函数，以评估其在下一代无线网络（尤其是高移动性场景）中的范围和速度估计能力。

Method: 推导AFDM啁啾子载波的自动模糊函数（AAF）和交叉模糊函数（CAF），分析其局部和全局特性，并扩展到典型AFDM帧的模糊函数分析。

Result: AAF具有“尖峰状”局部特性和“周期性”全局特性，CAF类似但多普勒维度有偏移；插入保护符号可实现无干扰感知。

Conclusion: AFDM在ISAC应用中表现出强大潜力，仿真结果验证了理论分析。

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising chirp-based
waveform with high flexibility and resilience, making it well-suited for
next-generation wireless networks, particularly in high-mobility scenarios. In
this paper, we investigate the ambiguity functions (AFs) of AFDM signals, which
fundamentally characterize their range and velocity estimation capabilities in
both monostatic and bistatic settings. Specifically, we first derive the
auto-ambiguity function (AAF) of an AFDM chirp subcarrier, revealing its
"spike-like" local property and "periodic-like" global property along the
rotated delay and Doppler dimensions. This structure naturally forms a
parallelogram for each localized pulse of the AAF of the AFDM chirp subcarrier,
enabling unambiguous target sensing. Then, we study the cross-ambiguity
function (CAF) between two different AFDM chirp subcarriers, which exhibits the
same local and global properties as the AAF but with an additional shift along
the Doppler dimension. We then extend our analysis to the AF of various typical
AFDM frames, considering both deterministic pilot and random data symbols. In
particular, we demonstrate that inserting guard symbols in AFDM facilitates
interference-free sensing. Simulation results validate our theoretical
findings, highlighting AFDM's strong potential for ISAC applications.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究通过可穿戴设备测量PPG信号，评估不同部位（手腕和上臂）的ODI值作为睡眠呼吸暂停诊断的替代指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠呼吸暂停是常见慢性疾病，传统诊断需实验室多导睡眠监测，研究旨在探索更便捷的替代方法。

Method: 使用可穿戴设备在手腕和上臂测量PPG信号，计算ODI值，并与传统AHI指标对比。

Result: 上臂ODI值对中重度睡眠呼吸暂停的诊断准确率86%，灵敏度96%，特异性70%，优于手腕数据。

Conclusion: 上臂ODI值可作为睡眠呼吸暂停诊断的可靠替代指标，手腕数据可靠性较低。

Abstract: Sleep apnea is a common chronic sleep-related disorder which is known to be a
comorbidity for cerebro- and cardio-vascular disease. Diagnosis of sleep apnea
usually requires an overnight polysomnography at the sleep laboratory. In this
paper, we used a wearable device which measures reflectance
photoplethysmography (PPG) at the wrist and upper arm to estimate continuous
SpO2 levels during sleep and subsequently derive an oxygen desaturation index
(ODI) for each patient. On a cohort of 170 patients undergoing sleep apnea
screening, we evaluated whether this ODI value could represent a surrogate
marker for the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) for the diagnosis and severity
assessment of sleep apnea. As the ODI was simultaneously obtained at the
fingertip, upper arm and wrist, we compared ODI diagnostic performance
depending on the measurement location. We then further evaluated the accuracy
of ODI as a direct predictor for moderate and severe sleep apnea as defined by
established AHI thresholds. We found that ODI values obtained at the upper arm
were good predictors for moderate or severe sleep apnea, with 86% accuracy, 96%
sensitivity and 70% specificity, whereas ODI values obtained at the wrist were
less reliable as a diagnostic tool.

### [4] [Exploiting Cognition in ISAR Processing for Spectral Compatibility Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08423)
*Massimo Rosamilia,Augusto Aubry,Alessio Balleri,Antonio De Maio,Marco Martorella*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种认知逆合成孔径雷达（ISAR）方法，通过感知环境和动态设计雷达波形，实现在拥挤电磁环境中的频谱兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在拥挤的电磁环境中，传统雷达难以避免干扰其他射频源，因此需要一种能够动态适应环境并实现频谱兼容的解决方案。

Method: 方法包括环境感知（频谱传感模块）和动态波形设计（生成带频谱陷波的雷达波形），并利用压缩感知或秩最小化策略恢复缺失数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在13-15 GHz频段内实现了频谱兼容性，并生成了高质量的ISAR图像。

Conclusion: 该研究为拥挤电磁环境中的雷达系统提供了一种有效的频谱兼容解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces and analyzes the concept of a cognitive inverse
synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) ensuring spectral compatibility in crowded
electromagnetic environments. In such a context, the proposed approach
alternates between environmental perception, recognizing possible emitters in
its frequency range, and an action stage, synthesizing and transmitting a
tailored radar waveform to achieve the desired imaging task while guaranteeing
spectral coexistence with overlaid emitters. The perception is carried out by a
spectrum sensing module providing the true relevant spectral parameters of the
sources in the environment. The action stage employs a tailored signal design
process, synthesizing a radar waveform with bespoke spectral notches, enabling
ISAR imaging over a wide spectral bandwidth without interfering with the other
radio frequency (RF) sources. A key enabling requirement for the proposed
application is the capability to successfully recover possible missing data in
the frequency domain (induced by spectral notches) and in the slow-time
dimension (enabling concurrent RF activities still in a cognitive fashion).
This process is carried out by resorting to advanced methods based on either
the compressed-sensing framework or a rank-minimization recovery strategy. The
capabilities of the proposed system are assessed exploiting a dataset of drone
measurements in the frequency band between 13 GHz and 15 GHz. Results highlight
the effectiveness of the devised architecture to enable spectral compatibility
while delivering high-quality ISAR images as well as additional RF activities.

Abstract: Equalization-enhanced Phase Noise causes burst-like distortions in high

that captures these distortions by introducing a time-varying distortion power.
Validated through simulations and experiments, it enables accurate and simple
performance prediction for high symbol-rate transmission systems.

### [6] [Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resource Allocation with Peak Age of Information Violation Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08653)
*Berire Gunes Reyhan,Sinem Coleri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于优化理论的安全深度强化学习框架，用于超可靠无线网络控制系统，首次在文献中同时满足约束条件和性能优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线网络控制系统中控制与通信系统紧密相关，需协同设计以确保约束满足和性能优化。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：优化理论阶段推导最优条件，安全深度强化学习阶段通过师生框架指导代理。

Result: 仿真表明，该框架优于基于规则和其他优化理论的基准，收敛更快、奖励更高、稳定性更强。

Conclusion: 该框架为超可靠无线网络控制系统提供了一种有效的协同设计方法。

Abstract: In Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs), control and communication
systems must be co-designed due to their strong interdependence. This paper
presents a novel optimization theory-based safe deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) framework for ultra-reliable WNCSs, ensuring constraint satisfaction
while optimizing performance, for the first time in the literature. The
approach minimizes power consumption under key constraints, including Peak Age
of Information (PAoI) violation probability, transmit power, and schedulability
in the finite blocklength regime. PAoI violation probability is uniquely
derived by combining stochastic maximum allowable transfer interval (MATI) and
maximum allowable packet delay (MAD) constraints in a multi-sensor network. The
framework consists of two stages: optimization theory and safe DRL. The first
stage derives optimality conditions to establish mathematical relationships
among variables, simplifying and decomposing the problem. The second stage
employs a safe DRL model where a teacher-student framework guides the DRL agent
(student). The control mechanism (teacher) evaluates compliance with system
constraints and suggests the nearest feasible action when needed. Extensive
simulations show that the proposed framework outperforms rule-based and other
optimization theory based DRL benchmarks, achieving faster convergence, higher
rewards, and greater stability.

### [7] [Multi-Symbol Digital AirComp via Modulation Design and Power Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08670)
*Xiaojing Yan,Saeed Razavikia,Carlo Fischione*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多符号调制框架SeMAC，用于数字空中计算（AirComp），通过多时隙的灵活调制设计提升抗噪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ChannelComp框架在多接入信道（MAC）上支持任意函数计算，但缺乏跨多时隙的灵活调制设计，限制了抗噪能力。

Method: 提出SeMAC框架，将输入值映射到多时隙的调制符号序列，并通过非凸优化、SDP松弛和低秩近似设计调制方案。针对固定调制格式场景，开发了功率适配方案。

Result: 数值结果表明，SeMAC可将计算误差降低达18 dB，尤其在乘积函数计算中表现优异。

Conclusion: SeMAC通过多时隙调制和功率适配，显著提升了AirComp的可靠性和抗噪性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider digital over-the-air computation (AirComp) and
introduce a new multi-symbol modulation framework called sequential modulation
for AirComp (SeMAC). Building upon ChannelComp, a general framework for
designing modulation schemes to support arbitrary function computation over a
multiple access channel (MAC), SeMAC maps each input value to a sequence of
modulated symbols using distinct constellation diagrams across multiple time
slots. This extension generalizes ChannelComp by enabling flexible modulation
design across multiple transmissions, thereby enhancing reliability against
channel noise. We formulate the modulation design as a non-convex optimization
problem, apply matrix lifting to relax it into a semidefinite programming
(SDP), and recover a feasible modulation solution by solving a low rank
approximation. For scenarios where the modulation formats cannot be changed, we
further develop a power adaptation scheme that adjusts amplitude and phase of
the modulated symbols while preserving the modulation structure. Numerical
results show that SeMAC can achieve a reliable computation by reducing the
computation error up to 18 dB compared to other existing methods, particularly
for the product function.

### [8] [An Enhanced Privacy-preserving Federated Few-shot Learning Framework for Respiratory Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08050)
*Ming Wang,Zhaoyang Duan,Dong Xue,Fangzhou Liu,Zhongheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦少样本学习框架，结合隐私保护机制，解决呼吸疾病诊断中数据标注不足和隐私保护问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据标注的劳动密集性导致高质量标注数据集稀缺，且患者隐私问题限制了数据共享，传统集中式方法易泄露隐私。

Method: 采用元随机梯度下降算法防止数据不足导致的过拟合，并引入差分隐私噪声保护梯度信息，使用加权平均算法聚合本地模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保护隐私的同时，能有效诊断不同结构、类别和分布的呼吸疾病数据。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据稀缺和隐私保护的双重挑战下，为呼吸疾病诊断提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant
challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of
high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover,
patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data
across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which
rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study
proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving
mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection
in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient
descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises
from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for
neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient
leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is
integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local
data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the
impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across
various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to
aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the
adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show
that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of
differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using
data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

### [9] [Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator Can Solve Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization More Efficiently](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08053)
*Kenshin Abe,Yunzhuo Wang,Shuhei Watanabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对树结构Parzen估计器（TPE）的高效组合优化算法，通过改进分类核与数值核的结合，并优化大组合搜索空间的处理，从而在较少的评估次数下获得更好的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合优化在TPE中尚未被充分研究，但在化学和生物学等领域有重要应用。本文旨在填补这一空白，提升TPE在组合优化中的性能。

Method: 通过将分类核与数值核结合，引入距离结构，并针对大组合搜索空间优化核计算的时间复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的TPE在合成问题上能以更少的评估次数找到更好的解。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在Optuna框架中可用，为组合优化提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools
have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem
setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as
multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the
practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box
combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,
chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet
very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial
optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the
categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a
distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for
the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These
modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect
to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic
problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with
fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,
an open-source framework for HPO.

### [10] [Quantile Reward Policy Optimization: Alignment with Pointwise Regression and Exact Partition Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08068)
*Simon Matrenok,Skander Moalla,Caglar Gulcehre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QRPO是一种新方法，能够利用点式绝对奖励进行离线学习，避免了传统方法对在线或偏好数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DPO和REBEL只能利用偏好对或相对信号，而PPO和GRPO需要在线策略。QRPO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: QRPO通过分位数奖励实现KL正则化RL目标的闭式解回归，无需相对信号。

Result: QRPO在聊天和编码评估中表现优于DPO、REBEL和SimPO，且减少长度偏差。

Conclusion: QRPO为离线学习点式绝对奖励提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far
required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast,
simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and
REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To
bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}
(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the
simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile
rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized
RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function,
removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO
scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new
dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves
top performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores,
AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse
datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust
rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

### [11] [Low-rank Momentum Factorization for Memory Efficient Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08091)
*Pouria Mahdavinia,Mehrdad Mahdavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoFaSGD是一种动态低秩SVD优化的内存高效微调方法，解决了固定子空间和离线重采样问题，性能与LoRA相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型微调时，AdamW等状态优化器占用过多GPU内存，现有方法如LoRA和GaLore存在固定子空间或计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出MoFaSGD，动态更新低秩SVD表示一阶动量，支持自适应优化子空间更新和高效谱归一化更新。

Result: 理论证明MoFaSGD在非凸随机优化下达到最优收敛率，实验显示其在内存减少和性能上优于现有低秩优化方法。

Conclusion: MoFaSGD提供了一种内存高效且性能优越的微调方法，适用于大型语言模型对齐任务。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges
due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU
memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent
approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and
subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed
subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring
full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which
maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order
momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.
This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that
adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,
MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient
spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment
accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,
proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization
under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness
on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off
between memory reduction (comparable to LoRA) and performance compared to
state-of-the-art low-rank optimization methods. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/pmahdavi/MoFaSGD.

### [12] [PDE-aware Optimizer for Physics-informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08118)
*Hardik Shukla,Manurag Khullar,Vismay Churiwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于PDE残差梯度方差的优化器，解决了PINNs中损失项平衡问题，相比Adam和SOAP表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准优化器（如Adam）在PINNs中难以平衡损失项，尤其在刚性或病态系统中。

Method: 提出PDE感知优化器，根据PDE残差梯度方差调整参数更新。

Result: 在1D Burgers'、Allen-Cahn和KdV方程上表现优于Adam和SOAP，收敛更平滑且误差更低。

Conclusion: PDE残差感知自适应能有效提升PINNs训练的稳定性，未来需研究更大架构和硬件加速。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical
constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam
often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or
ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that
adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual
gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the
heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark
the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and
Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer
achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in
regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE
residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While
promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators
remains an important direction for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs的性能对采样点敏感，而高维问题中随机采样效果不佳，因此需要更高效的采样方法。

Method: 采用低差异序列（准蒙特卡洛方法）进行采样，提出QRPINNs，并结合自适应采样进一步优化。

Result: 理论证明QRPINNs收敛速度更快，实验显示其在高维PDE中显著优于PINNs和自适应采样方法。

Conclusion: QRPINNs是一种高效且性能优越的PINNs改进方法，尤其适用于高维PDE问题。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical constraints into neural
network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points.
Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high
dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of
random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven
to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments
demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative
adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore,
combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINN无法严格满足约束，导致工程系统中预测的可靠性下降。

Result: 在测试问题和实际化学过程模拟中，KKT-Hardnet比多层感知机和传统PINN具有更高的准确性和严格的约束满足性。

Conclusion: KKT-Hardnet通过严格约束满足，为复杂系统的可靠混合建模提供了新方法。

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict
constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor
violations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and
consistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN
architecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality
constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the
feasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a
distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT
conditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse
system with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection
differentiable. We apply KKT-Hardnet on both test problems and a real-world
chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs,
KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction. This
approach allows the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning
towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

Conclusion: 该方法无需函数估计、神经网络训练或噪声注入，具有创新性。

Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent
functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such
function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we
avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free
generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically
updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to
arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function
estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed
method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles.
We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be
leveraged to develop novel generative methods.

Conclusion: ALCo-FM在大型城市风险预测中表现出色，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Traffic accidents are rare, yet high-impact events that require long-context
multimodal reasoning for accurate risk forecasting. In this paper, we introduce
ALCo-FM, a unified adaptive long-context foundation model that computes a
volatility pre-score to dynamically select context windows for input data and
encodes and fuses these multimodal data via shallow cross attention. Following
a local GAT layer and a BigBird-style sparse global transformer over H3
hexagonal grids, coupled with Monte Carlo dropout for confidence, the model
yields superior, well-calibrated predictions. Trained on data from 15 US cities
with a class-weighted loss to counter label imbalance, and fine-tuned with
minimal data on held-out cities, ALCo-FM achieves 0.94 accuracy, 0.92 F1, and

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合测试时适应（TTA）与风险监控框架的方法，以检测模型性能的最终失效点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时数据偏移是部署预测模型时的常见挑战，TTA虽能暂时解决问题，但模型最终可能失效。需要一种方法来监控性能并预警。

Method: 扩展了基于顺序测试的监控工具，结合置信序列，适应模型在测试时更新且无标签数据的情况。

Result: 提出的TTA监控框架在多种数据集、分布偏移类型和TTA方法中均有效。

Conclusion: 结合TTA与风险监控框架能有效检测模型失效点，为模型维护提供统计严谨的解决方案。

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when
deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this
issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data.
While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution.
Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline
and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing
TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise
alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we
extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence
sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time
and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of
interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk
monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA
monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution
shift types, and TTA methods.

Result: 在Eedi和LLM-Sim数据集上，Text-LENS在未见项目上的预测性能优于LENS。

Conclusion: Text-LENS能有效学习学生能力并预测新项目上的表现。

Abstract: Machine learning has been proposed as a way to improve educational assessment
by making fine-grained predictions about student performance and learning
relationships between items. One challenge with many machine learning
approaches is incorporating new items, as these approaches rely heavily on
historical data. We develop Text-LENS by extending the LENS partial variational
auto-encoder for educational assessment to leverage item text embeddings, and
explore the impact on predictive performance and generalization to previously
unseen items. We examine performance on two datasets: Eedi, a publicly
available dataset that includes item content, and LLM-Sim, a novel dataset with
test items produced by an LLM. We find that Text-LENS matches LENS' performance
on seen items and improves upon it in a variety of conditions involving unseen
items; it effectively learns student proficiency from and makes predictions
about student performance on new items.

Result: 量子增强SVM在所有情绪类别中表现更优，F1分数超过80%，召回率提升最高达36%。

Conclusion: 量子机器学习结合可穿戴传感器数据，为临床和辅助生活场景中的被动情绪监测奠定基础。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from
physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to
conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison
of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning
(QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the
quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification
performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited
datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of
36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data
with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but
also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds
promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as
individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans
with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early
foundation for passive emotional monitoring in clinical and assisted living

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括多模态、生成式AI驱动的可扩展因果框架，旨在推动可解释、自适应的异常检测系统发展。

Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially
distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become
a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role
in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current
data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face
challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and
robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a
causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially
distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect
relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph
profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each
offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures
across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as
water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early
warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of
black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda
centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal
frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,
adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We
hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting
causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected
infrastructures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CoT方法依赖启发式采样，缺乏对推理转移的结构化建模，限制了推理轨迹的多样性和有效性探索。

Method: CTRLS将CoT推理建模为MDP，利用潜在状态转移和分布强化学习，结合epsilon-greedy探索和熵正则化。

Result: 实验显示在基准推理任务中，推理准确性、多样性和探索效率均有提升。

Conclusion: CTRLS通过结构化建模和强化学习，显著改进了CoT推理的探索能力和性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to
break down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps,
significantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks.
However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured
modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically
explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this
work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov
decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and
state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling
reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our
approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust
exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an
on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy
exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state
transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.
Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically
grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further
experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and
exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法依赖梯度信息，导致优化问题从离散空间松弛为连续空间，结果远离最优解，且无法适应不可微目标。

Method: 引入进化算法的简单增强，直接解决离散优化问题，支持任何黑盒模型和目标，无需可微代理损失。

Result: EvA攻击在实验中平均比现有最佳攻击多降低11%的准确率，并设计了两种新攻击方法。

Conclusion: EvA揭示了攻击设计的未开发潜力，适用于更广泛的攻击场景。

Abstract: Even a slight perturbation in the graph structure can cause a significant
drop in the accuracy of graph neural networks (GNNs). Most existing attacks
leverage gradient information to perturb edges. This relaxes the attack's
optimization problem from a discrete to a continuous space, resulting in
solutions far from optimal. It also restricts the adaptability of the attack to
non-differentiable objectives. Instead, we introduce a few simple yet effective
enhancements of an evolutionary-based algorithm to solve the discrete
optimization problem directly. Our Evolutionary Attack (EvA) works with any
black-box model and objective, eliminating the need for a differentiable proxy
loss. This allows us to design two novel attacks that reduce the effectiveness
of robustness certificates and break conformal sets. The memory complexity of
our attack is linear in the attack budget. Among our experiments, EvA shows
$\sim$11\% additional drop in accuracy on average compared to the best previous
attack, revealing significant untapped potential in designing attacks.

Conclusion: InsightBuild能有效帮助设施管理者诊断和缓解能源效率问题。

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but
facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We
propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.

Abstract: Human state detection and behavior prediction have seen significant
advancements with the rise of machine learning and multimodal sensing
technologies. However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility
scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area.
Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets
available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to
train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a
self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing
physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse
tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior
dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the
data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial
behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent
vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.

Motivation: 传统聚类算法通常仅关注数据密度或几何复杂性，而忽略了二者之间的相互作用。本文旨在利用这种相互作用提升聚类效果。

Method: CoreSPECT框架通过选择关键区域应用简单算法（如K-Means和GMM），并利用基于邻域图的多层传播方法扩展分区。

Result: 在15个数据集上测试，K-Means的ARI平均提升40%，GMM提升14%，性能优于基于流形和密度的算法。

Conclusion: CoreSPECT框架有效结合了分布与几何特性，显著提升了聚类性能，并具备理论保证和抗噪能力。

Abstract: Density and geometry have long served as two of the fundamental guiding
principles in clustering algorithm design, with algorithm usually focusing
either on the density structure of the data (e.g., HDBSCAN and Density Peak
Clustering) or the complexity of underlying geometry (e.g., manifold clustering
algorithms).
  In this paper, we identify and formalize a recurring but often overlooked
interaction between distribution and geometry and leverage this insight to
design our clustering enhancement framework CoreSPECT (Core Space
Projection-based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques). Our framework boosts
the performance of simple algorithms like K-Means and GMM by applying them to
strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a
complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based
multi-layer propagation procedure.
  We apply our framework on 15 datasets from three different domains and obtain
consistent and substantial gain in clustering accuracy for both K-Means and
GMM. On average, our framework improves the ARI of K-Means by 40% and of GMM by
14%, often surpassing the performance of both manifold-based and recent
density-based clustering algorithms. We further support our framework with
initial theoretical guarantees, ablation to demonstrate the usefulness of the
individual steps and with evidence of robustness to noise.

Conclusion: 量子增强表示在复杂数据填补任务中展现出巨大潜力，适用于近期量子硬件。

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets,
significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance
on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,
non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing
numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces
Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into
an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing
conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by
an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the
model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement,
thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing
the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark
mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by
up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy
by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art
classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the
profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data
imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a
systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and
efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and
effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL
from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,
not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy
to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency
while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending
SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that
the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The
efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on
challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the
strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the
community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically
efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will

Abstract: Dimensional synthesis of planar four-bar mechanisms is a challenging inverse
problem in kinematics, requiring the determination of mechanism dimensions from
desired motion specifications. We propose a data-driven framework that bypasses
traditional equation-solving and optimization by leveraging supervised
learning. Our method combines a synthetic dataset, an LSTM-based neural network
for handling sequential precision points, and a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture tailored to different linkage types. Each expert model is trained
on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both
single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates
prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show
our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various
configurations. This enables intuitive and efficient mechanism design, even for
non-expert users, and opens new possibilities for scalable and flexible
synthesis in kinematic design.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity
and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

Abstract: Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are
indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural
networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse,
high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes,
leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization
during training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights)
adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work
proposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based
Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of
quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric
learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit
neurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern
recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm
for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the
structure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm
incorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during
training process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated
against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of
heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior
prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27%
compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to
explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile,
interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the
complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic
models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning
and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic
models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models
mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic
models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse.
Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains
analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided
single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding
and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data
analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets
demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains
compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new
interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to
quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic
models. The results show that the interpretation provided by scE2TM performs
encouragingly in terms of diversity and consistency with the underlying
biological signals, contributing to a better revealing of the underlying
biological mechanisms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动化流程，利用机器学习和大型语言模型从文本中提取BPMN模型，并通过新标注的数据集提升训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将文本转换为BPMN模型时效率低且成本高，且难以处理并行结构。

Method: 提出了一种结合机器学习和大型语言模型的自动化流程，并扩展了PET数据集，新增了15个标注文档和32个并行网关。

Result: 该方法在重建准确性上表现良好，能够更好地捕捉并行结构。

Conclusion: 该方法为加速BPMN模型生成提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely
on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive
and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based,
still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel
structures in process descriptions.
  This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from
text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key
contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset,
which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the
PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways
for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets.
This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common
but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates
adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising
foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

Motivation: 前车变道行为对自动驾驶车辆的运动规划影响重大，预测此类行为可提升安全性和效率。现有研究多集中于特定时间点的预测，而缺乏对时间区间内行为的预测及不同架构的比较。

Method: 使用公开数据集highD，提取特征后设计并实现了LSTM、CNN和Transformer三种网络架构，比较了不同输入配置下的性能。

Result: Transformer网络表现最优，准确率在82.79%到96.73%之间，且抗过拟合能力更强。

Conclusion: Transformer是预测变道行为的最佳选择，未来可进一步优化输入配置以提升性能。

Abstract: Lane changes of preceding vehicles have a great impact on the motion planning
of automated vehicles especially in complex traffic situations. Predicting them
would benefit the public in terms of safety and efficiency. While many research
efforts have been made in this direction, few concentrated on predicting
maneuvers within a set time interval compared to predicting at a set prediction
time. In addition, there exist a lack of comparisons between different
architectures to try to determine the best performing one and to assess how to
correctly choose the input for such models. In this paper the structure of an
LSTM, a CNN and a Transformer network are described and implemented to predict
the intention of human drivers to perform a lane change. We show how the data
was prepared starting from a publicly available dataset (highD), which features
were used, how the networks were designed and finally we compare the results of
the three networks with different configurations of input data. We found that
transformer networks performed better than the other networks and was less
affected by overfitting. The accuracy of the method spanned from $82.79\%$ to
$96.73\%$ for different input configurations and showed overall good
performances considering also precision and recall.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the
intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to
leverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This
review explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks
of classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We
introduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding,
quantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML
approaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is
well-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent,
and so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically
identified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis,
quantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically
evaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The
challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including
hardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are
discussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need
for quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic
benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical promise and practical
deployment. This comprehensive analysis underscores that while QML has
significant potential for specific applications such as quantum chemistry and
sensing, its broader utility in real-world scenarios remains contingent on
overcoming technological and methodological hurdles.

Conclusion: 两簇测试在树状可解释聚类和基于显著性的层次聚类中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine
learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two
subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually
generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic
two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values,
leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally
introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different
significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we
present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive
an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is
able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several
classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of
such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in
tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical
clustering.

Conclusion: OPT有效解决了离线预训练智能体在线微调的问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) aims to integrate the
complementary strengths of offline and online RL by pre-training an agent
offline and subsequently fine-tuning it through online interactions. However,
recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during
online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution
shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In
this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online
RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value
estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase,
Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored
specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and
SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range
of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for language
modeling, rivaling auto-regressive models by training-time scaling. However,
inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively
under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving
high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided
settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on
particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs
sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using
conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process
ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the
reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling
methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach
leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this
framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for
inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations,
particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our
method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on
reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in
accuracy under varying compute budgets.

Conclusion: RTNinja为随机电报噪声分析提供了稳健、可扩展的工具，适用于下一代纳米电子技术。

Abstract: Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in
nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect
sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional
analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual
interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here,
we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework
for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja
deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of
hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The
framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses
Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;
and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic
clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte
Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise
ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently
demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of
source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja
offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise
characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,
reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and
device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

Conclusion: KGRAG-Ex通过知识图谱显著提升了RAG系统的可解释性和事实基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by grounding
responses in external information, yet explainability remains a critical
challenge, particularly when retrieval relies on unstructured text. Knowledge
graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich
representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent
retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex,
a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by
leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information
extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and
semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs:
natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus
retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we
incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of
specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of
experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation
methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their
structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph
metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations
process.

Conclusion: RSS-MLP通过减少方差提升了MLP的泛化能力，实验和理论分析均支持其有效性和合理性。

Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is
extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we
establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of
empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model.
Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of
empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a
popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging
produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we
introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling
(RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method.
Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and
the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS,
respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison
experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss
functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis
illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

Result: Sophia训练损失最低，Lion训练最快，AdamW下游任务表现最好。

Conclusion: 不同优化器各有优势，需根据具体需求选择。

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and
achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major
variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an
evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better
generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a
single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens
constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we
tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base
architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three
optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest
training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours
but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.

Result: 新方法提供了更直接且标准化的可解释性评估，并与人类评估结果一致。

Conclusion: 建议社区采用更直接的方法评估稀疏编码器的可解释性。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for
machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they
are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use.
Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for
each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they
enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This
method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and
evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered.
In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of
sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural
language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and
potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we
compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human
evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for
the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.

Motivation: 化学反应的本质是电子的重新分配和重组，通常表现为电子转移或电子对的迁移。这些变化在物理世界中是离散且突然的，如原子电荷状态的变化或化学键的形成与断裂。

Method: 提出SynBridge，利用图到图的转换网络架构和离散流桥，通过键和原子的离散状态捕捉反应物和产物图之间的双向化学转化。

Conclusion: 消融研究和噪声调度分析表明，离散空间上的结构化扩散对反应预测有益。

Abstract: The essence of a chemical reaction lies in the redistribution and
reorganization of electrons, which is often manifested through electron
transfer or the migration of electron pairs. These changes are inherently
discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge
states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the
transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based
generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a
graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges
between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional
chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the
bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise
scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete
spaces for reaction prediction.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising capabilities for mobile
devices, but their deployment faces significant challenges due to computational
limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications.
This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on
mobile devices, evaluating llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of
running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads
on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R
while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization,
temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience.
Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU
resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU
and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for
image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device
responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical
profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks,
highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use
of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

Motivation: 顺序联邦学习（SFL）在数据异构环境下表现良好，但存在灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出SFedKD框架，采用多教师知识蒸馏，基于类别分布差异分配权重，并设计教师选择机制以减少冗余。

Result: 实验表明SFedKD有效缓解灾难性遗忘，优于现有联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: SFedKD为SFL提供了一种高效且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which
coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model via a
central server. Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL
training framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner
across clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data
heterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.
However, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting
in heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge
learned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL
framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called
SFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the
current round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled
Knowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign
distinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based
on the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.
Through this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training
efficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent
knowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge
distillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.
Based on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection
mechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge
space coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive
experiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in
SFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), aligning agent behavior with specific
objectives typically requires careful design of the reward function, which can
be challenging when the desired objectives are complex. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates
the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward
aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov
decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge
from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the
generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations,
such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio. Our approach applies to both
deterministic and stochastic settings and integrates seamlessly with
value-based and actor-critic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach effectively optimizes diverse objectives, highlighting its
versatility and potential for real-world applications.

*Tianyou Jiang*

TL;DR: 提出CircFormerMoE框架，基于transformer和混合专家模型，直接从植物基因组DNA预测circRNA，解决了现有方法依赖RNA实验数据、计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有circRNA识别方法依赖RNA-seq数据，计算成本高且无法直接从基因组DNA预测，植物circRNA剪接位点缺乏典型GT-AG模体，亟需高效深度学习模型。

Method: CircFormerMoE框架，结合transformer和混合专家模型，分为剪接位点检测（SSD）和剪接位点配对（SSP）两个子任务。

Result: 在10种植物基因数据上验证有效性，能发现未注释circRNA，并进行可解释性分析。

Conclusion: 提供快速准确的植物circRNA大规模发现工具，为植物功能基因组学和非编码RNA注释研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA
regulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on
high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based
algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face
several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA
sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high
computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are
inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is
even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the
canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep
learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.
Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far
lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for
predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of
two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing
(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant
species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering
previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability
analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing
to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational
method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a
foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA
annotation.

Result: 在NGSIM和HighD数据集上，预测误差分别降低了4.8%和31.2%，尤其在高风险场景表现更优。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可解释的风险感知预测，有助于提升自动驾驶系统的决策鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and
efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods
primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with
other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain
or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that
incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from
behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal
encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential
field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for
trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to
improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative
spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate
that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2%
respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk
scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware
predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving
systems.

TL;DR: AbbIE是一种新型递归Transformer编码器，动态调整计算资源，性能优于标准Transformer，零样本任务提升12%，困惑度提升5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过递归和动态计算资源分配，提升Transformer性能，避免仅依赖参数和token数量的扩展。

Method: 采用递归编码器架构，在潜在空间迭代，无需特殊数据集或训练协议，训练时仅需2次迭代。

Result: 零样本任务性能提升12%，语言困惑度提升5%，支持动态计算资源分配。

Conclusion: AbbIE为Transformer性能扩展提供了新途径，适用于不同复杂度的任务。

Abstract: We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a
novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture,
which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the
dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive
approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance
through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent
space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized
dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to
generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2
iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.
AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity
of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context
learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\%
improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new
avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on
model sizes up to 350M parameters.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在恶意软件分类中因概念漂移导致性能下降，而频繁更新需要高成本的真实标注。半监督学习利用未标注数据的方法尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出ADAPT算法，一种模型无关的半监督伪标签方法，适用于多种机器学习模型（如神经网络和树基算法）。

Result: 在五个恶意软件检测数据集上的实验表明，ADAPT性能优于基线模型和竞争基准。

Conclusion: ADAPT为机器学习模型在恶意软件检测中适应概念漂移提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models are commonly used for malware classification;
however, they suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept
drift. Adapting these models to changing data distributions requires frequent
updates, which rely on costly ground truth annotations. While active learning
can reduce the annotation burden, leveraging unlabeled data through
semi-supervised learning remains a relatively underexplored approach in the
context of malware detection. In this research, we introduce \texttt{ADAPT}, a
novel pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm for addressing concept drift.
Our model-agnostic method can be applied to various machine learning models,
including neural networks and tree-based algorithms. We conduct extensive
experiments on five diverse malware detection datasets spanning Android,
Windows, and PDF domains. The results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms baseline models and competitive benchmarks. This work paves the way
for more effective adaptation of machine learning models to concept drift in
malware detection.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种遥感框架，用于监测印度旁遮普邦的可持续水稻灌溉实践（如DSR和AWD），以解决水资源管理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水稻种植消耗大量淡水，而可持续灌溉实践（如DSR和AWD）可显著减少用水量。然而，缺乏相关数据阻碍了政策制定和资源分配。

Method: 结合Sentinel-1卫星影像和地面真实数据，开发分类系统，区分不同灌溉实践。

Result: 分类系统F1分数达78%，并能大规模映射DSR采用情况，与政府记录高度相关。

Conclusion: 该框架为政策制定者提供了监测可持续水资源管理实践的工具，支持干预措施和项目评估。

Abstract: Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical
water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable
irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and
drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping
secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a
key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited
data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking
and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework
to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a
region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect
essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's
Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained
approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their
field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with
Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and
irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing
DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior
knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR
adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with
district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)
with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool
to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and
measure program impacts at scale.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LoGIC的多智能体强化学习方法，用于无监督图像描述任务，通过预训练模型和轻量级组件实现了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有标注数据集已被用于训练大型视觉语言模型（VLMs），提升性能变得困难，因此需要探索无监督图像描述方法。

Method: 提出LoGIC，包含‘说话者’和‘倾听者’两个智能体，使用GRPO算法进行训练，结合预训练VLMs和LLMs，并尝试轻量级组件。

Result: 使用预训练模型时，BLEU得分达到46（比基线高2）；使用轻量级组件时，BLEU得分为31（比现有无监督方法高10）。

Conclusion: LoGIC在无监督图像描述任务中表现出色，为性能提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了不平衡协变量偏移这一复杂异质性，FedAKD旨在解决这一问题，平衡预测准确性与协作公平性。

Method: FedAKD包含客户端和服务器更新：客户端采用异步知识蒸馏策略处理误分类样本；服务器选择高置信度样本更新全局模型并聚合客户端模型。

Result: 在FashionMNIST、CIFAR10和真实EHR数据集上，FedAKD显著提升了协作公平性、预测准确性，并促进了客户端参与。

Conclusion: FedAKD通过理论分析和实验验证，有效解决了不平衡协变量偏移问题，为联邦学习中的协作公平性提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However,
existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of
heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of
this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous
Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate
prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server
updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge
distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that
while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across
clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This
suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified
samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional
knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model
fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update
the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The
server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a
theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public
datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records
(EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative
fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even
under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer的注意力机制在长序列上计算成本高（O(n²)），限制了其实际应用。WERSA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: WERSA结合了内容自适应的随机谱特征、多分辨率Haar小波和可学习参数，实现了线性时间复杂度的注意力机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，WERSA表现最佳，显著提升了准确率（如ArXiv分类提升1.2%），同时大幅降低训练时间和计算资源。

Conclusion: WERSA为长序列处理提供了高效且经济的解决方案，尤其适合资源有限的硬件，推动了可持续和可扩展的AI发展。

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

Motivation: 传统理论认为模型容量增加会导致过拟合，但实践中很少观察到全局过拟合。论文探讨是否存在局部过拟合现象，并研究其与双下降现象的关系。

Method: 提出一种衡量遗忘率的分数来检测局部过拟合；设计两阶段方法：先集成多个检查点，再蒸馏为单一模型，以恢复遗忘知识。

Result: 实验表明局部过拟合确实存在，且与双下降现象相关。提出的方法在标签噪声下优于原始模型和独立训练的集成模型。

Conclusion: 局部过拟合是深度学习中的新现象，两阶段方法（集成+蒸馏）能有效提升性能，同时降低训练和推理复杂度。

Abstract: Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected.
This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity
should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice.
But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions
of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the
forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local
overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input
space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without
conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent
phenomenon.
  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages
the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten
knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by
distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing
performance without added inference cost.
  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and
training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the
presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge
Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained
ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference
complexity.

Abstract: The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in
thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low
representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In
this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT)
framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to
introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT
framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat
rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT
framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under
different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust
as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to
estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of
the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data
of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization
analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide
ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of
the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the
data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that
enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI
adoption in thermal power systems.

Result: 在模拟和真实实验中，SPLASH显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SPLASH为从次优演示中学习复杂任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for
learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most
approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which
is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations
are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable
robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting
a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic
agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement
learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical
demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from
suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We
empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,
and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation
experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed
methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward
learning from suboptimal demonstrations.

Result: 两种正则化技术可部分替代，但精确组合对稳健性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更稳健的RL算法提供了方向，尤其是针对超参数敏感性。

Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a
first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD
incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that
enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer
that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While
PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain
scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay
between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds
on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two
regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is
critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the
potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly
with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在缓解灾难性遗忘和保持新任务性能方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过关注参数在训练平台期的动态，可以更有效地平衡新旧任务的学习。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new
tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge
overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization
techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve
previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep
learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final
training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire
training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity
(movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss
landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new
tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in
balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly
learned tasks.

Result: 在混沌系统中，自适应NVAR在预测精度和噪声鲁棒性上优于标准NVAR。

Conclusion: 自适应NVAR模型通过数据驱动的非线性学习，简化了参数调优并提升了性能。

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展量子傅里叶神经算子（QFNO）以支持更高维度和分布式计算，结合经典与量子资源提升效率。

Method: 采用分区傅里叶算子计算，结合经典与量子资源；使用单热编码将数据编码为量子态，并通过变分优化量子电路参数。

Result: 在Burgers方程和Navier-Stokes方程中，PHQFNO达到经典FNO的精度，且在不可压缩Navier-Stokes中表现更优，对输入噪声具有更好稳定性。

Conclusion: PHQFNO展示了量子-经典混合方法在科学机器学习中的潜力，尤其在复杂流体动力学问题中表现突出。

Abstract: We introduce the Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO),
a generalization of the Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (QFNO) for scientific
machine learning. PHQFNO partitions the Fourier operator computation across
classical and quantum resources, enabling tunable quantum-classical
hybridization and distributed execution across quantum and classical devices.
The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a
message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input
data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit
parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PHQFNO using
PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation,
incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PHQFNO
recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PHQFNO
achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts. Finally, we perform a
sensitivity analysis under input noise, confirming improved stability of PHQFNO
over classical baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种离散时间条件高斯库普曼网络（CGKN），用于高效状态预测和数据同化，适用于高维复杂动力系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对非线性部分观测系统，探索库普曼嵌入以发现潜在状态表示，使动力学条件线性化，便于数据同化与科学机器学习结合。

Method: 利用库普曼嵌入建立潜在状态表示，构建条件高斯系统，通过解析公式高效计算后验分布。

Result: 在多个非线性PDE问题中验证，CGKN在状态预测和数据同化方面表现优异，与现有SciML方法相当。

Conclusion: CGKN框架展示了科学机器学习与数据同化的统一，并扩展至设计优化、反问题和最优控制等应用。

Abstract: A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed in
this work to learn surrogate models that can perform efficient state forecast
and data assimilation (DA) for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems,
e.g., systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many
engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman
embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system
states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear,
i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the
observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for
which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be
efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA
facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the
modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine
learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN
is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with
intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation,
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with
which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable
performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and
provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework
also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML
models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization,
inverse problems, and optimal control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoSlim是一个基于机器学习的图简化框架，用于降低符号加速器的复杂性，通过随机森林分类修剪低影响力转换，显著减少自动机图密度，同时保持语义正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号加速器在基因组学、NLP和网络安全等领域广泛应用，但面临内存使用和路由复杂性的扩展性问题。

Method: AutoSlim使用随机森林分类，基于边缘分数和结构特征修剪低影响力转换，支持加权转换的自动化简化。

Result: 在NAPOLY+上评估，AutoSlim实现了FPGA LUT减少40%，转换修剪超过30%，并能扩展到比现有基准大一个数量级的图。

Conclusion: AutoSlim通过修剪有效缓解了硬件资源膨胀，并展示了硬件互连对成本的重要影响。

Abstract: Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in
domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators
face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity,
especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine
learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity
of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest
classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and
structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while
preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated
score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient
ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in
NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput,
and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs
and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of
magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how
hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that
AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.

Motivation: 离线强化学习中Q值外推误差是主要问题，线性外推尤其严重。

Method: 结合RS-LN和PA，提出PARS算法，逐步降低数据范围外的Q值。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中表现优于现有算法，尤其在AntMaze Ultra任务中显著成功。

Conclusion: PARS算法有效解决了Q值外推问题，提升了离线训练和在线微调的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation
errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation
of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To
mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the
data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization
(RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining
RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a
range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL
benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BlockFFN的新型MoE架构，通过改进路由设计和训练目标，提升了稀疏性和加速性能，适用于低资源设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE架构的路由不可微分且不灵活，稀疏性模式不利于低资源条件下的加速。

Method: 引入结合ReLU和RMSNorm的路由器，设计CLS感知的训练目标，并实现高效加速内核。

Result: BlockFFN在稀疏性和加速性能上优于基线，TLS达80%，8-token CLS达70%，设备上加速3.67倍。

Conclusion: BlockFFN通过改进路由和稀疏性设计，显著提升了MoE架构的性能和加速效率。

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

TL;DR: 提出GreedyLore算法，结合贪心压缩和误差反馈，首次为分布式学习中的低秩梯度压缩提供收敛保证，并实现线性加速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式优化中通信开销是主要瓶颈，现有低秩梯度压缩方法要么方差大（随机方法），要么缺乏收敛保证（贪心方法）。

Method: GreedyLore结合贪心压缩、误差反馈和半惰性子空间更新，确保压缩操作始终收缩。

Result: 理论证明GreedyLore在MSGD和Adam下达到$\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$的收敛速率，实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: GreedyLore首次为贪心低秩压缩提供收敛保证，并实现线性加速，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and
machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck.
Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are
approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising
remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy
compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly
chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical
performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving
strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this
gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression
algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees.
GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy
compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the
compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these
techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD
and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank
gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

TL;DR: ORAC方法通过乐观探索解决RaCRL中的保守性问题，优化奖励与风险的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RaCRL因风险规避导致探索保守，易陷入次优策略，无法最大化奖励或达成目标。

Method: ORAC通过最大化奖励值函数的上界和最小化风险值函数的下界，动态调整成本权重，鼓励探索。

Result: 实验表明ORAC避免了次优策略，显著改善了奖励与成本的权衡。

Conclusion: ORAC在连续控制任务中有效提升了性能与安全性。

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies
that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations
caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads
to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in
converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,
in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an
exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic
(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper
confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a
local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value
function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value
is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint
value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the
environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety
constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach
prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the
reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as
Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment
CityLearn.

Result: 新模型显著提高了鲁棒性，解决了虚假奖励问题。

Conclusion: 需要更可靠的LLM评估方法，作者发布了改进的奖励模型和训练数据。

Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large
language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred
over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We
release our robust, general-domain reward model and its synthetic training data

Motivation: 研究动机是揭示因果抽象在解释模型决策过程中的局限性，特别是线性映射假设的不足。

Method: 方法包括理论证明和实验验证，展示无限制对齐映射如何使因果抽象变得无意义。

Result: 结果表明，无限制的对齐映射会导致因果抽象失效，并提出非线性表示困境。

Conclusion: 结论指出，因果抽象不足以支持机制可解释性，未来需研究信息编码假设与因果抽象的关系。

Abstract: The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the
opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural
network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a
function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability
papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear
representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a
model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by
the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the
concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment
maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural
network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of
causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical
findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to
perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of
solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised
language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention
accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear
representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to
alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled
way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and
accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:
causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it
becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.
Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal
abstraction should lead to exciting future work.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种广义的Mallows模型，通过学习数据中的距离度量来改进排名学习，并开发了一种高效的采样和最大似然估计算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用固定距离度量（如Kendall's τ距离），缺乏从数据中学习距离度量的方法。不同场景下排名的变化（如体育比赛中的长距离交换）需要更灵活的距离度量。

Method: 提出广义Mallows模型，使用L_α距离度量，并开发了FPTAS采样算法和高效的MLE算法，联合估计中心排名、分散参数和最优距离度量。

Result: 证明了估计器的强一致性，并通过体育排名数据集验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 广义Mallows模型和提出的算法为排名学习提供了更灵活和高效的工具。

Abstract: \textit{Mallows model} is a widely-used probabilistic framework for learning
from ranking data, with applications ranging from recommendation systems and
voting to aligning language models with human
preferences~\cite{chen2024mallows, kleinberg2021algorithmic,
rafailov2024direct}. Under this model, observed rankings are noisy
perturbations of a central ranking $\sigma$, with likelihood decaying
exponentially in distance from $\sigma$, i.e, $P (\pi) \propto \exp\big(-\beta
\cdot d(\pi, \sigma)\big),$ where $\beta > 0$ controls dispersion and $d$ is a
distance function.
  Existing methods mainly focus on fixed distances (such as Kendall's $\tau$
distance), with no principled approach to learning the distance metric directly
from data. In practice, however, rankings naturally vary by context; for
instance, in some sports we regularly see long-range swaps (a low-rank team
beating a high-rank one), while in others such events are rare. Motivated by
this, we propose a generalization of Mallows model that learns the distance
metric directly from data. Specifically, we focus on $L_\alpha$ distances:
$d_\alpha(\pi,\sigma):=\sum_{i=1} |\pi(i)-\sigma(i)|^\alpha$.
  For any $\alpha\geq 1$ and $\beta>0$, we develop a Fully Polynomial-Time
Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) to efficiently generate samples that are
$\epsilon$- close (in total variation distance) to the true distribution. Even
in the special cases of $L_1$ and $L_2$, this generalizes prior results that
required vanishing dispersion ($\beta\to0$). Using this sampling algorithm, we
propose an efficient Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm that jointly
estimates the central ranking, the dispersion parameter, and the optimal
distance metric. We prove strong consistency results for our estimators (for
any values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$), and we validate our approach empirically
using datasets from sports rankings.

Motivation: 现有方法通常单独处理测量噪声或数据限制的不确定性，而CLEAR旨在平衡两者以实现更可靠的预测建模。

Method: CLEAR结合分位数回归（测量噪声）和PCS框架的集成（数据限制），通过两个参数γ₁和γ₂校准不确定性。

Result: 在17个数据集上，CLEAR相比单独校准的基线方法，区间宽度平均减少28.2%和17.4%，同时保持名义覆盖。

Conclusion: CLEAR在测量噪声或数据限制主导的场景中表现优异，显著提升了不确定性量化的性能。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification is critical for reliable predictive
modeling, especially in regression tasks. Existing methods typically address
either aleatoric uncertainty from measurement noise or epistemic uncertainty
from limited data, but not necessarily both in a balanced way. We propose
CLEAR, a calibration method with two distinct parameters, $\gamma_1$ and
$\gamma_2$, to combine the two uncertainty components for improved conditional
coverage. CLEAR is compatible with any pair of aleatoric and epistemic
estimators; we show how it can be used with (i) quantile regression for
aleatoric uncertainty and (ii) ensembles drawn from the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for epistemic
uncertainty. Across 17 diverse real-world datasets, CLEAR achieves an average
improvement of 28.2% and 17.4% in the interval width compared to the two
individually calibrated baselines while maintaining nominal coverage. This
improvement can be particularly evident in scenarios dominated by either high
epistemic or high aleatoric uncertainty.

Motivation: 批归一化（BN）在深度学习中广泛使用，但其均值和方差估计在对抗攻击下可能不稳定。Stein收缩估计能提供更优的估计，尤其在对抗攻击场景下。

Conclusion: Stein收缩估计显著提升了BN在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，为深度学习模型的稳定性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Batch normalization (BN) is a ubiquitous operation in deep neural networks
used primarily to achieve stability and regularization during network training.
BN involves feature map centering and scaling using sample means and variances,
respectively. Since these statistics are being estimated across the feature
maps within a batch, this problem is ideally suited for the application of
Stein's shrinkage estimation, which leads to a better, in the
mean-squared-error sense, estimate of the mean and variance of the batch. In
this paper, we prove that the Stein shrinkage estimator for the mean and
variance dominates over the sample mean and variance estimators in the presence
of adversarial attacks when modeling these attacks using sub-Gaussian
distributions. This facilitates and justifies the application of Stein
shrinkage to estimate the mean and variance parameters in BN and use it in
image classification (segmentation) tasks with and without adversarial attacks.
We present SOTA performance results using this Stein corrected batch norm in a
standard ResNet architecture applied to the task of image classification using
CIFAR-10 data, 3D CNN on PPMI (neuroimaging) data and image segmentation using
HRNet on Cityscape data with and without adversarial attacks.

Result: MIRRAMS在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，且在无缺失数据时也达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MIRRAMS是一个通用性强、鲁棒性高的学习框架，适用于半监督学习任务。

Abstract: In real-world data analysis, missingness distributional shifts between
training and test input datasets frequently occur, posing a significant
challenge to achieving robust prediction performance. In this study, we propose
a novel deep learning framework designed to address such shifts in missingness
distributions. We begin by introducing a set of mutual information-based
conditions, called MI robustness conditions, which guide a prediction model to
extract label-relevant information while remaining invariant to diverse
missingness patterns, thereby enhancing robustness to unseen missingness
scenarios at test-time. To make these conditions practical, we propose simple
yet effective techniques to derive loss terms corresponding to each and
formulate a final objective function, termed MIRRAMS(Mutual Information
Regularization for Robustness Against Missingness Shifts). As a by-product, our
analysis provides a theoretical interpretation of the principles underlying
consistency regularization-based semi-supervised learning methods, such as
FixMatch. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets show that
MIRRAMS consistently outperforms existing baselines and maintains stable
performance across diverse missingness scenarios. Moreover, our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance even without missing data and can be
naturally extended to address semi-supervised learning tasks, highlighting
MIRRAMS as a powerful, off-the-shelf framework for general-purpose learning.

Abstract: We study the linear bandit problem under limited adaptivity, known as the
batched linear bandit. While existing approaches can achieve near-optimal
regret in theory, they are often computationally prohibitive or underperform in
practice. We propose \texttt{BLAE}, a novel batched algorithm that integrates
arm elimination with regularized G-optimal design, achieving the minimax
optimal regret (up to logarithmic factors in $T$) in both large-$K$ and
small-$K$ regimes for the first time, while using only $O(\log\log T)$ batches.
Our analysis introduces new techniques for batch-wise optimal design and
refined concentration bounds. Crucially, \texttt{BLAE} demonstrates low
computational overhead and strong empirical performance, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in extensive numerical evaluations. Thus,
\texttt{BLAE} is the first algorithm to combine provable minimax-optimality in
all regimes and practical superiority in batched linear bandits.

Conclusion: 损失深度不仅易于解释，还能揭示数据与分类器复杂度之间的关系，为数据深度在高维环境中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Data depths are score functions that quantify in an unsupervised fashion how
central is a point inside a distribution, with numerous applications such as
anomaly detection, multivariate or functional data analysis, arising across
various fields. The halfspace depth was the first depth to aim at generalising
the notion of quantile beyond the univariate case. Among the existing variety
of depth definitions, it remains one of the most used notions of data depth.
Taking a different angle from the quantile point of view, we show that the
halfspace depth can also be regarded as the minimum loss of a set of
classifiers for a specific labelling of the points. By changing the loss or the
set of classifiers considered, this new angle naturally leads to a family of
"loss depths", extending to well-studied classifiers such as, e.g., SVM or
logistic regression, among others. This framework directly inherits
computational efficiency of existing machine learning algorithms as well as
their fast statistical convergence rates, and opens the data depth realm to the
high-dimensional setting. Furthermore, the new loss depths highlight a
connection between the dataset and the right amount of complexity or simplicity
of the classifiers. The simplicity of classifiers as well as the interpretation
as a risk makes our new kind of data depth easy to explain, yet efficient for
anomaly detection, as is shown by experiments.
