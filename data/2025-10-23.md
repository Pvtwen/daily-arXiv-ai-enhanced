*Tomer Shaked,Philipp del Hougne,George C. Alexandropoulos,Nir Shlezinger*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于AI辅助退火Langevin动态(ALD)的新型可编程信道快速优化方法，无需显式信道建模，通过深度展开ALD算法和零阶梯度训练实现复杂动态环境中的信道参数优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要基于简化的信道模型进行快速优化，但这些模型往往是真实信道的粗略近似。更精确的信道描述需要通过复杂模拟器或测量获得，这在实际应用中存在限制。

Method: 采用AI辅助退火Langevin动态(ALD)方法，通过深度展开ALD算法，利用深度神经网络估计得分梯度来优化信道参数。引入零阶梯度训练方法避免信道建模需求，并结合主动学习提升泛化能力。

Result: 在受丰富散射效应影响的RIS辅助场景中评估，结果表明AI辅助ALD方法能够实现有限延迟下的快速可靠信道参数调谐。

Conclusion: 该方法为可编程信道优化提供了一种无需显式信道建模的新途径，在复杂动态环境中表现出良好的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Emerging technologies such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) make
it possible to optimize some parameters of wireless channels. Conventional
approaches require relating the channel and its programmable parameters via a
simple model that supports rapid optimization, e.g., re-tuning the parameters
each time the users move. However, in practice such models are often crude
approximations of the channel, and a more faithful description can be obtained
via complex simulators, or only by measurements. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach for rapid optimization of programmable channels based on
AI-aided Annealed Langevin Dynamics (ALD), which bypasses the need for explicit
channel modeling. By framing the ALD algorithm using the MAP estimate, we
design a deep unfolded ALD algorithm that leverages a Deep Neural Network (DNN)
to estimate score gradients for optimizing channel parameters. We introduce a
training method that overcomes the need for channel modeling using zero-order
gradients, combined with active learning to enhance generalization, enabling
optimization in complex and dynamically changing environments. We evaluate the
proposed method in RIS-aided scenarios subject to rich-scattering effects. Our
results demonstrate that our AI-aided ALD method enables rapid and reliable
channel parameter tuning with limited latency.

*Haofan Dong,Houtianfu Wang,Hanlin Cai,Ozgur B. Akan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了网络克拉美-罗下界框架，分析太赫兹星间链路的性能极限，揭示硬件损伤、相位噪声和网络干扰对低轨星座感知精度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太赫兹星间链路在低轨星座中能实现前所未有的感知精度，但受到硬件损伤、指向误差和网络干扰的基本限制，需要系统性的性能分析框架。

Method: 开发了网络克拉美-罗下界框架，结合动态拓扑、硬件质量因子、相位噪声和协作效应，通过递归费舍尔信息分析。

Result: 发现三个关键洞察：硬件和相位噪声产生功率无关的性能上限和下限；干扰系数可实现机会性感知，增益达5.5dB；共享定时参考的测量相关性不会降低性能。

Conclusion: 亚毫米级测距需要硬件、振荡器和3D几何配置的协同优化，硬件质量因子需小于0.01，相位噪声需小于10^{-2}。

Abstract: Terahertz inter-satellite links enable unprecedented sensing precision for
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations, yet face fundamental bounds from hardware
impairments, pointing errors, and network interference. We develop a Network
Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (N-CRLB) framework incorporating dynamic topology,
hardware quality factor $\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$, phase noise $\sigma^2_\phi$, and
cooperative effects through recursive Fisher Information analysis. Our analysis
reveals three key insights: (i) hardware and phase noise create
power-independent performance ceilings ($\sigma_{\text{ceiling}} \propto
\sqrt{\Gamma_{\text{eff}}}$) and floors ($\sigma_{\text{floor}} \propto
\sqrt{\sigma^2_\phi}/f_c$), with power-only scaling saturating above
$\text{SNR}_{\text{crit}}=1/\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$; (ii) interference
coefficients $\alpha_{\ell m}$ enable opportunistic sensing with demonstrated
gains of 5.5~dB under specific conditions (65~dB processing gain, 50~dBi
antennas); (iii) measurement correlations from shared timing references, when
properly modeled, do not degrade performance and can provide common-mode
rejection benefits compared to mismodeled independent-noise baselines.
Sub-millimeter ranging requires co-optimized hardware
($\Gamma_{\text{eff}}<0.01$), oscillators ($\sigma^2_\phi<10^{-2}$), and
appropriate 3D geometry configurations.

*Anna Cetera,Sima Ghafoori,Ali Rabiee,Mohammad Hassan Farhadi,Yalda Shahriari,Reza Abiri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于视觉的抓握平台，使用EEG神经影像技术研究不同抓握类型（精确抓握、力量抓握、无抓握）在大规模脑网络中的神经活动模式，发现低频振荡在抓握类型解码中起关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然侵入式记录已成功解码与抓握类型规划和执行相关的局部神经活动，但非侵入性脑电图（EEG）捕获的宏观神经激活模式仍知之甚少，需要研究抓握类型特异性神经活动在大规模脑网络中的表现。

Method: 开发了新型视觉抓握平台，在自然视觉运动任务中分离抓握特异性规划和执行阶段，使用Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern（FBCSP）技术提取各阶段中具有区分性的频率特异性特征，并通过支持向量机（SVM）进行分类。

Result: 低频振荡（0.5-8 Hz）在规划和执行阶段都携带抓握相关信息，精确抓握vs力量抓握的分类准确率达75.3-77.8%，优于传统MRCP方法的61.1%。高频活动（12-40 Hz）显示阶段依赖性结果，抓握vs无抓握分类准确率达93.3%。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了低频振荡在使用非侵入性EEG解码抓握类型规划阶段中的作用，为理解基于视觉的抓握脑网络提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The vision-based grasping brain network integrates visual perception with
cognitive and motor processes for visuomotor tasks. While invasive recordings
have successfully decoded localized neural activity related to grasp type
planning and execution, macroscopic neural activation patterns captured by
noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) remain far less understood. We
introduce a novel vision-based grasping platform to investigate
grasp-type-specific (precision, power, no-grasp) neural activity across
large-scale brain networks using EEG neuroimaging. The platform isolates
grasp-specific planning from its associated execution phases in naturalistic
visuomotor tasks, where the Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP)
technique was designed to extract discriminative frequency-specific features
within each phase. Support vector machine (SVM) classification discriminated
binary (precision vs. power, grasp vs. no-grasp) and multiclass (precision vs.
power vs. no-grasp) scenarios for each phase, and were compared against
traditional Movement-Related Cortical Potential (MRCP) methods. Low-frequency
oscillations (0.5-8 Hz) carry grasp-related information established during
planning and maintained throughout execution, with consistent classification
performance across both phases (75.3-77.8\%) for precision vs. power
discrimination, compared to 61.1\% using MRCP. Higher-frequency activity (12-40
Hz) showed phase-dependent results with 93.3\% accuracy for grasp vs. no-grasp
classification but 61.2\% for precision vs. power discrimination. Feature
importance using SVM coefficients identified discriminative features within
frontoparietal networks during planning and motor networks during execution.
This work demonstrated the role of low-frequency oscillations in decoding grasp
type during planning using noninvasive EEG.

*Yining Li,Ziwei Wan,Chongjia Sun,Kaijun Feng,Keke Ying,Wenyan Ma,Lipeng Zhu,Xiaodan Shao,Zhenyu Xiao,Zhen Gao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了移动可重构天线（MARA）的统一建模框架，首次整合了几何可移动天线（GMA）和电磁可重构天线（ERA），研究了GMA、ERA和MARA的信道建模与频谱效率优化，并系统回顾了基于人工智能的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G无线通信系统向智能化和高可重构性发展，传统固定天线的局限性日益突出，GMA和ERA成为突破这一瓶颈的关键技术。但两者集成形成的"几何-电磁双重构"范式给信号处理带来了高维混合优化的严峻挑战。

Method: 提出了MARA的统一建模框架，整合GMA的几何优化和ERA的电磁重构，研究GMA、ERA和MARA的信道建模与频谱效率优化，并系统回顾基于人工智能的解决方案。

Result: 填补了现有文献在几何-电磁双重构下AI驱动信号处理范式缺乏全面综述的空白，为设计具有高频谱效率和灵活性的6G无线系统提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: 本文提出的MARA统一建模框架和AI驱动方法为6G无线通信系统的设计和优化提供了新的思路和理论支撑，有助于突破传统天线的性能瓶颈。

Abstract: As 6G wireless communication systems evolve toward intelligence and high
reconfigurability, the limitations of traditional fixed antenna (TFA) has
become increasingly prominent, with geometrically movable antenna (GMA) and
electromagnetically reconfigurable antenna (ERA) emerging as key technologies
to break through this bottleneck. GMA activates spatial degrees of freedom
(DoF) by dynamically adjusting antenna positions, ERA regulates radiation
characteristics using tunable metamaterials, thereby introducing DoF in the
electromagnetic domain. However, the ``geometric-electromagnetic dual
reconfiguration" paradigm formed by their integration poses severe challenges
of high-dimensional hybrid optimization to signal processing. To address this
issue, we integrate the geometric optimization of GMA and the electromagnetic
reconfiguration of ERA for the first time, propose a unified modeling framework
for movable and reconfigurable antenna (MARA), investigate the channel modeling
and spectral efficiency (SE) optimization for GMA, ERA, and MARA. Besides, we
systematically review artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions, focusing on
analyzing the advantages of AI over traditional algorithms in high-dimensional
non-convex optimization computations. This paper fills the gap in existing
literature regarding the lack of a comprehensive review on the AI-driven signal
processing paradigm under geometric-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration and
provides theoretical support for the design and optimization of 6G wireless
systems with high SE and flexibility.

### [5] [Generalized Modified Blake-Zisserman Robust Spline Adaptive Filter for Generalized Gaussian Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19256)
*Haiquan Zhao,Bei Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于广义修正Blake-Zisserman的鲁棒样条自适应滤波算法(SAF-GMBZ)，在广义高斯噪声环境下具有优越性能，并进一步开发了FcGMBZ算法用于主动噪声控制应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SAF算法在广义高斯噪声环境下性能下降，在脉冲噪声下存在显著的稳态失配问题，且未能有效处理异常值的不利影响。

Method: 提出了SAF-GMBZ算法，计算了步长的均值收敛范围和稳态均方误差，并基于此进一步开发了FcGMBZ算法用于主动噪声控制。

Result: 仿真结果验证了理论稳态MSE的准确性，SAF-GMBZ在NSI中GGN环境下表现出优越性，FcGMBZ在脉冲噪声环境下的ANC应用中有效。

Conclusion: SAF-GMBZ算法解决了传统SAF算法在噪声环境下的性能问题，FcGMBZ算法在主动噪声控制中具有良好的收敛精度和噪声消除能力。

Abstract: The spline adaptive filtering (SAF) algorithm-based information-theoretic
learning has exhibited strong convergence performance in nonlinear system
identification (NSI), establishing SAF as a promising framework for adaptive
filtering. However, existing SAF-based methods suffer from performance
degradation under generalized Gaussian noise (GGN) environment and exhibit
significant steady-state misalignment under impulse noise. Moreover, prior
research on SAF algorithms has not effectively addressed the adverse effects
caused by outliers. To overcome these challenges, the generalized modified
Blake-Zisserman robust spline adaptive filtering (SAF-GMBZ) algorithm is
proposed. Compared to conventional SAF algorithms, SAF-GMBZ exhibits superior
learning performance in GGN. Furthermore, the mean convergence ranges of the
step-sizes and the steady-state mean-square error (MSE) are calculated by
introducing the commonly utilized assumptions. To arrive at good convergence
accuracy and noise cancellation capability in active noise control (ANC)
application, the filter-c GMBZ (FcGMBZ) algorithm is further developed based on
SAF-GMBZ. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the theoretical
steady-state MSE, and the superiority of the SAF-GMBZ algorithm under GGN
environment in NSI, along with the effectiveness of the FcGMBZ algorithm in ANC
application under impulsive noise environment.

### [6] [A Study on Delay Assessment for Heterogenous Traffic in VANET](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19267)
*Shama Siddiqu,Indrakshi Dey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 比较802.11p和FROG-MAC两种VANET MAC协议的性能，FROG-MAC通过分片传输机制为紧急数据提供更早的信道访问，改善了延迟和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VANET中多优先级异构节点产生的数据需要差异化服务，现有802.11p协议在非关键数据传输时会阻塞紧急数据的信道访问，需要改进。

Method: 通过仿真评估802.11p和FROG-MAC的延迟和吞吐量性能。FROG-MAC将普通数据包分片传输，在分片间隔中允许紧急数据访问信道。

Result: FROG-MAC在延迟和吞吐量方面都优于802.11p，因为它能为紧急流量提供更早的信道访问。

Conclusion: FROG-MAC通过分片传输机制有效解决了VANET中紧急数据被阻塞的问题，在性能上优于标准802.11p协议。

Abstract: Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) comprise of multi-priority hetero-genous
nodes, both stationary and/or mobile. The data generated by these nodes may
include messages relating to information, safety, entertainment, traffic
management and emergency alerts. The data in the network needs dif-ferentiated
service based on the priority/urgency. Media Access Control (MAC) protocols
hold a significant value for managing the data priority. This paper studies a
comparison of 802.11p which is a standard PHY and MAC protocol for VANET with a
fragmentation-based protocol, FROG-MAC. The major design principle of 802.11-p
is to allow direct Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
communication without associa-tion, using Enhanced Distributed Channel Access
(EDCA) to prioritize safety-critical messages. However, if non-critical
messages already start to transmit, the nodes with critical data have to wait.
FROG-MAC reduces this delay by transmitting normal packets in fragments with
short pauses between them, al-lowing urgent packets to access the channel
during these intervals. Simula-tions have been performed to assess the delay
and throughput for high and low priority data. We report that FROG-MAC improves
both the performance parameters due to offering an early channel access to the
emergency traffic.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 使用物联网技术监测巴基斯坦高中教师的睡眠质量，发现大多数教师睡眠质量和认知功能较差，两者存在明显关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高中教师因工作压力大和多任务要求，经常面临睡眠质量和认知功能问题，这对教学能力产生负面影响。

Method: 使用配备脉搏率和血氧传感器的智能手表监测睡眠质量，并结合认知评估问卷进行自我评估，研究涵盖208名巴基斯坦高中教师。

Result: 研究发现大多数教师睡眠质量和认知功能较差，两者之间存在明显关联。

Conclusion: 教师的工作负荷和其他因素需要改善，以确保他们的福祉，这将反过来对教学质量产生积极影响。

Abstract: Sleep quality is an important indicator of the efficient cognitive function
for high school teachers. Due to the high work stress and multi-tasking
expectations, the teachers often face issues with their sleep quality and
cognitive function, which has a clearly negative influence on their teaching
abilities. In this work, we propose a unique but simple method of deploying
Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the sleep quality of high school
teachers at Pakistan. Smart watches embedded with pulse rate and SpO2 sensors
were used to collect data and categorize the sleep quality as "poor", "fair" or
"good". Moreover, we used a psychological tool, Cognitive Assessment
Questionnaire (CAQ) for the self-assessment of teachers' cognitive function.
The study was conducted over 208 high school teachers from across Pakistan. It
has been found that most of the teachers had a poor sleep quality and cognitive
function; The link between these two variables indicate that the workload and
other factors must be improved for the teachers to ensure their well-being,
which will in turn have a positive impact on their teaching quality.

Conclusion: 证明了在增材制造中应用低功耗神经形态芯片进行边缘异常检测的可行性，并建立了相应的处理框架。

Abstract: This study is the first application of spiking neural networks (SNNs) for
anomaly detection in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing
process. The neural networks were used to identify print processing anomalies
generated by dropping of laser energy during the printing of individual layers
in a Ti-6Al-4V alloy lattice structures. Associated changes in the laser
generated melt pool were observed using an in-process photodiode monitoring
technique. photodiode sensors capturing plasma and infrared radiations
reflected from the print bed of the metal 3D printer were utilized to detect
sudden changes caused by anomalies during the printing process. The algorithm
is first implemented on non-neuromorphic hardware including a central
processing unit (CPU), on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and then on
neuromorphic Intel's Loihi chip. Improved detection of anomalies is achieved by
adjusting the spike latency of the neural network, which reduces masking of
information by noise within the monitored temporal signal. The work
demonstrates the possibility of using low-power neuromorphic chips within an
edge framework for anomaly detection in additive manufacturing and creates a
framework for the process.

Motivation: 解决AI与IoT融合中多边缘协同推理系统的隐私和带宽限制问题，避免固定压缩比特征传输导致的通信资源利用效率低下。

Method: 采用率自适应量化方案动态调整特征提取码率，基于特征对下游推理任务的重要性；使用动态规划方法在离散码率选项间分配码率。

Result: 在多视图数据集上的实验表明，该框架显著优于固定率量化框架，在有限带宽条件下实现了通信效率与推理性能的良好平衡。

Conclusion: 所提出的动态码率调整框架有效解决了多边缘协同推理系统中的通信效率问题，为AIoT应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with the internet of things
(IoT) enables task-oriented communication for multi-edge cooperative inference
system, where edge devices transmit extracted features of local sensory data to
an edge server to perform AI-driven tasks. However, the privacy concerns and
limited communication bandwidth pose fundamental challenges, since simultaneous
transmission of extracted features with a single fixed compression ratio from
all devices leads to severe inefficiency in communication resource utilization.
To address this challenge, we propose a framework that dynamically adjusts the
code rate in feature extraction based on its importance to the downstream
inference task by adopting a rate-adaptive quantization (RAQ) scheme.
Furthermore, to select the code rate for each edge device under limited
bandwidth constraint, a dynamic programming (DP) approach is leveraged to
allocate the code rate across discrete code rate options. Experiments on
multi-view datasets demonstrate that the proposed frameworks significantly
outperform the frameworks using fixed-rate quantization, achieving a favorable
balance between communication efficiency and inference performance under
limited bandwidth conditions.

Abstract: This paper investigates narrow-beam channel characterization and performance
evaluation for 5G for railway (5G-R) systems based on ray-tracing (RT)
simulation. Three representative high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios including
viaduct, cutting, and station are established, and RT-based dynamic narrow-beam
channel simulations are conducted using a designed beam tracking scheme that
ensures continuous alignment with the moving train. The channel characteristics
are analyzed in terms of both large-scale and small-scale fading, as well as
non-stationarity, providing statistical insights into path loss, shadow fading,
fading severity, time-frequency-space dispersion, and stationarity interval.
The influence of beamwidth on these channel properties is also examined.
Furthermore, the performance of 5G-R systems operating in such narrow-beam
channels is evaluated using the Vienna 5G simulator, with a focus on block
error rate, throughput, and spectral efficiency. A hardware-in-the-loop
simulation platform is developed to further assess synchronization signal
reference signal received power, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, and
reference signal received quality. The results provide valuable guidance for
the design and optimization of 5G-R systems in HSR environments.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，为推进6G高速移动通信研究提供了有益见解。

Abstract: Channel measurements are the prerequisite for applying emerging transmission
technologies and designing communication systems. In sixth-generation (6G)
system, conventional time or frequency domain channel sounding methods cannot
directly obtain Doppler information induced by high-mobility scenarios. The
channel spreading function (CSF) simultaneously captures delay and Doppler
information, while naturally characterizing the propagation environment in the
delay-Doppler (DD) domain. However, DD domain channel sounding methods remain
underexplored. This paper presents a novel DD domain channel sounding method
for 6G high-mobility scenarios. First, we introduce the waveform design for the
sounding signal and analyze its sounding capability. Next, the methodology of
DD domain channel sounding, including synchronization and CSF estimation, is
thoroughly detailed. Additionally, an algorithm for enhancing measurement
precision is proposed. The performance of the proposed method is rigorously
evaluated. Subsequently, a DD domain channel sounding system competent for 6G
high-mobility scenarios is established. Finally, DD domain channel measurements
are conducted for a vehicle-to-infrastructure scenario in urban environments.
Measurement results, including CSF, power delay profile, Doppler power spectral
density, number of multipath components, and other characteristics, are
derived, which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and offer
helpful insights for advancing research on 6G high-mobility communications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决5G网络中基于TDoA的无人机定位系统在低空城市环境中的安全漏洞，特别是针对现有检测方法无法识别的合并峰值欺骗攻击。

Method: 方法包括：优化A2G信道条件下的节点选择策略；提出轻量级UE辅助方案；设计合并峰值欺骗攻击模型；开发基于LMF的异常检测框架和递归梯度下降鲁棒定位算法。

Result: 研究结果表明：节点选择策略的有效性取决于无人机高度和部署密度；合并峰值欺骗攻击能够绕过现有检测；提出的安全框架能同时实现受害者定位和欺骗者定位。

Abstract: This paper investigates security vulnerabilities and countermeasures for 3rd
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Fifth Generation New Radio (5G-NR) Time
Difference of Arrival (TDoA)-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization
in low-altitude urban environments. We first optimize node selection strategies
under Air to Ground (A2G) channel conditions, proving that optimal selection
depends on UAV altitude and deployment density. We propose lightweight User
Equipment (UE)-assisted that reduce overhead while enhancing accuracy. We then
expose critical security vulnerabilities by introducing merged-peak spoofing
attacks where rogue UAVs transmit multiple lower-power pulses that merge with
legitimate signals, bypassing existing detection methods. Through theoretical
modeling and sensitivity analysis, we quantify how synchronization quality and
geometric factors determine spoofing success probability, revealing fundamental
weaknesses in current 3GPP positioning frameworks. To address these
vulnerabilities, we design a network-centric anomaly detection framework at the
Localization Management Function (LMF) using existing 3GPP-specified
parameters, coupled with a recursive gradient descent-based robust localization
algorithm that filters anomaly data while estimating UAV position. Our unified
framework simultaneously provides robust victim localization and spoofer
localization-capabilities not integrated in existing literature. Extensive
simulations validate the effectiveness of both optimization and security
mechanisms for 3GPP-compliant UAV positioning.

### [13] [On the Robustness of AFDM and OTFS Against Passive Eavesdroppers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19525)
*Vincent Savaux,Hyeon Seok Rou,Zeping Sui,Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu,Zilong Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文比较了AFDM和OTFS波形对被动窃听者的鲁棒性，分析表明AFDM具有更强的抗窃听能力，其暴力破解复杂度为O(N²)，而OTFS仅为O(√N)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AFDM和正交时频空间(OTFS)波形在被动窃听场景下的安全性，评估当窃听者缺乏chirp参数或延迟-多普勒网格配置知识时，通过暴力解调破解信号的难度。

Method: 通过理论分析计算AFDM和OTFS的暴力解调复杂度，并进行误码率仿真验证分析结果。假设窃听者不知道chirp参数或延迟-多普勒网格配置，必须穷举搜索所有可能的解调矩阵。

Result: 理论分析显示OTFS的暴力破解复杂度为O(√N)，而AFDM为O(N²)，其中N为子载波数。误码率仿真证实AFDM信号在窃听端几乎无法解码，而OTFS在同等条件下允许部分信号恢复。

Conclusion: AFDM在抗被动窃听方面优于OTFS，其更高的暴力破解复杂度提供了更强的安全保护，使得信号在窃听端难以被成功解码。

Abstract: We investigate the robustness of affine frequency division multiplexing
(AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveforms against passive
eavesdroppers performing brute-force demodulation to intercepted signals, under
the assumption that eavesdroppers have no knowledge of chirp parameters (in
AFDM) or the delay-Doppler grid configuration (in OTFS), such that they must
search exhaustively over possible demodulation matrices. Analytical results
show that the brute-force complexity scales as $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ for OTFS
and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ for AFDM, where $N$ is the number of subcarriers,
indicating that AFDM has superior resilience over OTFS. Bit error rate (BER)
simulations confirm the analysis by showing that, with AFDM, the signal remains
nearly undecodable at the eavesdropper, while OTFS allows partial signal
recovery under equivalent conditions.

*Sahar Maleki,Reza Lashgari,Mahdi Aliyari Shoorehdeli,Mohammad Komareji*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出使用MLP神经网络作为新方法，比传统模型能更好地拟合局部场电位对亮度对比刺激的响应曲线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 局部场电位（LFP）是研究神经元群体活动的重要测量指标，但其响应调谐通常比尖峰调谐更弱更宽。因此需要优化调谐方法来准确评估LFP响应并与邻近的尖峰活动进行比较。

Method: 首先分析灵长类初级视觉皮层记录的亮度对比诱发LFP响应，使用单调性指数区分超饱和、线性和饱和对比响应函数，然后通过MLP神经网络、RBF神经网络、模糊模型、神经模糊模型和LOLIMOT算法等静态识别方法识别超饱和记录数据。

Result: 与传统和改进的双曲Naka-Rushton函数相比，MLP神经网络在调谐局部场电位对亮度对比刺激的响应方面表现出更优越的性能，成功调谐了所有三种类型的更多神经记录。

Conclusion: MLP神经网络模型可作为测量神经元群体对比敏感度调谐曲线的新方法，比其他现有模型能提供更好的拟合效果。

Abstract: Local field potentials (LFPs) have been demonstrated to be an important
measurement to study the activity of a local population of neurons. The
response tunings of LFPs have been mostly reported as weaker and broader than
spike tunings. Therefore, selecting optimized tuning methods is essential for
appropriately evaluating the LFP responses and comparing them with neighboring
spiking activity. In this paper, new models for tuning of the contrast response
functions (CRFs) are proposed. To this end, luminance contrast-evoked LFP
responses recorded in primate primary visual cortex (V1) are first analyzed.
Then, supersaturating CRFs are distinguished from linear and saturating CRFs by
using monotonicity index (MI). The supersaturated recording data are then
identified through static identification methods including multilayer
perceptron (MLP) neural network, radial basis function (RBF) neural network,
fuzzy model, neuro-fuzzy model, and the local linear model tree (LOLIMOT)
algorithm. Our results demonstrate that the MLP neural network, compared to
traditional and modified hyperbolic Naka-Rushton functions, exhibits superior
performance in tuning the local field potential responses to luminance contrast
stimuli, resulting in successful tuning of a significantly higher number of
neural recordings of all three types. These results suggest that the MLP neural
network model can be used as a novel approach to measure a better fitted
contrast sensitivity tuning curve of a population of neurons than other
currently used models.

*Chenxing Tan,Yuguan Hou,Hao Wang,Zhonghao Yuan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于微多普勒能量的77GHz FMCW雷达多目标生命体征监测框架，相比传统相位方法更抗噪声和运动干扰，能准确分离5米内4个目标的呼吸和心率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相位方法易受环境噪声、随机身体运动和严格校准要求影响，需要更鲁棒的生命体征监测方法。

Method: 集成空间-时间自适应处理(STAP)进行目标检测跟踪，MUSIC算法进行高分辨率角度估计，创新自适应频谱滤波技术提取生命体征，建立微多普勒能量变化与生理活动的数学关系。

Result: 系统能准确检测和分离5米内4个目标的生命体征，呼吸和心率平均绝对误差分别为1.2次/分钟和2.3次/分钟，在多目标场景下性能优于传统相位方法。

Conclusion: 微多普勒能量提取方法对相位噪声和运动伪影具有固有鲁棒性，在多目标生命体征监测中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel micro-Doppler energy-based framework for robust
multi-target vital signs monitoring using 77-GHz Frequency-Modulated
Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar. Unlike conventional phase-based methods that are
susceptible to environmental noise, random body movements, and stringent
calibration requirements, our approach exploits the energy variations in radar
returns induced by cardiopulmonary activities. The proposed system integrates a
comprehensive processing pipeline including space-time adaptive processing
(STAP) for target detection and tracking, MUSIC algorithm for high-resolution
angle estimation, and an innovative adaptive spectral filtering technique for
vital signs extraction. We establish a rigorous mathematical framework that
formalizes the relationship between micro-Doppler energy variations and
physiological activities, enabling robust separation of closely spaced targets.
The key innovation lies in the micro-Doppler energy extraction methodology that
provides inherent robustness to phase noise and motion artifacts. Experimental
results using millimeter-wave radar datasets demonstrate that the system can
accurately detect and separate vital signs of up to four targets within
\SI{5}{\meter} range, achieving mean absolute errors of \SI{1.2}beats per
minute and \SI{2.3} beats per minute for respiration and heart rates,
respectively. The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared
to traditional phase-based methods, particularly in challenging multi-target
scenarios with environmental noise and subject movement.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了ECG和ICG特征在生物识别中的作用，发现QRS相关的ECG特征对个体识别最为重要且对情绪变化具有鲁棒性，而ICG特征提供补充但稳定性较低的信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ECG和ICG特征在生物识别中的判别能力和对情绪变化的鲁棒性，以开发更可靠的基于心电图的身份识别系统。

Method: 使用随机森林模型结合多种可解释性方法（Gini重要性、置换重要性、SHAP值）评估29个ECG和ICG特征，并进行相关性分析、统计分析和特征选择（递归特征消除和遗传算法）。

Result: ECG特征特别是QRS相关描述符在重要性排名中最高，ICG特征提供补充信息但稳定性较低。特征选择将特征集从29个减少到14个，准确率仅下降1%（达到99%）。

Conclusion: 可靠的个体识别主要依赖于QRS相关的ECG特征，这些特征对情绪变化具有鲁棒性；ICG特征通过振幅提供支持性但稳定性较低的判别线索。

Abstract: This study investigates the role of electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance
cardiogram (ICG) features in biometric identification, emphasizing their
discriminative capacity and robustness to emotional variability. A total of 29
features spanning four domains (temporal, amplitude, slope, and morphological)
are evaluated using random forest (RF) models combined with multiple
interpretability methods. Feature importance shows that both ECG- and
ICG-derived features are consistently ranked among the top 10 by Gini
importance, permutation importance, and SHAP values, with ECG features,
particularly QRS-centric descriptors, occupying the highest positions. In
parallel, ICG BCX features contribute complementary, however, with lower
cross-method stability. Correlation analysis reveals substantial
multicollinearity, where the RF distributes and diminishes importance across
highly correlated pairs, confirming reduced independent contributions.
Statistical analysis identifies 14 features with significant differences
between baseline and anger, without a clear pattern by domain. Feature
selection with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms converges
on a subset (14 features) that attains accuracy within 1% of the full set
(99%), improving efficiency in storage and computation. These complementary
analyses indicate that the individuality required for reliable identification
is primarily encoded in QRS-related ECG features across all four domains.
Meanwhile, BCX-derived ICG features contribute mainly through amplitude,
providing supportive but less stable discriminatory cues. The confirmed
resilience of QRS-centric descriptors to emotional variation, where stable
inter-individual differences in the QRS complex could be traced to variations
in ventricular mass, conduction pathways, and thoracic geometry, may indicate
their central role in future models of cardiogram-based identity.

TL;DR: 提出一个3D优化框架，联合校准AI推理的准确性、成本和延迟，在统一决策空间内实现约束感知的推理扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的1D启发式方法和2D双变量权衡方法无法同时考虑成本和时间约束，需要更全面的优化框架。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛模拟在三个代表性场景和九个模拟大语言模型上评估四种优化方法，解决3D多目标优化问题。

Result: 膝点优化实现了最佳平衡，当精度优先时准确性最大化方法仍然有利。该框架为不同操作环境下的部署感知推理扩展奠定了理论基础。

Conclusion: 在MOO中构建推理扩展形成了1D和2D优化无法捕捉的可行空间，实现了环境自适应的推理扩展参数选择。

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在临床应用中受限于样本量不足，而现有的基础模型由于自监督学习与脑-结果关系不一致，对下游任务（如疾病预测）不够优化。

Method: 利用丰富的环境变量和人口统计数据，将脑建模构建为多任务学习，包括：(i)通过标记化脑-环境交互进行多任务预训练，(ii)使用预训练BEI的伪标签进行半监督微调。

Result: 在性别预测、人类行为识别以及自闭症、帕金森病、阿尔茨海默病和精神分裂症的早期诊断等多种应用中取得了有前景的结果。

Conclusion: 该基础模型在促进当前神经影像临床常规应用方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

### [19] [ADPO: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18913)
*Wang Zixian*

TL;DR: ADPO是一个统一框架，扩展了DPO，引入软偏好概率、任意参考策略锚定和列表式偏好建模，在噪声环境下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO假设硬二元标签和成对比较，存在梯度漂移问题。ADPO旨在通过软偏好编码不确定性，通过锚定稳定训练，并支持列表式偏好建模。

Method: ADPO引入：(1)软偏好概率减轻梯度漂移；(2)任意参考策略锚定通过组间平移不变性和隐式KL正则化稳定训练；(3)通过Plackett-Luce分布进行列表式偏好建模。

Result: 在上下文赌博机中，锚定使WinMass比标准DPO提升38-63%；KDE平滑在重尾噪声下达到0.68 vs 0.32（112%相对增益）。在顺序强化学习中，锚定在噪声偏好下性能提升15-29%。

Conclusion: ADPO为DPO提供了统一扩展框架，在噪声环境下表现优异。建议在清洁或中等噪声下使用成对锚定Soft-DPO，在极端污染下使用基于KDE的列表式ADPO。

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

Motivation: 随着LLM和机器学习在移动设备上的部署需求增长，需要专门针对Apple Silicon优化的框架来充分利用设备硬件能力。

Method: 创建MLX-transformers框架，在MLX中实现不同Transformer架构，将PyTorch模型转换为MLX格式，并在Apple Silicon MacBook和NVIDIA GPU上对比推理延迟。

Result: MLX在Apple Silicon设备上展现出高效的推理性能，为设备端ML应用提供了可行解决方案。

Conclusion: MLX框架在Apple生态系统中具有实现高效、可访问设备端机器学习应用的潜力。

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

Motivation: RLHF/RLVR方法对奖励噪声高度敏感，但噪声与基于群体的策略优化方法之间的相互作用研究不足。

Method: 引入GRPO和Dr.GRPO框架，将奖励噪声建模为伯努利噪声，通过估计奖励翻转概率进行噪声校正，获得理论上无偏的梯度估计。

Result: 在数学任务上准确率提升高达6.7个百分点，代码任务提升1.5个百分点，在真实奖励模型条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: 将监督学习中的标签噪声校正与现代RLHF相结合，为噪声现实部署提供了理论洞见和实用算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 提出的多尺度学习框架有效解决了复杂系统的建模挑战，在所有时间尺度上提供近似和解释，具有实际应用的适应性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

<details>

Motivation: 离线强化学习在提高样本效率的同时面临策略熵急剧下降、优化不稳定甚至崩溃的挑战，需要解决负优势样本主导梯度以及固定裁剪机制抑制探索的问题。

Method: 基于理论分析提出BAPO方法，动态调整裁剪边界以自适应地平衡正负贡献、保持熵值并稳定RL优化，适用于样本回放和部分回滚等离线场景。

Result: 在AIME 2024和2025基准测试中，7B BAPO模型超越SkyWork-OR1-7B等开源模型，32B BAPO模型在同等规模模型中达到最先进水平，甚至超过o3-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking等专有系统。

Conclusion: BAPO通过动态裁剪机制有效解决了离线强化学习中的优化不平衡问题，实现了快速、稳定且数据高效的训练，在大语言模型对齐和强化方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

### [24] [Position: Many generalization measures for deep learning are fragile](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18934)
*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文指出许多后验泛化度量（在训练好的神经网络上计算的度量）是脆弱的：微小的训练修改虽然几乎不影响DNN本身，但会显著改变度量的值、趋势或缩放行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习领域广泛使用各种泛化度量，虽然获得紧致边界仍然困难，但这些度量通常被认为能重现定性的泛化趋势。本文旨在揭示这些度量的脆弱性问题。

Method: 通过实验分析不同泛化度量对微小训练修改的敏感性，包括超参数调整（如学习率）、优化器变体切换等，观察这些变化如何影响度量值、趋势和缩放行为。

Result: 发现许多边界度量（如路径范数、谱范数、Frobenius范数、平坦度代理和确定性PAC-Bayes代理）都是脆弱的。例如，路径范数的学习曲线斜率会因微小超参数变化而反转。PAC-Bayes原点度量虽然对超参数调整不敏感，但无法捕捉数据复杂度的差异。

Conclusion: 后验泛化度量普遍存在脆弱性问题，新度量开发者应该明确审计其脆弱性。函数基边际似然PAC-Bayes边界能捕捉数据复杂度差异，但不是后验度量。

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

TL;DR: NeuroAda是一种新型参数高效微调方法，通过识别重要参数并引入旁路连接，在保持高内存效率的同时实现细粒度模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有参数高效微调方法在表示能力和内存效率之间的权衡问题：加法方法（如LoRA）内存效率高但表示能力有限，选择性方法适应效果好但内存消耗大。

Method: 首先识别网络中的重要参数（连接），然后为这些选定参数引入旁路连接。微调期间只更新旁路连接，保持原始模型参数冻结。

Result: 在23+个自然语言生成和理解任务上的实验表明，NeuroAda仅需≤0.02%的可训练参数即可达到最先进性能，同时将CUDA内存使用减少高达60%。

Conclusion: NeuroAda成功调和了细粒度适应和内存效率之间的权衡，为参数高效微调提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

Conclusion: 对抗性蒸馏框架有效解决了神经算子的分布外泛化问题，为实际应用提供了更可靠的PDE求解方案

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and
empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to
suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large
Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks
(CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to
provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach
utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured
datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient
data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast
patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates
prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by
effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of
existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that
our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000
rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes
cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational
effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine
adapted to specific patient characteristics.

Conclusion: 建立了类别学习与神经表示优化的理论联系，展示了最优学习如何使神经表示适应类别结构，并与信息瓶颈方法建立联系，提出了贝叶斯成本的偏差-方差分解。

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance
decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于值的算法仅限于离散动作空间，在连续动作空间中计算不可行；而actor-critic方法虽然流行但训练不稳定，需要学习额外的actor网络。

Method: 采用纯值函数框架，引入关键架构和算法选择，通过结构最大化Q函数实现高效学习，无需单独的actor网络。

Result: 在标准仿真任务中表现出与最先进基线相当的性能和样本效率，在约束动作空间中优于传统actor-critic方法。

Conclusion: 纯值函数方法在连续控制中是可行的，结构最大化Q函数能够提供稳定高效的学习，特别是在非平滑值函数环境中具有优势。

Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning
due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has
traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on
estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action
spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes
computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically
employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,
and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their
popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In
this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control
that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key
architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.
We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard
simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with
state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.
Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value
functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization
outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策树依赖简单的轴对齐线性分割，需要深层复杂结构来捕捉非线性特征效应，这削弱了模型的可解释性。

Method: 提出了SGT框架，每个内部节点对单个特征应用可学习的轴对齐形状函数；开发了ShapeCART算法来学习SGT；并扩展到双变量形状函数(S²GT)和多路树(SGT_K)。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SGT相比传统轴对齐线性树实现了更优的性能，同时模型规模更小。

Conclusion: SGT通过引入可学习的形状函数，在保持可解释性的同时实现了更好的性能和更紧凑的模型结构。

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

<details>

Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护了数据隐私，但其分布式特性容易受到后门攻击。现有的后门关键层选择方法基于规则，未考虑层间相互关系，导致效果不佳且容易被先进防御检测。

Method: 提出POLAR框架，采用强化学习动态学习攻击策略，使用伯努利采样优化层选择，基于后门成功率改进进行策略梯度更新，并通过正则化约束限制修改层数以保持隐蔽性。

Result: 在对抗六种最先进防御方法的实验中，POLAR比最新攻击方法的性能提升高达40%。

Conclusion: POLAR证明了强化学习在后门攻击层选择问题上的有效性，能够动态优化攻击策略，在保持隐蔽性的同时显著提升攻击成功率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LinUCB算法在推荐系统中训练、推理和内存成本随特征维度和动作空间大小增长，关键瓶颈是需要更新、求逆和存储包含交互历史上下文信息的设计矩阵。

Method: 采用动态低秩参数化逆Cholesky因子，推导数值稳定的秩1和批量更新方法，无需直接形成整个矩阵。使用投影器-分裂积分器控制内存增长。

Result: 实现了平均每步更新成本O(dr)和内存O(dr)，推理复杂度为O(dr)每动作评估，在推荐系统数据集上验证了算法有效性。

Conclusion: Scalable LinUCB算法通过低秩近似显著降低了计算和内存需求，为大规模推荐系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过大规模实证研究发现，muP学习率缩放规则仅在训练初期有效，而在实际LLM训练中，权重衰减才是稳定内部表示更新动态的关键因素，muP主要起到隐式学习率预热的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究muP参数化方法在学习率迁移中的实际作用，挑战现有关于学习率迁移的普遍认知，解释为什么muP需要独立权重衰减变体才能成功迁移。

Method: 进行大规模实证调查，分析muP假设在实际训练中的有效性，比较muP和权重衰减在不同训练阶段对内部表示更新动态的影响。

Result: 发现muP的假设仅在训练初期成立，而在大部分训练过程中，权重衰减才是稳定更新动态的关键；muP主要作为隐式学习率预热机制。

Conclusion: 这些发现从根本上挑战了关于学习率迁移的普遍信念，解释了为什么muP需要独立权重衰减，并表明可以通过修改预热计划来替代muP。

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统策略学习算法在预测不确定时仍强制决策，这在高风险场景中很危险。需要允许策略在不确定时弃权，转向安全默认选项或专家决策。

Method: 提出两阶段学习器：第一阶段识别近最优策略集合，第二阶段基于这些策略之间的分歧构建弃权规则。使用双重稳健目标处理未知倾向得分情况。

Result: 在已知倾向得分时获得O(1/n)型快速遗憾保证，并扩展到未知倾向得分情况。弃权机制还能提升边界条件下的性能保证，连接分布鲁棒策略学习，并支持安全策略改进。

Conclusion: 弃权是策略学习中的多功能工具，能在不确定时提供安全机制，改善性能保证，并支持分布鲁棒性和安全策略改进。

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

Result: 正向与反向课程学习的相对效果取决于模型能力和任务复杂度；同一指标内不同难度样本在不同任务中产生不同收益；任务对齐课程主要影响最终表示和泛化，而内部状态课程调节置信度和不确定性等内部状态。

Conclusion: 挑战了通用课程策略的概念，为不同模型和任务提供了可操作指导，某些指标表明优先处理决策不确定样本可以进一步改善学习效果。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

Motivation: 在关键应用中部署SGD需要严格量化其固有不确定性，现有高维推理方法计算成本高且维度扩展受限。

Method: 提出基于在线SGD的程序，开发在线方差估计器，并建立该估计器的高概率偏差界。

Result: SGD迭代在迭代次数增长为t ≳ d^(1+δ)时满足CLT，运行时间为O(td)，内存需求为O(d)，相比协方差逆方法的O(td² + d³)运行时间显著改进。

Conclusion: 这些结果为在接近最优缩放机制t ≳ d^(1+δ)下构建SGD迭代的置信区间提供了第一个完全在线和数据驱动的框架。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs用向量权重替代标量权重提高了表达能力，但导致参数和内存呈乘法增长，需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: 使用轻量级元学习器将低维嵌入映射到系数向量，通过K-means聚类将边向量替换为共享质心，最后微调质心码本恢复精度。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，MetaCluster实现了参数存储减少高达80倍，且精度无损失。

Conclusion: MetaCluster成功解决了KANs参数爆炸问题，为高效神经网络压缩提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

Motivation: 在社交网络中，同伴推荐的成功率高度依赖于上下文因素，准确估计这些影响力概率对于理解信息传播过程和改进病毒营销策略至关重要。然而，从数据中学习这些概率具有挑战性：静态数据只能捕捉相关性，而在线学习算法要么浪费资源进行随机探索，要么偏向于探索高影响力概率的空间。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了学习同伴影响力概率时存在的基本权衡，并提出了有效的算法来平衡这一权衡，为信息传播建模和病毒营销策略提供了理论支持和实践指导。

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

*Daniel Zhao,Daniel Beaglehole,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Julian McAuley,Zachary Novack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MusicRFM框架通过递归特征机器在预训练音乐模型中实现细粒度、可解释的控制，无需重新训练模型即可通过引导内部激活来操控音乐生成属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控音乐生成方法通常需要重新训练模型或会产生可听伪影，需要一种能够在不影响生成质量的前提下实现精细控制的方法。

Method: 训练轻量级RFM探针发现MusicGen隐藏状态中的概念方向，在推理时将这些方向注入回模型，通过动态时间变化调度和多属性同时执行机制实现实时控制。

Result: 将目标音符生成准确率从0.23提升到0.82，同时文本提示遵循度保持在未引导基线的0.02范围内，在控制效果和生成质量之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: MusicRFM提供了一种有效的可控音乐生成方法，能够在保持提示保真度的同时实现精确的音乐属性控制，为音乐领域的RFM应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Granger因果关系基于线性模型，难以检测非线性关系，且依赖因果充分性和已知干预目标两个关键假设。现实中存在潜在混淆变量和异质环境，使得难以区分干预环境。

Method: 提出不变Granger因果关系(InvarGC)，利用跨环境异质性减轻潜在混淆影响，以边级粒度区分干预与非干预环境，恢复不变因果关系。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有竞争优势。

Conclusion: 建立了在这些条件下的可识别性，提出的InvarGC方法能有效解决传统Granger因果关系分析的局限性。

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型越来越多地使用合成数据进行微调，存在微妙错位通过互联AI系统传播的关键风险。目前缺乏对这一现象的定量理解。

Method: 使用GPT-2构建师生设置，系统研究潜意识腐败的缩放规律、阈值和机制，包括行为交叉分析、相变检测和可解释性分析。

Result: 实验发现：(1)潜意识腐败导致行为交叉，降低模型整体对齐性；(2)对齐性在中毒数据临界阈值处发生急剧相变；(3)腐败机制模仿自然微调过程，难以检测。

Conclusion: 结果表明依赖合成数据的AI系统存在关键漏洞，需要能够考虑潜在威胁的新安全协议。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出两种特征空间微调方法LoRFA和VeFA，通过轻量级特征变换补偿下游潜伏变量的影响，在保持预训练知识的同时提升分布偏移下的模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型微调中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是当下游域数据有限或与预训练分布差异较大时，现有参数高效微调方法容易过度专业化而丢失预训练知识。

Method: 在特征空间而非权重空间进行微调，提出LoRFA（低秩特征适应）和VeFA（基于向量的特征适应），基于效应等价建模理论补偿下游潜伏变量的影响。

Result: 在图像分类、自然语言理解和生成任务上，特征空间适应方法达到与标准微调相当的性能，并在分布偏移下展现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 特征空间微调能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，保持预训练表示，在保持性能的同时显著提升模型对分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对线性部分监控问题的非随机对抗性方法，通过探索优化方法实现高效实现，获得了比先前理论更透明的遗憾界限，在易游戏中达到√T速率，在难游戏中达到T^{2/3}速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性部分监控可以建模无限结果空间，同时在线性结构和观测上施加线性结构，是线性赌博机问题的推广，其中损失和反馈以灵活方式解耦。

Method: 采用探索优化方法的简单实例，适用于高效实现，处理非随机对抗性有限动作版本的线性部分监控问题。

Conclusion: 该方法在包含在此模型中的新旧部分信息设置中实例化界限，并说明所实现的游戏结构依赖性在有趣情况下可能是紧的。

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

Motivation: 整合多样化数据对于改善科学探索至关重要，该研究旨在建立能够编码小鼠行为视频的模型，支持跨学科研究人员研究小鼠行为。

Method: 使用开源Qwen2.5-VL模型，通过提示工程、上下文学习和帧级预处理来增强性能，无需模型微调。

Result: 这些方法都改善了分类性能，组合使用时在所有行为类别上获得了强大的F1分数，包括罕见的冻结和逃跑行为。

Conclusion: 该模型将支持跨学科研究人员通过整合多个时间点和环境的行为特征，构建能够解决复杂研究问题的综合数据集。

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

TL;DR: 该论文对随机自然梯度变分推断(NGVI)在非共轭模型中的理论分析进行了改进，提出了相对平滑性条件，设计了改进的NGVI算法并证明了其收敛性，揭示了变分损失函数的隐藏凸性。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管NGVI在经验上很成功，但其在非共轭似然情况下的理论基础仍然有限，变分损失变得非凸且难以分析。

Method: 针对均值场参数化，推导了变分损失满足相对平滑性的充分条件，提出了包含非欧投影的改进NGVI算法，并在额外结构假设下分析了隐藏凸性。

Result: 证明了改进NGVI算法的全局非渐近收敛到驻点，在某些条件下建立了快速全局收敛到全局最优解的结果。

Conclusion: 这些结果为NGVI在具有挑战性的推断设置中的几何结构和收敛行为提供了新的理论见解。

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多任务后训练假设所有任务贡献相似大小的梯度，但研究发现RL后训练中某些任务会产生显著更大的梯度，导致优化偏差。

Method: 分析多任务后训练中不同任务的梯度大小和学习收益关系，研究梯度不平衡现象及其影响。

Result: 发现大梯度任务并不一定获得更大的学习收益，梯度不平衡不能通过训练奖励或优势等典型统计量解释，而是源于任务间的固有差异。

Conclusion: 警示不要简单混合数据集，需要开发基于梯度的校正方法来处理多任务后训练中的梯度不平衡问题。

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中通信受限的强化学习问题，降低通信开销同时维持智能体间的协调。

Method: 采用去中心化actor-critic框架，每个智能体在本地进行多步策略和价值函数更新（使用多层神经网络近似），然后与邻居交换信息。

Result: 在马尔可夫采样下建立了有限时间收敛分析：达到ε精度稳定点的样本复杂度为O(ε⁻³)，通信复杂度为O(ε⁻¹τ⁻¹)，其中τ为本地训练步数。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少通信负担的同时保持了协调性，数值实验验证了理论结果的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 将机器遗忘重新构建为多目标优化问题，并通过CUP算法实现了对遗忘过程的精确控制，解决了传统方法面临的权衡挑战。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster
than existing approaches.

*Yiyu Qian,Su Nguyen,Chao Chen,Qinyue Zhou,Liyuan Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SILVER with RL-guided labeling方法，通过将RL策略自身动作输出纳入边界点识别，将SILVER框架扩展到多动作和高维环境，显著提升了深度强化学习的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SILVER框架仅限于低维、二元动作领域，限制了深度强化学习策略的可解释性和可信度。需要开发能够处理高维、多动作环境的可解释性方法。

Method: 首先从图像观察中提取紧凑特征表示，进行SHAP特征归因，然后使用RL引导标记生成行为一致的边界数据集，最后训练决策树和回归函数等替代模型来解释RL策略的决策结构。

Result: 在两个Atari环境中使用三种深度RL算法进行评估，结果表明该方法在保持竞争性任务性能的同时，显著提高了透明度和人类对智能体行为的理解。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过将SILVER转化为可扩展且行为感知的框架，推进了可解释强化学习的发展，能够在高维多动作设置中解释深度RL智能体。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了GraMixC模块，通过提取配置、使用RMS技术对齐并融合，在多个任务中显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类具有通过相似性分组对象的能力，聚类算法试图模拟这种机制。配置（跨多个分辨率尺度的有效层次聚类）可以在无标签数据下发现，但选择和组合仍依赖于下游任务和输入

Method: 引入GraMixC模块：提取配置、使用反向合并/分裂(RMS)技术对齐、通过注意力头融合，然后传递给下游预测器

Result: 在DSN1 16S rRNA培养介质预测任务中，R2分数从0.6提升到0.9；在标准表格基准测试中持续优于单分辨率和静态特征基线

Conclusion: GraMixC能够有效提取和融合配置，在多个任务中实现最先进性能，证明了配置在表示学习中的有效性

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

TL;DR: 提出FnRGNN框架，用于图神经网络节点回归任务的公平性处理，通过结构、表示和预测三个层面的干预来减少群体差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在结构化数据学习方面表现出色，但回归任务中的公平性问题研究不足。现有方法主要针对分类任务和表示层面的去偏，无法完全处理节点级回归的连续性特征。

Method: FnRGNN框架在三个层面进行干预：(i)结构层面的边重加权，(ii)表示层面通过MMD进行对齐，(iii)预测层面通过Sinkhorn分布匹配进行归一化。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，FnRGNN能够在不牺牲性能的情况下减少群体差异。

Conclusion: 多层面策略确保了在复杂图拓扑下的鲁棒公平性，为图神经网络回归任务提供了有效的公平性解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet
fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly
target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully
address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a
fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that
applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,
(ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level
normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level
strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities
without sacrificing performance. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CAB框架，通过注意力桥接实现跨架构知识蒸馏，将Transformer教师模型的知识高效转移到状态空间学生模型中


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型虽然具有可扩展性优势，但训练成本高且生态系统不成熟，与Transformer的结构异质性使得知识蒸馏困难

Method: 使用轻量级注意力桥接实现token级监督，结合灵活的层间对齐策略来适应架构差异

Result: 在视觉和语言领域的广泛实验中，该方法显著提升了状态空间模型的性能，在有限训练数据下也表现优异

Conclusion: 基于注意力的知识可以高效转移到循环模型中，有助于快速利用Transformer专业知识构建更强的SSM社区

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through
recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem
around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the
structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to
efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work,
we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel
data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention
knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike
conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output
level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and
flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability.
We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate
architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments
across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently
improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training
data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.
Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently
transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer
expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为高斯蒸馏的新方法，通过深度潜在因子模型将教师集成压缩为学生分布，解决了知识蒸馏中不确定性保留不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度集成虽然能提供最先进的不确定性量化，但计算和内存需求大，难以部署到实际应用中。现有的知识蒸馏技术在压缩模型时会减少不确定性。

Method: 使用深度潜在因子模型将教师集成视为随机过程的实现，通过期望最大化算法稳定估计均值和协方差函数，将集成压缩为高斯分布。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，高斯蒸馏优于现有基线方法，并且在语言模型微调和分布偏移问题上表现良好。

Conclusion: 高斯蒸馏是一种有效的分布蒸馏方法，能够很好地保留集成的不确定性，同时显著减少计算和内存开销。

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在Verilog代码生成方面展现出潜力，但缺乏有意义的功能奖励阻碍了基于强化学习的偏好优化，难以生成功能正确的Verilog代码。

Method: 通过比较生成模块与参考模块的信号功能正确性，使用抽象语法树识别信号感知代码段，引入信号感知DPO在正确的信号级代码段上进行优化。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM基准测试中达到最先进性能，7B参数模型匹配DeepSeek v3 671B模型的性能，显著优于在同一数据集上训练的开源模型CodeV。

Conclusion: QiMeng-SALV标志着Verilog代码生成从传统模块级优化向细粒度信号级优化的范式转变，解决了功能奖励不足的问题。

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜在路径保留分布信息，解决离散扩散模型采样时的信息崩溃问题，显著提升文本生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在并行解码方面有优势，但采样时分类采样会导致丰富的分布信息崩溃为one-hot向量，无法在步骤间传播，限制了后续步骤的信息利用。

Method: 引入Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜在路径保留分布信息，采用自条件策略高效训练Loopholing离散扩散模型(LDDMs)。

Result: 生成困惑度相比基线降低高达61%，接近甚至超过自回归模型性能，生成文本更连贯，在Countdown和Game of 24等算术推理任务上表现更好。

Conclusion: Loopholing机制缓解了空闲步骤和振荡问题，为非自回归文本生成提供了可扩展的高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Conclusion: 多模态学习和数据预处理技术（如平衡和插补）在数据稀疏或不完整情况下能够显著改善预测生态建模，有助于实现更精确和可扩展的生物多样性监测。

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk
assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both
discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less
attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical
predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an
ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and
metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used
calibration methods.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）的预测形式对实际应用价值的影响，指出虽然这些模型在预测精度上表现良好，但预测形式（点预测、分位数预测、参数预测或轨迹集成）决定了其支持的操作任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型主要关注预测精度，但忽略了预测形式对实际应用任务的关键限制。许多操作任务需要轨迹集成预测来保持时间依赖性，而现有模型大多只提供点预测或参数预测。

Method: 通过调查近期TSFMs，分析不同预测类型之间的可转换性，证明边际分布无法确定路径依赖事件概率，并将六种基本预测任务映射到最小充分预测类型。

Result: 研究发现三分之二的TSFMs只产生点预测或参数预测，而许多操作任务需要轨迹集成预测。轨迹集成可以简化为更简单的形式，但反向转换需要额外假设。

Conclusion: 预测类型而非精度决定了实际效用，需要任务对齐的评估框架来确保预测形式与操作需求匹配。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

Motivation: 传统对抗样本是在原始样本附近添加微小扰动导致模型误分类，而本文探索相反的情况：生成与原始样本显著不同但仍被模型正确分类的样本，以揭示模型决策边界的更完整特性。

Method: 提出了负迭代快速梯度符号方法(NI-FGSM)、负迭代快速梯度方法(NI-FGM)及其动量变体(NMI-FGSM、NMI-FGM)，这些算法通过迭代优化生成与原始样本差异最大化但保持相同分类结果的对抗样本。

Result: 实验表明此类对抗样本广泛分布在样本空间中，而不仅仅局限于原始样本的邻域，这揭示了模型决策边界的更复杂特性，且这些样本可用于特定场景下的攻击。

Conclusion: 对抗样本不仅存在于原始样本的局部邻域，而是广泛分布于整个样本空间，这为理解机器学习模型的鲁棒性和安全性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which
poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by
applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the
dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original
example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite
manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result
in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such
adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign
method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM),
along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods
could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain
occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not
merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset;
instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种从多变量时间序列中提取系统"年龄"代理特征的方法，通过优化公式的单调性来发现潜在特征，能够将单调性较低的单传感器组合成高单调性的代理特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多系统会随时间老化或退化，但传感器数据中可能没有直接的"年龄"信息。需要从多变量时间序列中发现能够代表系统"年龄"的潜在代理特征。

Method: 使用精心定义的语法生成候选公式，通过优化公式的单调性（定义为时间和候选公式之间的绝对Spearman秩相关系数）来评估和选择最佳特征。

Result: 在人工生成数据集和两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够将单调性较低的单传感器（Spearman's ρ值分别为0.13和0.09）组合成高单调性的代理特征（Spearman's ρ值达0.95）。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够发现可解释的方程，这些方程可以作为系统"年龄"的有效代理特征，在结构健康监测等应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAligner是一个动态的、质量感知的图文本对齐框架，能够根据监督质量在表达性的多对多和保守的一对一目标之间动态调整，解决了现有图文本对齐方法在噪声监督下的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP风格图文本对齐器存在两个关键限制：假设节点和文本之间存在严格的一对一对应关系，忽略了现实世界图中固有的多对多关系；依赖于静态对齐目标，无法适应不同的数据质量，在噪声监督下变得脆弱。

Method: ADAligner通过实时估计批次级别的对齐可靠性并相应调整优化策略，在监督干净时促进软性的、子图级别的多对多对齐，在噪声情况下通过动态过滤低置信度对来强调可靠的一对一对齐。

Result: 在九个不同的TAG数据集上的综合实验表明，ADAligner在零样本/少样本节点分类、链接预测和跨模态检索任务上始终优于先前的图文本对齐器。在噪声监督下保持强大的鲁棒性，并且与多模态基线相比，预训练速度提高了约2到3倍。

Conclusion: ADAligner为现实世界网络环境中的图文本表示学习建立了一个可扩展且可靠的基础，通过动态质量感知机制解决了图文本对齐中的核心困境。

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CPSVD方法，通过智能分割参数矩阵，直接保留高分解误差的列，仅对低分解误差的列应用SVD，并自适应分配非均匀压缩率，显著提升LLM压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD方法将整个参数矩阵统一处理，忽略了不同矩阵部分SVD近似误差的显著差异，导致压缩效果不理想。

Method: CPSVD方法识别并直接保留高分解误差的矩阵列，仅对低分解误差的列应用SVD，精确确定两种策略的最佳平衡点，并自适应分配非均匀压缩率。

Result: 实验表明CPSVD在零样本任务上持续优于最先进的SVD压缩方法，实现更低的困惑度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: CPSVD通过智能矩阵分割和自适应压缩率分配，有效解决了传统SVD方法的局限性，显著提升了LLM压缩性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应秩分配(ARA)方法，用于解决大语言模型SVD压缩中的秩分配问题，通过专用掩码设计和额外损失函数实现全局最优解，在LLaMA2-7B模型上取得了最先进的压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法存在局限性：启发式算法搜索空间受限，基于掩码的训练难以有效捕捉奇异值谱与可训练参数的关系，且忽略了增益函数在压缩比为1时的非光滑特性，导致训练陷入局部最优。

Method: ARA方法包含：(1)专用掩码设计，实现保留秩与可训练参数之间的高效映射和更新；(2)额外损失函数，引导参数选择朝向全局最优解。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B模型80%压缩比下，ARA将WikiText2的困惑度从8.38降至6.42，零样本任务平均准确率相比均匀压缩提升了9.72个百分点。

Conclusion: ARA方法在SVD基LLM压缩中有效解决了秩分配问题，实现了最先进的压缩性能。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在物理信息神经网络训练中倾向于先学习低频特征的频谱偏差问题。

Method: 使用随机傅里叶特征增强隐空间，创建两阶段训练：估计特征空间基函数和执行增强基函数系数的回归。

Result: 在线性模型下证明训练方案收敛，经验表明随机傅里叶特征增强网络表达能力，在经典基准问题上表现出优于现有算法的性能。

Conclusion: IFeF-PINN通过傅里叶特征增强有效克服频谱偏差，显著提高高频率PDE的逼近精度。

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the
improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

Motivation: 现有去偏方法通常牺牲模型性能、依赖静态校正策略、难以处理数据稀疏性，且对敏感属性的利用不充分。

Method: 集成偏置检测器和条件低秩适应(LoRA)，仅对检测为有偏的实例激活公平校正机制，并使用新的对比损失函数减少跨敏感群体的类内表示差异。

Result: 理论分析和多基准测试验证FairNet能在不降低整体性能的情况下提升最差群体表现，甚至带来轻微性能提升。

Conclusion: FairNet提供了一种灵活处理不同敏感属性标签情况的动态公平校正方案，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

Motivation: 现有遗忘方法依赖梯度上升来降低特定目标响应的概率，但会导致概率质量重新分配到高似然区域（语义相关的重述），产生虚假遗忘问题。

Method: 提出引导框架，将挤压效应与模型自身高置信度生成（模型信念）联系起来，通过联合抑制目标响应和模型信念来实现更彻底的遗忘。包括BS-T（抑制高概率token）和BS-S（移除高置信度生成序列）两种方法。

Conclusion: 通过对抗概率挤压效应，提出的引导框架能够更有效地实现语言模型的遗忘，解决了现有方法导致的虚假遗忘问题。

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

Result: 在1D随机回归、图像修复和分类等少样本学习任务中，NVDPs表现出优异性能。

Conclusion: NVDPs能够稳健地近似任务特定dropout率，处理广泛的功能模糊性和不确定性，在少样本学习中表现卓越。

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

Motivation: 验证对抗鲁棒模型是否具有普适性，即在不同数据集和设置下是否表现出高度相似的表示和预测行为。

Method: 在不同数据集上测试对抗鲁棒模型的表示相似性和预测行为，分析分类层的影响，并通过重新训练分类器来改善预测普适性。

Result: 表示相似性在特定设置下成立，但预测行为不收敛；差异主要来自分类层；重新训练分类器可提高预测普适性。

Conclusion: 神经网络在特定设置下具有部分普适性，但不支持严格普适性概念；预测行为的差异可通过简单方法缓解。

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict
universality.

Motivation: 标准DPO方法面临可扩展性瓶颈：可能的训练对数量随标记序列数量呈二次方增长，导致即使中等规模数据集的训练时间也难以承受。

Method: g-DPO框架采用：(i) 序列空间聚类来修剪冗余训练对同时保留训练信号；(ii) 基于分组的近似方法来分摊似然计算。

Result: 在三个蛋白质工程任务中，g-DPO在保持与标准DPO统计上无法区分的硅内和体外性能的同时，收敛速度提高了1.8到3.7倍，且随着数据集规模增大，增益预期会更大。

Conclusion: g-DPO是解决DPO可扩展性问题的有效框架，能够在保持性能的同时显著加速训练过程。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

Conclusion: ELUTQ框架有效解决了边缘设备上LLM部署的内存和延迟瓶颈，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

TL;DR: SpikeQuant是一种基于脉冲神经网络的混合精度量化方法，通过将激活值重新编码为二进制脉冲计数，实现动态混合存储，并将量化尺度嵌入IF机制阈值，避免显式反量化操作，显著降低LLM部署的能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 选择性对具有显著值的激活应用混合精度量化，将其重新编码为二进制脉冲计数，实现动态混合存储。将量化尺度嵌入IF机制阈值，在权重和激活上执行节能的线性变换，避免显式反量化。

Conclusion: SpikeQuant为准确且节能的LLM部署提供了有效解决方案，结合了脉冲神经网络的优势与传统量化技术。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于一致性的幻觉检测方法主要依赖单个LLM生成多个响应，但受限于训练数据的不完善性（如偏见、信息不足等），需要进一步提升检测和缓解能力。

Method: 扩展单模型一致性方法，将来自15个不同LLM的响应进行组合，形成联盟一致性方法，探索不同模型组合的条件和效果。

Result: 多模型一致性方法在幻觉检测和缓解方面取得显著改进，性能优于单模型一致性方法，同时推理成本降低。

Conclusion: 通过整合多个不同LLM的响应，联盟一致性方法能有效提升幻觉检测和缓解能力，并克服单模型方法的高推理成本问题。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

Motivation: 解决时间序列解释性AI中的挑战，特别是在医疗领域如ECG分类中，需要可操作和可解释的洞察。

Method: 使用SHAP阈值识别关键信号段并转换为区间规则，利用DTW和聚类提取代表性原型，通过R峰对齐确保与样本的一致性。

Result: 生成的解释仅修改原始信号的78%，在所有类别中保持81.3%的有效性，时间稳定性提高43%，心肌梗死类别的有效性达98.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI诊断系统建立了生理感知的反事实解释设计原则，并为临床部署的用户控制解释界面奠定了基础。

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出Bi-level Decision-Focused Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL)方法，解决在线平台营销中的预测-决策错位和偏差-方差困境问题，通过双层优化框架联合利用观测和实验数据，已在美团大规模部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统两阶段方法存在预测-决策错位问题：机器学习只关注预测精度而不考虑下游优化目标，且观测数据存在多种偏差，实验数据虽无偏但稀缺昂贵，导致高方差估计。

Method: 开发基于实验数据的无偏OR决策质量估计器，通过代理损失函数连接离散优化梯度；建立双层优化框架，通过隐式微分联合利用观测和实验数据，实现最优偏差-方差权衡。

Result: 在公共基准、工业营销数据集和大规模在线A/B测试中验证了Bi-DFCL的有效性，相比最先进方法取得统计显著改进，已在美团平台部署。

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL系统性地解决了营销资源分配中的核心挑战，通过决策导向的因果学习方法实现了预测与优化的有效对齐，为在线平台提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

<details>

Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化方法存在显著的单步偏差，容易收敛到局部最优解，在复杂或高维任务中表现不佳

Method: 集成高斯过程进行局部指导，使用能量模型捕捉全局结构信息，将每次BO迭代定义为马尔可夫决策过程，采用PPO进行自适应多步前瞻

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中表现出优越性能，在不同GP配置下展现出适应性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: REBMBO方法有效克服了传统BO方法的局限性，在复杂优化任务中表现优异

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

Conclusion: MED-LQ成功将混淆实例原则和最小经验散度算法扩展到线性系统控制，为大规模马尔可夫决策过程的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

Motivation: AI方法在药物发现中应用日益广泛，但由于依赖公共数据集，缺乏制药专有数据的规模和多样性，限制了工业应用。联邦学习可以整合私有数据进行隐私保护的协作训练，但联邦数据访问使数据多样性评估、数据分割等任务变得复杂。

Method: 在八个不同分子数据集上，对三种联邦聚类方法（Fed-kMeans、Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans、Fed-LSH）与其集中式对应方法进行基准测试，使用标准数学指标和本文提出的化学指标SF-ICF进行评估。

Result: 大规模基准测试结合深入的可解释性分析表明，通过化学指标和客户端可解释性分析来融入领域知识对于分子数据的联邦多样性分析至关重要。

Conclusion: 联邦聚类方法能够有效地解构和表示分布式分子数据，但需要结合领域知识和化学特定指标来获得有意义的分析结果。

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

Motivation: 机器学习在传染病爆发预测中应用广泛，但针对地方性疾病的预测研究不足，特别是RSV等疾病的长期预测。

Method: 结合XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM的集成模型，融合高分辨率特征学习和长程时间依赖捕捉机制，加入自回归模块处理气候控制的滞后关系，使用随机推理返回概率区间。

Result: 在美国34个州的评估中，ForecastNet-XCL在州内和跨州场景下均可靠地优于统计基线、单个神经网络和传统集成方法，在长时间预测范围内保持准确性。

Conclusion: ForecastNet-XCL的效率、性能和不确定性感知设计使其成为在气候压力加剧和监测资源受限情况下的可部署预警工具。

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

TL;DR: DiffEvac是一种基于生成模型的新方法，通过学习建筑疏散模式实现高效的疏散模拟，相比传统方法建模负担更低、速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疏散模拟依赖精细建模和大量参数，难以在早期设计阶段进行快速迭代。需要一种更高效的疏散模拟方法。

Method: 建立包含399个不同功能布局和对应疏散热力图的数据集，提出解耦特征表示方法嵌入物理特征，基于图像提示的扩散模型学习疏散模式。

Result: 相比使用条件GAN和RGB表示的方法，DiffEvac在SSIM上提升37.6%，PSNR提升142%，速度快16倍，模拟时间缩短至2分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了快速设计迭代效率，为智能建筑设计中的安全优化提供了新见解和技术路径，降低了建模负担，支持大规模假设探索。

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发可微分线性代数工具并将其广泛应用于机器学习实践的重要进展。

Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant
unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a
tool for fitting linear models. To release its potential, we derive custom
gradients that transform the solver into a differentiable operator, like a
neural network layer, enabling many diverse applications. Empirically, we
demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them
widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

Motivation: 现有LoRA变体缺乏明确区分任务相关信息与残差信息的机制，可能限制下游性能。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习两个独立的潜在空间，通过新的证据下界公式促进潜在空间之间的因子分解，一个空间专门处理任务显著特征，另一个处理残差信息。

Result: 在文本、音频和图像任务上的广泛实验表明，FVAE-LoRA持续优于标准LoRA。虚假相关性评估证实FVAE-LoRA能更好地隔离任务相关信号，在分布偏移下具有更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA通过显式分离任务相关特征和残差信息，有效提升了LoRA方法的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的重叠加权正交元学习器，用于在时间变化设置中估计异质处理效应，解决了现有方法在处理序列重叠度低时的方差爆炸问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间变化设置中估计异质处理效应面临严重挑战，因为观察某些治疗序列的概率随预测时间范围呈指数下降，导致数据支持不足和重叠问题。现有元学习器假设治疗重叠充分，在重叠度低时会出现估计方差爆炸。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的重叠加权正交元学习器，通过针对观察数据中接受干预治疗序列概率高的区域，提供完全数据驱动的方法来抵消现有元学习器的不稳定性。该方法使用Neyman-正交总体风险函数来最小化重叠加权的oracle风险。

Result: 通过使用transformer和LSTM骨干网络的广泛实验，证明了新WO学习器的优势。该学习器具有Neyman-正交性，对干扰函数错误设定具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的WO学习器能够有效解决时间变化设置中异质处理效应估计的重叠问题，获得更可靠的HTE估计，并且完全模型无关，可应用于任何机器学习模型。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance

Result: HSD相比最佳单草稿基线可实现高达1.2倍的加速，证明了该算法在减少生成延迟方面的实用性。

Conclusion: 分层推测解码通过利用多个草稿模型的层次结构，有效降低了Transformer语言模型的推理延迟，超越了以往的技术。

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

*Hui He,Kun Yi,Yuanchi Ma,Qi Zhang,Zhendong Niu,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEMPO是一个轻量级时间序列基础模型，通过能量感知频谱分解和混合提示Transformer，在减少预训练数据量和模型规模的同时，实现了强大的零样本和少样本预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型需要大规模预训练数据和庞大网络架构，难以在资源受限环境中部署。为了解决通用性与可负担性之间的矛盾，需要开发轻量级但性能强大的基础模型。

Method: 1) 能量感知频谱分解模块：同时建模高能量和低能量频率信号，提高预训练数据利用率；2) 混合提示Transformer：通过数据集特定提示学习异构时序模式，自适应路由时间序列token到基于提示的专家模块，实现参数高效适配。

Result: 在两个大规模基准测试（涵盖16个数据集）上的实验表明，SEMPO在零样本和少样本预测场景中均优于现有最先进方法，同时显著减少了预训练数据规模和模型大小。

Conclusion: SEMPO成功解决了时间序列基础模型在资源受限环境中的部署问题，在保持强大泛化能力的同时显著降低了计算和存储需求，为轻量级时间序列预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available
at https://github.com/mala-lab/SEMPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Enhanced TimeAutoDiff框架，利用合成ICU时间序列数据进行模型训练和评估，显著减少了真实数据与合成数据评估之间的差距，在细粒度人口亚组中提升了模型评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在重症监护领域使用合成数据进行模型评估时的可信度问题，特别是在细粒度人口亚组中的评估准确性，同时保护患者隐私数据。

Method: 基于先前的扩散和VAE生成器（TimeDiff、HealthGen、TimeAutoDiff），引入Enhanced TimeAutoDiff，在潜在扩散目标中增加了分布对齐惩罚项。

Result: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff将真实数据与合成数据评估之间的差距减少了70%以上，达到ΔTRTS ≤ 0.014 AUROC，同时保持训练效用（ΔTSTR ≈ 0.01）。在32个交叉亚组中，大型合成队列将亚组级AUROC估计误差减少了50%，并在72-84%的亚组中优于小型真实测试集。

Conclusion: 该工作为重症监护领域提供了实用、保护隐私的可信模型评估路线图，能够在不同患者群体中进行稳健可靠的性能分析，而无需暴露敏感的电子健康记录数据，有助于提升医疗AI的整体可信度。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

Motivation: 传统深度学习物种分布模型受限于空间数据偏差，在数据稀缺区域效果不佳，需要更好处理不确定性的方法。

Method: 引入BATIS框架，采用贝叶斯深度学习，结合先验预测和有限观测数据迭代更新，同时捕捉随机不确定性和认知不确定性。

Result: 在包含eBird公民科学观测的新数据集上测试，贝叶斯深度学习方法在数据稀缺位置显著提高了物种分布模型的可靠性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯深度学习能够有效结合局部生态洞察和广泛生态模式，为生态理解和保护工作提供更可靠的物种分布预测。

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了Transformer在算法学习中的局限性，通过图连通性问题揭示了模型倾向于学习简单启发式而非通用算法的现象，并提出了模型容量与训练数据匹配的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型经常无法学习通用算法，而是依赖脆弱的启发式方法。本文旨在从理论和实证角度解释这一现象，特别以图连通性问题作为测试平台。

Method: 使用简化的Transformer架构——解耦Transformer，理论证明L层模型能够解决直径不超过3^L的图问题，实现等同于计算邻接矩阵幂次的算法。分析训练动态，研究训练实例是否在模型容量范围内对学习策略的影响。

Result: 研究发现：在模型容量范围内的图（直径≤3^L）驱动模型学习正确的算法解，而超出容量的图则导致模型学习基于节点度的简单启发式。实证表明，限制训练数据在模型容量内能使标准和解耦Transformer都学习精确算法而非度基启发式。

Conclusion: Transformer学习算法的能力高度依赖于训练数据是否在模型的理论容量范围内。当数据超出容量时，模型会退化为学习简单启发式；而适当限制数据范围可促进算法学习，这对设计更好的算法学习系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

TL;DR: CONFEX是一种基于共形预测和混合整数线性规划的新方法，用于生成具有不确定性感知的反事实解释，提供局部覆盖保证和最优性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的反事实解释方法往往忽视预测不确定性，或者缺乏将不确定性纳入解释的正式机制，导致解释可能具有误导性或不适用。

Method: 使用共形预测和混合整数线性规划，通过离线树基输入空间划分开发局部化CP程序，实现高效的MILP编码。

Result: 在多个基准测试和指标上评估表明，CONFEX相比现有方法能产生更鲁棒和合理的解释。

Conclusion: CONFEX方法能够生成具有严格不确定性保证和最优性保证的反事实解释，解决了CFX生成违反可交换性的问题。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

Motivation: 现有最先进的成员推理攻击需要训练大量计算昂贵的参考模型，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 利用训练后损失分布的变化特性，通过高损失区域异常值的缺失来预测模型脆弱性，使用简单的损失攻击的真负率作为评估指标。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估模型隐私风险提供了高效实用的解决方案，在大型语言模型风险评估方面也显示出潜力。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

Motivation: 稀疏微调技术的有效性取决于最优选择要微调的模型参数，现有方法在参数选择上仍有改进空间。

Method: 提出GaLLoP方法，仅微调在下游任务中梯度幅度最大且预训练幅度最小的参数，优先选择任务相关度高但对预训练知识破坏小的参数。

Result: 在LLaMA3 8B和Gemma 2B上的实验表明，GaLLoP在分布内和分布外性能上均优于或匹配其他参数高效微调技术（如LoRA、DoRA、SAFT），并能减轻灾难性遗忘和任务数据记忆问题。

Conclusion: GaLLoP通过选择性地微调关键参数，实现了稳定且鲁棒的泛化性能，在大多数随机种子下都能保持一致的性能表现。

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

Motivation: 数据驱动方法依赖IID数据假设，现有泛化技术需要环境标签，但实际中环境标签往往难以获取，这限制了方法的应用。

Method: 通过分析固定神经网络在每轮训练中的预测误差来推断环境规范，直接从数据中实现环境分配，解决了无标签场景下的交替优化问题。

Result: 在多种动态系统上的实验表明，DynaInfer优于现有环境分配技术，能快速收敛到真实标签，甚至在环境标签可用时也能达到更优性能。

Conclusion: DynaInfer提供了一种有效的无环境标签推断方法，解决了数据获取挑战和隐私问题，在动态系统分析中表现出色。

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

Motivation: 解决如何证明Bob使用了Alice的开源模型的问题，即使Bob使用的是黑盒衍生模型。

Method: 将问题建模为独立性测试，利用语言模型中的记忆特性，通过测试Bob模型或文本与Alice训练数据顺序的关联性来检测模型使用。在查询设置中直接估计Bob模型对Alice训练数据的似然；在观察设置中通过文本重叠或重新训练模型来检测。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效检测模型衍生使用，为模型版权保护提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer是否能够作为元学习器，仅使用少量上下文示例适应新任务，而无需额外训练。现有理论分析大多未涉及正式的元学习设置。

Method: 使用简化Transformer架构，通过梯度下降训练，在线性分类设置中分析其元学习能力。考虑任务族，每个任务对应类条件高斯混合模型，均值向量位于共享的k维子空间。

Result: 训练足够多任务后，Transformer仅需O(k/R^4)个上下文示例就能泛化到新任务，性能几乎匹配知道共享子空间的最优学习器，显著优于仅访问上下文数据的学习器。

Conclusion: Transformer可以作为有效的元学习器，在知道任务结构的情况下，仅需少量上下文示例就能快速适应新任务，且训练任务和示例数量与维度d无关。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练的计算需求加剧了全球南方国家与高容量司法管辖区之间的结构性不对称，需要研究在硬件、能源和财政约束下的主权规模AI能力建设。

Method: 采用双轴设计，变化加速器类型（NVIDIA H100 vs A100）和训练时长（90天 vs 150天），评估计算需求、能耗、资本支出和监管兼容性。

Result: 所有配置均低于出口管制和电力基础设施阈值，但财政可行性取决于硬件效率。H100方案更具成本效益，A100因能耗和硬件需求更高而成本翻倍。

Conclusion: 延长训练时间应作为缓解硬件约束的政策杠杆，使中等收入国家能够建立可持续且战略充分的AI能力，生产可用、可审计且本地对齐的模型。

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

Result: 语义世界模型在开放机器人任务中实现了策略改进，相比基于重建的动作条件世界模型范式，显著提升了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 语义世界模型通过专注于任务相关语义信息而非像素重建，为机器人规划提供了更有效的世界建模方法，并继承了视觉语言模型的泛化优势。

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at

### [110] [Calibrated Principal Component Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19020)
*Yixuan Florence Wu,Yilun Zhu,Lei Cao and,Naichen Shi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了校准主成分回归(CPCR)方法，通过结合主成分子空间中的低方差先验学习和原始特征空间中的中心化Tikhonov校准，在过参数化广义线性模型中改善预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准主成分回归(PCR)在过参数化情况下通过投影到低维主成分子空间来减少方差，但当真实回归向量在保留主成分之外有质量时会产生截断偏差。需要一种方法来缓解这种偏差。

Method: CPCR首先在主成分子空间中学习低方差先验，然后通过中心化Tikhonov步骤在原始特征空间中对模型进行校准，利用交叉拟合并软化PCR的硬截断。

Result: 理论分析显示在随机矩阵机制下，当回归信号在低方差方向有不可忽略分量时，CPCR优于标准PCR。实证结果表明CPCR在多个过参数化问题中持续改善预测性能。

Conclusion: CPCR在过参数化设置中展现出稳定性和灵活性，能够有效控制截断偏差并提升预测性能。

Abstract: We propose a new method for statistical inference in generalized linear
models. In the overparameterized regime, Principal Component Regression (PCR)
reduces variance by projecting high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional
principal subspace before fitting. However, PCR incurs truncation bias whenever
the true regression vector has mass outside the retained principal components
(PC). To mitigate the bias, we propose Calibrated Principal Component
Regression (CPCR), which first learns a low-variance prior in the PC subspace
and then calibrates the model in the original feature space via a centered
Tikhonov step. CPCR leverages cross-fitting and controls the truncation bias by
softening PCR's hard cutoff. Theoretically, we calculate the out-of-sample risk
in the random matrix regime, which shows that CPCR outperforms standard PCR
when the regression signal has non-negligible components in low-variance
directions. Empirically, CPCR consistently improves prediction across multiple
overparameterized problems. The results highlight CPCR's stability and
flexibility in modern overparameterized settings.

### [111] [Signature Kernel Scoring Rule as Spatio-Temporal Diagnostic for Probabilistic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19110)
*Archer Dodson,Ritabrata Dutta*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了基于粗糙路径理论的签名核评分规则，用于评估和训练数据驱动的天气预报模型，能够更好地捕捉时空依赖性，在WeatherBench 2上验证了其高判别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评分规则如MSE忽略了天气数据的高度相关结构，需要新的评分方法来处理时空依赖性。

Method: 使用签名核评分规则，将天气变量重新定义为连续路径，通过迭代积分编码时空依赖性；使用路径增强保证唯一性；在ERA5再分析数据上训练滑动窗口生成神经网络。

Result: 签名核评分规则在WeatherBench 2模型上表现出高判别能力；基于签名核的训练在15个时间步的预测路径上优于气候学基准。

Conclusion: 签名核评分规则为天气预报提供了理论鲁棒的验证和训练指标，能够有效捕捉路径依赖性交互。

Abstract: Modern weather forecasting has increasingly transitioned from numerical
weather prediction (NWP) to data-driven machine learning forecasting
techniques. While these new models produce probabilistic forecasts to quantify
uncertainty, their training and evaluation may remain hindered by conventional
scoring rules, primarily MSE, which ignore the highly correlated data
structures present in weather and atmospheric systems. This work introduces the
signature kernel scoring rule, grounded in rough path theory, which reframes
weather variables as continuous paths to encode temporal and spatial
dependencies through iterated integrals. Validated as strictly proper through
the use of path augmentations to guarantee uniqueness, the signature kernel
provides a theoretically robust metric for forecast verification and model
training. Empirical evaluations through weather scorecards on WeatherBench 2
models demonstrate the signature kernel scoring rule's high discriminative
power and unique capacity to capture path-dependent interactions. Following
previous demonstration of successful adversarial-free probabilistic training,
we train sliding window generative neural networks using a
predictive-sequential scoring rule on ERA5 reanalysis weather data. Using a
lightweight model, we demonstrate that signature kernel based training
outperforms climatology for forecast paths of up to fifteen timesteps.

### [112] [Extreme Event Aware ($η$-) Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19161)
*Kai Chang,Themistoklis P. Sapsis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为η-learning的新方法，用于在训练数据中缺乏极端事件的情况下预测罕见极端事件，通过统计正则化减少极端事件区域的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化预测罕见极端事件对理解复杂动力系统至关重要，但现有方法通常假设训练数据中存在多个极端事件，导致在极端事件区域存在高认知不确定性。

Method: 引入η-learning方法，通过在训练过程中强制实施指示极端性的可观测量的统计特性，即使训练数据中缺乏极端事件，也能减少极端事件区域的不确定性。

Result: 理论分析基于最优传输理论证明了方法的优越性，数值实验在多个原型问题和实际降水降尺度问题上展示了η-learning框架的良好性能。

Conclusion: η-learning能够在不假设训练数据存在极端事件的情况下，生成前所未有的极端事件，为罕见极端事件预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Quantifying and predicting rare and extreme events persists as a crucial yet
challenging task in understanding complex dynamical systems. Many practical
challenges arise from the infrequency and severity of these events, including
the considerable variance of simple sampling methods and the substantial
computational cost of high-fidelity numerical simulations. Numerous data-driven
methods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a
typical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of
multiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the
sampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events
but with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or
$\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the
available data. $\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted'
extreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an
observable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available
through qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data. This type of
statistical regularization results in models that fit the observed data, while
enforcing consistency with the prescribed observable statistics, enabling the
generation of unprecedented extreme events even when the training data lack
extremes therein. Theoretical results based on optimal transport offer a
rigorous justification and highlight the optimality of the introduced method.
Additionally, extensive numerical experiments illustrate the favorable
properties of the $\eta$-learning framework on several prototype problems and
real-world precipitation downscaling problems.

*Pattravadee de Favereau de Jeneret,Ioannis Diamantis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 使用拓扑数据分析(TDA)特征进行聚类比传统统计特征能产生更紧凑和分离的货币行为聚类，特别是在外汇市场中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 外汇市场是一个复杂的系统，常表现出非线性和高维动态，传统统计方法可能无法完全捕捉这些特征。

Method: 比较基于TDA特征和传统统计特征的聚类结果，使用13种主要货币兑欧元的月度对数收益率，应用k均值和层次聚类算法，并通过轮廓系数和Calinski-Harabasz指数评估聚类质量。

Result: TDA特征聚类产生更紧凑和分离的聚类，Calinski-Harabasz得分显著更高，但所有方法的轮廓系数都较低，表明外汇时间序列聚类的固有难度。

Conclusion: TDA是分析金融时间序列的有价值补充工具，特别在风险管理中理解结构性共同变动方面具有应用潜力。

Abstract: This study investigates whether Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can provide
additional insights beyond traditional statistical methods in clustering
currency behaviours. We focus on the foreign exchange (FX) market, which is a
complex system often exhibiting non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics that
classical techniques may not fully capture. We compare clustering results based
on TDA-derived features versus classical statistical features using monthly
logarithmic returns of 13 major currency exchange rates (all against the euro).
Two widely-used clustering algorithms, \(k\)-means and Hierarchical clustering,
are applied on both types of features, and cluster quality is evaluated via the
Silhouette score and the Calinski-Harabasz index. Our findings show that
TDA-based feature clustering produces more compact and well-separated clusters
than clustering on traditional statistical features, particularly achieving
substantially higher Calinski-Harabasz scores. However, all clustering
approaches yield modest Silhouette scores, underscoring the inherent difficulty
of grouping FX time series. The differing cluster compositions under TDA vs.
classical features suggest that TDA captures structural patterns in currency
co-movements that conventional methods might overlook. These results highlight
TDA as a valuable complementary tool for analysing financial time series, with
potential applications in risk management where understanding structural
co-movements is crucial.

Method: 结合公开的CUAD数据集和专有合同数据，采用文本转换、分块选择、思维链提示和结构化工具调用等LLM优化技术。

Result: 实验结果显示在条款识别准确性和效率方面有显著提升，能够有效减少合同审查的时间和成本。

Conclusion: 经过优化的LLM系统可以作为法律专业人士的有价值工具，为各种规模的组织提供高效的合同审查服务。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models has revolutionized tasks across domains,
including the automation of legal document analysis, a critical component of
modern contract management systems. This paper presents a comprehensive
implementation of LLM-enhanced metadata extraction for contract review,
focusing on the automatic detection and annotation of salient legal clauses.
Leveraging both the publicly available Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset
(CUAD) and proprietary contract datasets, our work demonstrates the integration
of advanced LLM methodologies with practical applications. We identify three
pivotal elements for optimizing metadata extraction: robust text conversion,
strategic chunk selection, and advanced LLM-specific techniques, including
Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting and structured tool calling. The results from
our experiments highlight the substantial improvements in clause identification
accuracy and efficiency. Our approach shows promise in reducing the time and
cost associated with contract review while maintaining high accuracy in legal
clause identification. The results suggest that carefully optimized LLM systems
could serve as valuable tools for legal professionals, potentially increasing
access to efficient contract review services for organizations of all sizes.

*Corentin Pla,Hugo Richard,Marc Abeille,Nadav Merlis,Vianney Perchet*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文研究了强化学习中具有状态转移前瞻能力的情况，证明了当前瞻步数ℓ=1时，最优规划可在多项式时间内求解；但当ℓ≥2时，问题变为NP难问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究强化学习中状态转移前瞻对性能提升的影响，以及这种前瞻信息带来的计算复杂度边界问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的线性规划方法来解决ℓ=1时的最优规划问题，并分析了ℓ≥2时的计算复杂度。

Result: 证明了ℓ=1时问题可在多项式时间内求解，而ℓ≥2时问题变为NP难问题。

Conclusion: 明确了强化学习中状态转移前瞻规划问题的可解性边界，为ℓ=1和ℓ≥2两种情况提供了精确的计算复杂度区分。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) with transition look-ahead, where the
agent may observe which states would be visited upon playing any sequence of
$\ell$ actions before deciding its course of action. While such predictive
information can drastically improve the achievable performance, we show that
using this information optimally comes at a potentially prohibitive
computational cost. Specifically, we prove that optimal planning with one-step
look-ahead ($\ell=1$) can be solved in polynomial time through a novel linear
programming formulation. In contrast, for $\ell \geq 2$, the problem becomes
NP-hard. Our results delineate a precise boundary between tractable and
intractable cases for the problem of planning with transition look-ahead in
reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进生存分析中特征选择的方法，通过直接调整惩罚参数λ来进行特征选择，并利用Cox偏似然函数的平方根使其具有渐近枢轴性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视Cox比例风险模型和LASSO，旨在改进生存分析中的特征选择，克服传统交叉验证或BIC方法的局限性。

Method: 采用直接调整惩罚参数λ的方法进行特征选择，利用Cox偏似然函数的平方根使其具有渐近枢轴性，可应用于线性模型和人工神经网络。

Result: 该方法显著优于交叉验证LASSO和BIC子集选择，在检索所有且仅良好特征的概率上表现出相变特性，类似于压缩感知。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为生存分析中的特征选择提供了更有效的解决方案，具有更好的特征选择性能。

Abstract: We revisit Cox's proportional hazard models and LASSO in the aim of improving
feature selection in survival analysis. Unlike traditional methods relying on
cross-validation or BIC, the penalty parameter $\lambda$ is directly tuned for
feature selection and is asymptotically pivotal thanks to taking the square
root of Cox's partial likelihood. Substantially improving over both
cross-validation LASSO and BIC subset selection, our approach has a phase
transition on the probability of retrieving all and only the good features,
like in compressed sensing. The method can be employed by linear models but
also by artificial neural networks.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文研究了神经网络特征学习的结构发现，在更弱假设下证明了任意大小和深度的神经网络在二阶平稳点处会获得低秩结构，核心是一个去随机化引理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经网络特征学习的动态性是一个重要挑战。先前工作分析了特定设置下的低秩结构，但需要强假设。本文旨在在更弱条件下研究结构发现。

Method: 使用任意大小和深度的神经网络，所有参数可训练，在平滑损失函数、微小正则化下，通过任何能达到二阶平稳点的方法（如扰动梯度下降）进行训练。核心是去随机化引理。

Result: 证明了在二阶平稳点处，神经网络会获得低秩结构。去随机化引理表明优化期望函数会收敛到W=0的点，这直接解释了结构发现。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了对神经网络结构发现的更一般理解，去随机化引理具有基础性意义，并可直接应用于MAXCUT端到端近似和Johnson-Lindenstrauss嵌入计算等其他领域。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of feature learning in neural networks (NNs)
remains a significant challenge. The work of (Mousavi-Hosseini et al., 2023)
analyzes a multiple index teacher-student setting and shows that a two-layer
student attains a low-rank structure in its first-layer weights when trained
with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and a strong regularizer. This
structural property is known to reduce sample complexity of generalization.
Indeed, in a second step, the same authors establish algorithm-specific
learning guarantees under additional assumptions. In this paper, we focus
exclusively on the structure discovery aspect and study it under weaker
assumptions, more specifically: we allow (a) NNs of arbitrary size and depth,
(b) with all parameters trainable, (c) under any smooth loss function, (d) tiny
regularization, and (e) trained by any method that attains a second-order
stationary point (SOSP), e.g.\ perturbed gradient descent (PGD). At the core of
our approach is a key $\textit{derandomization}$ lemma, which states that
optimizing the function $\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}}
\left[g_{\theta}(\mathbf{W}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b})\right]$ converges to a
point where $\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{0}$, under mild conditions. The fundamental
nature of this lemma directly explains structure discovery and has immediate
applications in other domains including an end-to-end approximation for MAXCUT,
and computing Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings.

Motivation: 利用离线数据加速在线强化学习具有巨大潜力但缺乏理论支撑，研究如何在这种背景下学习和应用价值边界。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用离线数据推导价值函数的上界和下界；第二阶段将这些学习到的边界整合到在线算法中。通过解耦上下界实现更灵活和紧密的近似。

Conclusion: 该方法在离线预训练和在线微调之间建立了正式的桥梁，提供了由两个可解释量确定的高概率遗憾边界。

Abstract: We investigate the fundamental problem of leveraging offline data to
accelerate online reinforcement learning - a direction with strong potential
but limited theoretical grounding. Our study centers on how to learn and apply
value envelopes within this context. To this end, we introduce a principled
two-stage framework: the first stage uses offline data to derive upper and
lower bounds on value functions, while the second incorporates these learned
bounds into online algorithms. Our method extends prior work by decoupling the
upper and lower bounds, enabling more flexible and tighter approximations. In
contrast to approaches that rely on fixed shaping functions, our envelopes are
data-driven and explicitly modeled as random variables, with a filtration
argument ensuring independence across phases. The analysis establishes
high-probability regret bounds determined by two interpretable quantities,
thereby providing a formal bridge between offline pre-training and online
fine-tuning. Empirical results on tabular MDPs demonstrate substantial regret
reductions compared with both UCBVI and prior methods.
