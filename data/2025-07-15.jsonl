The continual need to update the learner with data arriving\nsequentially strikes inherent congruence between continual learning and\nBayesian inference which provides a principal platform to keep updating the\nprior beliefs of a model given new data, without completely forgetting the\nknowledge acquired from the old data. This survey inspects different settings\nof Bayesian continual learning, namely task-incremental learning and\nclass-incremental learning.

We challenge this paradigm by proposing\nConsistency Training of Variational AutoEncoders (CoVAE), a novel single-stage\ngenerative autoencoding framework that adopts techniques from consistency\nmodels to train a VAE architecture.

Although existing methods attempt to employ\nvarious compression techniques to reduce communication overhead, due to the\nparameter errors introduced by model compression, they inevitably suffer from\nmodel performance degradation. To simultaneously address the above problems,\nthis paper presents a communication-efficient FedRec framework named FedRAS,\nwhich adopts an action-sharing strategy to cluster the gradients of item\nembedding into a specific number of model updating actions for communication\nrather than directly compressing the item embeddings.

To further release the potential of HNOMA, this paper\nproposes a novel design of H-NOMA which jointly incorporates hybrid successive\ninterference cancellation (HSIC) and power adaptation (PA) in the NOMA\ntransmission phase. To reveal the potential of the proposed HSIC-PA aided\nH-NOMA scheme, closed-form expression for the probability of the event that\nH-NOMA can achieve a higher data rate than pure OMA by consuming less energy is\nrigorously derived. Furthermore, the asymptotic analysis demonstrates that the\nprobability of the proposed H-NOMA scheme approaches 1 in the high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime without any constraints on either users'\ntarget rates or transmit power ratios. This represents a significant\nimprovement over conventional H-NOMA schemes, which require specific\nrestrictive conditions to achieve probability 1 at high SNRs as shown in\nexisting work. The above observation indicates that with less energy\nconsumption, the proposed HSIC-PA aided H-NOMA can achieve a higher data rate\nthan pure OMA with probability 1 at high SNRs, and hence a higher energy\nefficiency. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the accuracy of\nthe analysis and also demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed\nH-NOMA scheme."}

While HMC is\nwidely regarded as a gold standard for uncertainty estimation, the\ncomputational demands limit its application to large-scale datasets and large\nDNN architectures. Although the predictions from the sampled DNN parameters can\nbe parallelized, the computational cost still scales linearly with the number\nof samples (similar to an ensemble). Last layer HMC (LL--HMC) reduces the\nrequired computations by restricting the HMC sampling to the final layer of a\nDNN, making it applicable to more data-intensive scenarios with limited\ncomputational resources. In this paper, we compare LL-HMC against five last\nlayer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL) methods across three real-world\nvideo datasets for driver action and intention. We evaluate the in-distribution\nclassification performance, calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD)\ndetection.

We challenge this paradigm by proposing\nConsistency Training of Variational AutoEncoders (CoVAE), a novel single-stage\ngenerative autoencoding framework that adopts techniques from consistency\nmodels to train a VAE architecture.

Submitted to the SynDAiTE: Synthetic Data for AI\n  Trustworthiness and Evolution workshop from ECMLPKDD 2025, anonymized", "summary": "Predictive models often reinforce biases which were originally embedded in\ntheir training data, through skewed decisions. In such cases, mitigation\nmethods are critical to ensure that, regardless of the prevailing disparities,\nmodel outcomes are adjusted to be fair. To assess this, datasets could be\nsystematically generated with specific biases, to train machine learning\nclassifiers. Then, predictive outcomes could aid in the understanding of this\nbias embedding process. Hence, an agent-based model (ABM), depicting a loan\napplication process that represents various systemic biases across two\ndemographic groups, was developed to produce synthetic datasets. Then, by\napplying classifiers trained on them to predict loan outcomes, we can assess\nhow biased data leads to unfairness. This highlights a main contribution of\nthis work: a framework for synthetic dataset generation with controllable bias\ninjection. We also contribute with a novel explainability technique, which\nshows how mitigations affect the way classifiers leverage data features, via\nsecond-order Shapley values. In experiments, both offline and online learning\napproaches are employed. Mitigations are applied at different stages of the\nmodelling pipeline, such as during pre-processing and in-processing."}

Such simulators are common across various scientific\ndisciplines; however, emulating their entire conditional probability\ndistribution is challenging, as it is a task traditional deterministic\nsurrogate modeling techniques are not designed for. Additionally, accurately\ncharacterizing the response distribution can require prohibitively large\ndatasets, especially for computationally expensive high-fidelity (HF)\nsimulators. When lower-fidelity (LF) stochastic simulators are available, they\ncan enhance limited HF information within a multifidelity surrogate modeling\n(MFSM) framework. While MFSM techniques are well-established for deterministic\nsettings, constructing multifidelity emulators to predict the full conditional\nresponse distribution of stochastic simulators remains a challenge. In this\npaper, we propose multifidelity generalized lambda models (MF-GLaMs) to\nefficiently emulate the conditional response distribution of HF stochastic\nsimulators by exploiting data from LF stochastic simulators. Our approach\nbuilds upon the generalized lambda model (GLaM), which represents the\nconditional distribution at each input by a flexible, four-parameter\ngeneralized lambda distribution. MF-GLaMs are non-intrusive, requiring no\naccess to the internal stochasticity of the simulators nor multiple\nreplications of the same input values. We demonstrate the efficacy of MF-GLaM\nthrough synthetic examples of increasing complexity and a realistic earthquake\napplication. Results show that MF-GLaMs can achieve improved accuracy at the\nsame cost as single-fidelity GLaMs, or comparable performance at significantly\nreduced cost."}

Inference emerges as a cycle of\nbidirectional interactions, bottom-up contextual disambiguation paired with\ntop-down content reconstruction, which resolves the Information Bottleneck in\nOptimal Transport (iBOT). Implemented via Rao-Blackwellized variational entropy\nminimization, CCUP steers representations toward minimal joint uncertainty\nwhile preserving inferential directionality. Local cycle completion underpins\ntemporal bootstrapping, chaining simulations to refine memory, and spatial\nbootstrapping, enabling compositional hierarchical inference. We prove a Delta\nConvergence Theorem showing that recursive entropy minimization yields\ndelta-like attractors in latent space, stabilizing perceptual schemas and motor\nplans. Temporal bootstrapping through perception-action loops and sleep-wake\nconsolidation further transforms episodic traces into semantic knowledge.\nExtending CCUP, each hierarchical level performs delta-seeded inference:\nlow-entropy content seeds diffuse outward along goal-constrained paths shaped\nby top-down priors and external context, confining inference to task-relevant\nmanifolds and circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Building on this, we\npropose that language emerges as a symbolic transport system, externalizing\nlatent content to synchronize inference cycles across individuals. Together,\nthese results establish iBOT as a foundational principle of information flow in\nboth individual cognition and collective intelligence, positioning recursive\ninference as the structured conduit through which minds adapt, align, and\nextend."}
