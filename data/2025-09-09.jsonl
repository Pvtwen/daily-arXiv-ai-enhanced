In\nprivacy-focused unlearning research, a retain set is often further divided into\nneighbor sets, containing either directly or indirectly connected to the forget\ntargets; and augmented by a general-knowledge set. A common practice in\nexisting benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general\nknowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and\nrelationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic\niteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto\nstandards have not been critically examined. In this study, we systematically\nevaluate these common practices. Our findings reveal that relying on a single\nneighbor set is suboptimal and that a standard sampling approach can obscure\nperformance trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we propose and validate an\ninitial set of best practices: (1) Incorporation of diverse neighbor sets to\nbalance forget efficacy and model utility, (2) Standard 1:1 sampling methods\nare inefficient and yield poor results, (3) Our proposed Modular Entity-Level\nUnlearning (MELU) strategy as an alternative to cyclic sampling.

Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which\nhampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be\nunsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is\noften not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning\nwith an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying\nthe labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the\nthreshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query\nstrategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to\nmaximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between\nanomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance\nof DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of\nmislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings\nindicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others\nappear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real\nworld, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and\nthe number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query\nstrategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of\nmislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an\nactive learning-based threshold is recommended."}

One of\nthe most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on\noptimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)\nsetting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we\nfocus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG\nsetting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs\nwhen the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian.\nTo extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein\nframework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly\nprojected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original\n(unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically\noptimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data.

Traditional oversampling\ntechniques, which are commonly used to alleviate class imbalance, have several\ndrawbacks: they treat features independently, lack similarity-based controls,\nlimit sample diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively. To\novercome these issues, we introduce AxelSMOTE, an innovative agent-based\napproach that views data instances as autonomous agents engaging in complex\ninteractions. Based on Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, AxelSMOTE\nimplements four key innovations: (1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve\ncorrelations; (2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for\nmeaningful interactions; (3) Beta distribution blending for realistic\ninterpolation; and (4) controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting.\nExperiments on eight imbalanced datasets demonstrate that AxelSMOTE outperforms\nstate-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency."}

Jay Kuo"], "title": "Green Learning for STAR-RIS mmWave Systems with Implicit CSI", "comment": "6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, accepted by 2025 IEEE Globecom", "summary": "In this paper, a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework is proposed\nfor simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface (STAR-RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO broadcasting systems.\nMotivated by the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability in future 6G\nnetworks, this work adopts a broadcasting transmission architecture for\nscenarios where multiple users share identical information, improving spectral\nefficiency and reducing redundant transmissions and power consumption.\nDifferent from conventional optimization methods, such as block coordinate\ndescent (BCD) that require perfect channel state information (CSI) and\niterative computation, the proposed GL framework operates directly on received\nuplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. Unlike deep learning (DL)\napproaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach\nalso avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more\nlightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with\nsupervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully\nCSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with\nadjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature\nselection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to\njointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral\nefficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point\noperations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the\nproposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and\nhardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios."}

Martina Neuman"], "title": "Learning from one graph: transductive learning guarantees via the geometry of small random worlds", "comment": null, "summary": "Since their introduction by Kipf and Welling in $2017$, a primary use of\ngraph convolutional networks is transductive node classification, where missing\nlabels are inferred within a single observed graph and its feature matrix.\nDespite the widespread use of the network model, the statistical foundations of\ntransductive learning remain limited, as standard inference frameworks\ntypically rely on multiple independent samples rather than a single graph. In\nthis work, we address these gaps by developing new concentration-of-measure\ntools that leverage the geometric regularities of large graphs via\nlow-dimensional metric embeddings. The emergent regularities are captured using\na random graph model; however, the methods remain applicable to deterministic\ngraphs once observed. We establish two principal learning results. The first\nconcerns arbitrary deterministic $k$-vertex graphs, and the second addresses\nrandom graphs that share key geometric properties with an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi\ngraph $\\mathbf{G}=\\mathbf{G}(k,p)$ in the regime $p \\in \\mathcal{O}((\\log\n(k)/k)^{1/2})$. The first result serves as the basis for and illuminates the\nsecond. We then extend these results to the graph convolutional network\nsetting, where additional challenges arise. Lastly, our learning guarantees\nremain informative even with a few labelled nodes $N$ and achieve the optimal\nnonparametric rate $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ as $N$ grows."}
