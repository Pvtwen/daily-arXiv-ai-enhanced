This work\nfocuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and\ncarrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for\nlocating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances\nchannel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an\nexisting multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot\n(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix\n(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs\ndifferent Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via\ncorrelation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a\ncorrelation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot\nstructure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is\nproposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the\ndelay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO\nestimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'\nsignals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical\nthreshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major\npeak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest\npeak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the\nproposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique\nreduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into\nmultiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to\neffectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO\nestimates for all the users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e0a\u884c\u591a\u7528\u6237OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u7387\u540c\u6b65\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b9a\u65f6\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u8f7d\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6821\u6b63\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u5b9a\u65f6\u504f\u79fb\uff08TOs\uff09\u548c\u8f7d\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\uff08CFOs\uff09\u5bf9\u591a\u7528\u6237OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cdTO\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eSU-PCP\u7684TO\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eMU-PCP\u7684TO\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528CPF-BEM\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5316CFO\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5bfc\u9891\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684TO\u548cCFO\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0a\u884c\u591a\u7528\u6237OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivated by\nthese difficulties and the growing interest in FASs, we propose in this paper a\ncomplete analytical model for metasurface-based embodiments of FASs.\nSpecifically, we advocate for the implementation of the FAS concept through\ndynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), hitherto proposed as array replacements in\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We leverage circuit theory to\nrewrite the conventional signal model of FASs in terms of admittance matrices\naccounting for the electromagnetic effects inherent to metasurfaces. The model\nis validated with full-wave simulations, showing good agreement. We further\nillustrate how to apply the model for standard performance analysis, and\nprovide closed-form expressions for key metrics, including the resulting signal\ncovariance matrix. Results confirm that practical DMA-based FASs can achieve\nsimilar performance to that of idealized implementations of position-flexible\nantennas.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08FAS\uff09\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u5929\u7ebf\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u5929\u7ebf\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08FAS\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7535\u8def\u7406\u8bba\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efaFAS\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u5929\u7ebf\uff08DMA\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0FAS\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u6ce2\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u543b\u5408\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9eDMA-based FAS\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7075\u6d3b\u5929\u7ebf\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u4e3aFAS\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86DMA-based FAS\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Furthermore, embedding constraints on the\nself-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the\nperformance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and\nattention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8c03\u6574\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9690\u85cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u5c06\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MLP\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7279\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728MLP\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u3002"}}

Geometric observations highlight\nthe unique characteristics of DPE errors stemming from multipath and thermal\nnoise as estimation bias and variance respectively. Expanding upon the\ntheoretical framework of DPE noise variance through geometric analysis, this\npaper focuses on a geometric representation of multipath errors by quantifying\nthe deviations in CAF and PVT solutions caused by off-centering bias relative\nto the azimuth and elevation angles. A satellite circular multipath bias (SCMB)\nmodel is introduced, amalgamating CAF and PVT errors from multiple satellite\nchannels. The boundaries for maximum or minimum PVT bias are established\nthrough discussions encompassing various multipath conditions. The correctness\nof the multipath geometrical portrait is confirmed through both Monte Carlo\nsimulations and urban canyon tests. The findings indicate that the maximum PVT\nbias depends on the largest multipath errors observed across various satellite\nchannels. Additionally, the PVT bias increases with satellite elevation angles,\ninfluenced by the CAF multipath bias projection.

Existing\nadaptive ensemble methods often rely on coarse-grained adaptation mechanisms or\nsimple voting schemes that fail to optimally leverage specialized knowledge.\nThis paper introduces DriftMoE, an online Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture\nthat addresses these limitations through a novel co-training framework.\nDriftMoE features a compact neural router that is co-trained alongside a pool\nof incremental Hoeffding tree experts. The key innovation lies in a symbiotic\nlearning loop that enables expert specialization: the router selects the most\nsuitable expert for prediction, the relevant experts update incrementally with\nthe true label, and the router refines its parameters using a multi-hot\ncorrectness mask that reinforces every accurate expert. This feedback loop\nprovides the router with a clear training signal while accelerating expert\nspecialization. We evaluate DriftMoE's performance across nine state-of-the-art\ndata stream learning benchmarks spanning abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts\ntesting two distinct configurations: one where experts specialize on data\nregimes (multi-class variant), and another where they focus on single-class\nspecialization (task-based variant).

The key idea lies\nin strategically controlling the signal envelope to mitigate memory-induced\nimpairments, such as nonlinearity, overshoot, peak-to-average power ratio\nenhancement, etc. The proposed scheme incorporates a dynamic selective mapping\n(DSLM) mechanism at the transmitter, enabling an untypical bit-to-symbol\nmapping in which the current symbol is not only determined by the current bits\npattern but also by previously generated symbols within a specified memory\nlength. At the receiver side, a turbo equalizer with a modified M-BCJR\nalgorithm is proposed to achieve the recovery of ambiguous bits induced by\nDSLM. Experimental verification in a 56GBaud PAM8 system demonstrates that the\nproposed scheme exhibits 1dB receiver sensitivity improvement over 2km\nsingle-mode fiber transmission.

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance\nmitigation strategy.

We\nprovide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the\nphenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the\nheavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior\nwork, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of\npretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either\ntesting or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics\nas well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.\nThe derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,\nincluding a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of\nthe Wilson Exact Renormalization Group.

In such contexts, it\nis often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\\it additional\nsupervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting\nnaturally raises fundamental questions: {\\it What kinds of additional\nsupervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\\it how do they contribute to\nimproved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a\ntheoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision\nas probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine\ncombination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of\nadditional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,\nbut rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled\nclasses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the\nmixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary\nroles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision\ndetermines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing\nthe hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the\nmixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction.

A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which\nis a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not\ntrivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study\nproposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a\ncombination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy\nof the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.\nThe SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the\ninner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear\ncombination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the\nbasis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term\n(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the\noptimization of the parametrized basis functions.

However, these models struggle with the irregularities\ninherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at\nnon-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.\nTo address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences\nrather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and\ncompromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel\narchitecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).\nTIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent\nirregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention\nmechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence\ninformation. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show\nthat TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%\nreduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below\n0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for\nbroader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series\ndata.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTIDSIT\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u7535\u6c60\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u6c60\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6548\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTIDSIT\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u53d8\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728NASA\u7535\u6c60\u9000\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTIDSIT\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e50%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e0.58%\u3002", "conclusion": "TIDSIT\u5728\u7535\u6c60\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}
