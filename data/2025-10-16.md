TL;DR: 提出基于有效连接性的通道重要性标准(ICEC)的无监督通道选择方法，通过计算通道间的有效连接强度来选择最相关通道，在三个EEG数据集上显著减少了通道数量并提高了分类准确率。

Motivation: EEG数据通常具有高维特性，并非所有通道都提供同等有意义的信息。选择最相关通道对于提高计算效率和确保对神经动力学的稳健洞察至关重要。

Method: 提出ICEC标准来量化每个通道的有效连接性，使用五种有效连接性度量(PDC、GPDC、RPDC、DTF、dDTF)计算通道间交互强度，结合CSP算法进行特征提取和SVM分类。

Result: 在三个EEG数据集上，该方法显著减少了通道数量(22个中选13个、59个中选29个、118个中选48个)，同时获得了最高的分类准确率：82%、86.01%和87.56%。

Conclusion: 基于有效连接性的通道选择方法能够有效减少EEG数据维度，同时提高分类性能，为神经数据分析提供了更高效和稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Analyzing neural data such as Electroencephalography (EEG) data often
involves dealing with high-dimensional datasets, where not all channels provide
equally meaningful informa- tion. Selecting the most relevant channels is
crucial for improving computational efficiency and ensuring robust insights
into neural dynamics. This study introduces the Importance of Channels based on
Effective Connectivity (ICEC) criterion for quantifying effective connectivity
(EC) in each channel. Effective connectivity refers to the causal influence one
neural region exerts over another, providing insights into the directional flow
of information. Using this criterion, we propose an unsupervised channel
selection method that accounts for the intensity of interactions among
channels. To evaluate the proposed channel selection method, we applied it to
three well-known EEG datasets across four categories. The assessment involved
calculating the ICEC criterion using five effective connectivity metrics:
partial directed coherence (PDC), generalized PDC (GPDC), renormalized PDC
(RPDC), directed transfer function (DTF), and direct DTF (dDTF). To focus on
the effect of channel selection, we employed the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)
algorithm for feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for
classification across all participants. Results were compared with other
CSP-based methods. The evaluation included comparing participant- specific
accuracies with and without the proposed method across five effective
connectivity metrics. The results showed consistent performance improvements
and a significant reduction in the number of selected electrodes for all
participants. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieved the
highest accuracies: 82% (13 out of 22 channels), 86.01% (29 out of 59
channels), and 87.56% (48 out of 118 channels) across three datasets.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in monostatic in-band full-duplex
(IBFD) systems encounters significant challenges due to self-interference (SI)
at the radar receiver during concurrent communication and radar operations.
This paper proposes a novel waveform-domain self-interference cancellation
(SIC) technique that leverages the unique properties of orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM)
signals. The proposed approach designs the integrated dual-functionality frame
to utilize OFDM for communication and AFDM for radar sensing, both generated
using the same modulator block. Then, we establish the conditions under which a
wide sense stationary (WSS) process in the time domain appears as WSS in the
affine domain and demonstrate that the interfering OFDM signal behaves as an
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) in this domain. Exploiting this property,
the received signal is projected into the affine domain, where the SI appears
as AWGN, enabling its subtraction with minimal residual interference. To
further mitigate the residual SI, an iterative low-complexity windowing scheme
is applied, selectively locking onto the radar signal to reduce the processed
signal space. A subsequent time-domain spreading step is applied after
converting the SIC-processed signal into the post-coded time domain, wherein
the SI diminishes separately across the delay and Doppler axes. The proposed
method demonstrates superior performance in terms of detection probability,
target range and velocity root mean square error (RMSE), while maintaining high
spectral efficiency and minimal computational complexity.

Abstract: We present an approach to identifying wireless microwave tags using radio
frequency (RF) fingerprinting and machine learning. The tags are designed for
low cost and simplicity, consisting of only two antennas and a single nonlinear
element (a diode). An interrogating transceiver transmits a signal consisting
of a set of individual frequency tones that is captured by the tag. The signal
response of the diode is nonlinear, and can be represented by an infinite power
series, the coefficients of which are similar but not identical for different
physical diodes due to small manufacturing perturbations. The small differences
in the signal responses manifest in the spectral signal response of the tag,
which is retransmitted back to the interrogating transceiver. Input into
machine learning algorithms, the slight differences in the spectral responses
of the diodes can be used to uniquely identify devices. To demonstrate the
concept, we designed 2.0 GHz tags consisting of patch antennas and a single
diode, along with a bi-static radar system operating at the 2.0 GHz 802.11
Wi-Fi band transmitting multi-tone continuous wave signals representing common
802.11 training fields. The received signals were processed using a set of
algorithms for comparison purposes. A real-time classification accuracy of 95%
between two tags was achieved.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种轴向自注意力变换器神经接收器，通过沿时间和频谱轴分解注意力操作，将复杂度从O((TF)^2)降低到O(T^2F+TF^2)，在5G兼容实验中实现了最先进的误块率性能和显著的计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为下一代无线系统重新定义物理层信号处理，开发适用于6G及以后无线系统的AI原生接收器，解决传统接收器在高移动性场景下的性能限制和计算复杂度问题。

Method: 采用轴向自注意力变换器架构，将注意力操作沿时间和频谱轴分解，减少传统多头自注意力的二次复杂度，同时保持高性能。

Result: 在3GPP CDL信道下，轴向神经接收器在非视距CDL-C条件下始终优于所有评估的接收器架构，包括全局自注意力、卷积神经接收器和传统LS-LMMSE，在10% BLER时具有更低计算复杂度。在1% BLER的严格可靠性目标下，传统LS-LMMSE接收器无法收敛，而轴向接收器仍能保持稳健的符号检测。

Conclusion: 轴向神经接收器为AI原生6G RAN系统提供了一个结构化、可扩展且高效的框架，适用于资源受限的边缘环境部署。

Abstract: Deep learning-based neural receivers are redefining physical-layer signal
processing for next-generation wireless systems. We propose an axial
self-attention transformer neural receiver designed for applicability to 6G and
beyond wireless systems, validated through 5G-compliant experimental
configurations, that achieves state-of-the-art block error rate (BLER)
performance with significantly improved computational efficiency. By
factorizing attention operations along temporal and spectral axes, the proposed
architecture reduces the quadratic complexity of conventional multi-head
self-attention from $O((TF)^2)$ to $O(T^2F+TF^2)$, yielding substantially fewer
total floating-point operations and attention matrix multiplications per
transformer block compared to global self-attention. Relative to convolutional
neural receiver baselines, the axial neural receiver achieves significantly
lower computational cost with a fraction of the parameters. Experimental
validation under 3GPP Clustered Delay Line (CDL) channels demonstrates
consistent performance gains across varying mobility scenarios. Under
non-line-of-sight CDL-C conditions, the axial neural receiver consistently
outperforms all evaluated receiver architectures, including global
self-attention, convolutional neural receivers, and traditional LS-LMMSE at
10\% BLER with reduced computational complexity per inference. At stringent
reliability targets of 1\% BLER, the axial receiver maintains robust symbol
detection at high user speeds, whereas the traditional LS-LMMSE receiver fails
to converge, underscoring its suitability for ultra-reliable low-latency
(URLLC) communication in dynamic 6G environments and beyond. These results
establish the axial neural receiver as a structured, scalable, and efficient
framework for AI-Native 6G RAN systems, enabling deployment in
resource-constrained edge environments.

### [6] [Constellation Design in OFDM-ISAC over Data Payloads: From MSE Analysis to Experimentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13101)
*Kawon Han,Kaitao Meng,Alexandra Chatzicharistou,Christos Masouros*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了OFDM-ISAC系统中多目标延迟估计的性能，分析了匹配滤波和互易滤波接收机的性能差异，并提出了基于接收机架构的ISAC星座设计方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFDM因其高频谱效率和与现代通信标准的兼容性，在ISAC系统中被广泛采用。本文旨在研究OFDM-ISAC在多目标延迟估计场景下的感知性能，特别是在不同雷达接收机处理方案下的表现。

Result: 研究发现，在多目标场景下，信号星座对延迟估计均方误差的影响因接收机而异：匹配滤波性能取决于零均值单位功率星座的四阶矩，而互易滤波性能取决于其二阶矩的倒数，且与目标数量无关。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了所提出的ISAC星座设计能够在OFDM-ISAC系统中实现接收机相关的灵活感知与通信权衡。

Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is one of the most widely
adopted waveforms for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems,
owing to its high spectral efficiency and compatibility with modern
communication standards. This paper investigates the sensing performance of
OFDM-based ISAC for multi-target delay (range) estimation under specific radar
receiver processing schemes. An estimation-theoretic framework is developed to
characterize sensing performance with random communication payloads. We
establish the fundamental limit of delay estimation accuracy by deriving the
closed-form expression of the mean-square error (MSE) achieved using matched
filtering (MF) and reciprocal filtering (RF) receivers. The results show that,
in multi-target scenarios, the impact of signal constellations on the delay
estimation MSE differs across receivers: MF performance depends on the
fourth-order moment of the zero-mean, unit-power constellation in the presence
of multiple targets, whereas RF performance depends on its inverse second-order
moment, irrespective of the number of targets. Building on this analysis, we
present a ISAC constellation design under specific receiver architecture that
brings a receiver-dependent flexible trade-off between sensing and
communication in OFDM-ISAC systems. The theoretical findings are validated
through simulations and proof-of-concept experiments, and also the sensing and
communication performance trade-off is experimentally shown with the proposed
constellation design.

Motivation: 早期检测痴呆症特别是阿尔茨海默病至关重要，工作记忆损伤是神经退化的关键早期指标。EEG因其高时间分辨率和成本效益，成为评估脑动力学的理想方法。

Method: 对24名参与者（8名AD、8名MCI、8名健康对照）进行工作记忆任务EEG记录，使用SHD和HHD进行特征提取，采用CPTE和PLI量化功能连接，使用SVM、随机森林和XGBoost分类器分析网络指标。

Conclusion: 工作记忆任务与EEG功能连接分析的结合为痴呆分类提供了稳健框架，CPTE方法为神经退行性疾病的早期检测和监测提供了强大、可扩展、非侵入性的诊断工具。

Abstract: Background: Dementia, particularly Alzheimer's Disease (AD), is a progressive
neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline. Early detection,
especially at the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage, is essential for
timely intervention. Working Memory (WM) impairment is a key early indicator of
neurodegeneration, affecting higher cognitive processes. Electroencephalography
(EEG), with its high temporal resolution, offers a cost-effective method to
assess brain dynamics. This study investigates WM-related EEG functional
connectivity (FC) to identify brain network alterations across dementia stages.
Methods: EEG signals were recorded from 24 participants (8 AD, 8 MCI, and 8
healthy controls) during WM tasks, including encoding, recall, and retrieval
stages. Data preprocessing involved noise reduction and feature extraction
using Spherical and Head Harmonic Decomposition (SHD, HHD). FC was quantified
using Cross-Plot Transition Entropy (CPTE) and Phase Lag Index (PLI). Network
metrics such as Degree and Eigenvector Centrality were analyzed using Support
Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers. Results: The CPTE-based
connectivity metrics outperformed the traditional PLI approach in
differentiating dementia stages, attaining a peak classification accuracy of
97.53% during the retrieval phase with the Random Forest model. A connectivity
threshold of 0.5 was optimal for network discrimination. SHD and HHD features
also demonstrated strong discriminative potential. AD subjects exhibited higher
synchronization patterns during WM tasks than healthy controls. Conclusions:
The integration of WM tasks with EEG-based FC analysis provides a robust
framework for dementia classification. The proposed CPTE-based approach offers
a robust, scalable, non-invasive, and effective diagnostic tool for early
detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卡尔曼滤波的几何漂移补偿算法，用于校正移动多传感器信道探测中的同步失配问题，并通过高分辨率参数估计后的相对剩余功率作为评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 基于卡尔曼滤波的几何漂移补偿方法能有效校正同步失配，提高多传感器信道探测数据的质量，为分布式ISAC系统提供更准确的相位同步。

Abstract: We observed synchronization mismatches in the form of non-smooth phase
progressions and drifts within mobile multisensor channel sounding
measurements. However, performing Doppler estimation in a distributed
multisensor integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system requires
coherence among the nodes, which implies a continuously differentiable phase
progression of the received signals. To correct the sounding data in
post-processing, we extend traditional geometry-based drift compensation
algorithms by utilizing Kalman filtering for line-of-sight (LoS) tracking,
which improves the robustness of the LoS estimate in multipath scenarios. This
approach smooths the phase progression and enables the correction of
time-varying drifts while preserving relative sensor motion. Furthermore, we
propose using the relative residual power after high-resolution parameter
estimation (HRPE) as a metric for ground-truth-independent comparison of
post-processing synchronization methods for recorded channel sounding data.
Results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional LoS estimation
heuristics, reducing the relative residual power by more than 5 dB and the
delay-Doppler estimate root mean square errors (RMSEs) by approximately 60 %.

Abstract: Recent advancements in polymer microwave fiber (PMF) technology have created
significant opportunities for robust, low-cost, and high-speed sub-terahertz
(THz) radio-over- fiber communications. Recognizing these potential benefits,
this paper explores a novel radio-over-fiber (RoF) structure that interconnects
multiple radio units (RUs) in cascade via fiber, envi- sioning its application
in indoor scenarios. This structure creates a number of research opportunities
when considering cascaded distortion effects introduced by non-linear power
amplifiers (PAs) at the RUs and the propagation channel over the fiber. We
propose maximum-likelihood and non-linear least-squares algorithms to estimate
the propagation distance along the RoF and the time-of-arrival between the RoF
and the user equipment. For the case of linear PAs, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao
lower bound to benchmark the performance of the estimators. Finally, we
investigate the use of the system for uplink positioning. Our simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed estimators perform satisfactorily even
with the cascaded effects of non- linear PAs, and that the deployment of this
RoF structure can enable new cost-effective opportunities for high-resolution
positioning in indoor scenarios. In the numerical evaluation, we also use
measured PMF characteristics for high-density polyethylene fibers.

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功地将三个关键要素整合到计算可行的模型中，为3D单源定位提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: For the problem of source localization, three elements usually play a very
important role in accurate localization. They are the range measurements, the
angle measurements and the least absolute deviation criterion, which is
regarded as a robust metric for denoising the measurements. Building the three
elements into a computationally tractable model is challenging. In this paper,
we introduce a robust Euclidean Distance Matrix (EDM) optimization model that
simultaneously incorporates the three elements. For the first time, we show
that for the case of 3D single-source localization (3DSSL), the angle
measurements can be represented as a simple box constraint of distances. It is
achieved by reducing each of the 3D angle measurements to a two-dimensional
nonlinear optimization problem, whose global minimum and maximum solutions can
be characterized and utilized to get the lower and upper bounds of the
distances from the unknown source to the sensors. We further develop an
efficient algorithm. The high quality of the localization by the new EDM model
is assessed through extensive numerical experiments in comparison with leading
solvers for 3DSSL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了LT-Gate脉冲神经元模型，结合双时间尺度动态和自适应门控机制，解决了SNN在持续学习中快速适应和长期记忆的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络在神经形态硬件上具有能效优势，但在需要同时实现快速适应和长期记忆的持续学习任务中存在困难，特别是稳定性-可塑性困境。

Method: 每个脉冲神经元并行跟踪快速和慢速时间尺度信息，通过学习的门控机制局部调整其影响，并引入方差跟踪正则化来稳定放电活动。

Result: 在时序分类基准测试中达到约51%的最终准确率，优于Hebbian持续学习基线的约46%和先前的SNN方法，且无需外部重放或昂贵的正交化操作。

Conclusion: 多时间尺度门控可以显著增强SNN的持续学习能力，缩小脉冲网络与传统深度网络在终身学习任务上的差距，并完全兼容神经形态硬件。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient artificial
intelligence on neuromorphic hardware but struggle with tasks requiring both
fast adaptation and long-term memory, especially in continual learning. We
propose Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate), a neuron model that combines dual
time-constant dynamics with an adaptive gating mechanism. Each spiking neuron
tracks information on a fast and a slow timescale in parallel, and a learned
gate locally adjusts their influence. This design enables individual neurons to
preserve slow contextual information while responding to fast signals,
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. We further introduce a
variance-tracking regularization that stabilizes firing activity, inspired by
biological homeostasis. Empirically, LT-Gate yields significantly improved
accuracy and retention in sequential learning tasks: on a challenging temporal
classification benchmark it achieves about 51 percent final accuracy, compared
to about 46 percent for a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline and lower
for prior SNN methods. Unlike approaches that require external replay or
expensive orthogonalizations, LT-Gate operates with local updates and is fully
compatible with neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it leverages features of
Intel's Loihi chip (multiple synaptic traces with different decay rates) for
on-chip learning. Our results demonstrate that multi-timescale gating can
substantially enhance continual learning in SNNs, narrowing the gap between
spiking and conventional deep networks on lifelong-learning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从信息瓶颈理论重新审视Koopman算子学习，提出通过信息论拉格朗日公式平衡表示的简洁性和表达能力，解决了深度架构中有限维子空间识别的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Koopman算子的无限维特性使得寻找合适的有限维子空间具有挑战性，特别是在深度架构中。作者认为这些困难源于次优的表示学习，其中潜在变量未能平衡表达能力和简洁性。

Method: 提出基于信息论的拉格朗日公式，通过潜在互信息促进简洁性，通过冯·诺依曼熵维持表达能力，防止潜在空间崩溃到少数主导模式。开发了相应的算法来平衡这种权衡。

Result: 在多种动态系统上验证了该方法，相比现有Koopman学习方法表现出改进的性能。可视化学习到的流形与理论预测一致，获得了稳定且可解释的Koopman表示。

Conclusion: 通过信息论视角重新思考Koopman学习，提出的方法能够平衡简洁性和表达能力，产生稳定且可解释的表示，在多个动态系统上优于现有方法。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical
systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community.
However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable
finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We
argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning,
where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This
tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma:
constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive.
Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent
mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may
cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast,
expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such
collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an
information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this
tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian
formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a
stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative
evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our
representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical
predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of
dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman
learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.

*Liangwei Nathan Zheng,Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM4TS模型中的伪对齐问题，发现其源于预训练LLM的锥效应与时序数据低维流形的相互作用，并提出了TimeSUP方法来缓解该问题，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪对齐问题是LLM4TS模型普遍面临的挑战，导致其性能不如线性模型或随机初始化骨干网络，但社区对此问题的根源讨论有限。

Method: 提出了TimeSUP方法，通过增加时间序列流形维度使其更接近语言嵌入的内在维度，从而让模型能清晰区分时序信号，同时捕捉跨模态的共享结构。

Result: TimeSUP在长期预测性能上持续优于最先进的LLM4TS方法和其他轻量级基线，并能无缝集成到四个现有LLM4TS流程中，显著提升预测性能。

Conclusion: 伪对齐源于LLM锥效应与时序数据低维流形的相互作用，TimeSUP通过调整流形维度有效缓解了这一问题，在保持各模态独特特征的同时学习其共性。

Abstract: Pseudo-Alignment is a pervasive challenge in many large language models for
time series (LLM4TS) models, often causing them to underperform compared to
linear models or randomly initialised backbones. However, there is limited
discussion in the community for the reasons that pseudo-alignment occurs. In
this work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of
pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the
cone effect in LLM. We demonstrate that pseudo-alignment arises from the
interplay of cone effect within pretrained LLM components and the intrinsically
low-dimensional manifold of time-series data. In addition, we also introduce
\textit{\textbf{TimeSUP}}, a novel technique designed to mitigate this issue
and improve forecast performance in existing LLM4TS approaches. TimeSUP
addresses this by increasing the time series manifold to more closely match the
intrinsic dimension of language embeddings, allowing the model to distinguish
temporal signals clearly while still capturing shared structures across
modalities. As a result, representations for time and language tokens remain
distinct yet exhibit high cosine similarity, signifying that the model
preserves each modality unique features while learning their commonalities in a
unified embedding space. Empirically, TimeSUP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and other lightweight baselines on long-term
forecasting performance. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into four
existing LLM4TS pipelines and delivers significant improvements in forecasting
performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从时变优化角度研究流数据学习问题，提出了基于权重的结构化公式，分析了均匀权重和折扣权重两种策略下的跟踪误差边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典优化理论处理固定目标函数，而时变优化在动态环境决策中日益重要。本文旨在通过时变优化视角研究流数据学习问题。

Method: 引入基于权重的结构化公式，明确捕捉流数据的时变目标特性。分析均匀权重和折扣权重两种策略，在梯度下降更新下推导跟踪误差的紧致边界。

Result: 均匀权重下跟踪误差以O(1/t)速率渐近消失，折扣权重会产生非零误差下限，受折扣因子和每时间步梯度更新次数控制。数值模拟验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 权重策略对跟踪误差有显著影响：均匀权重可实现渐近最优，折扣权重在有限误差下提供遗忘机制，为流数据学习提供理论指导。

Abstract: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective
functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important
subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the
problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization
lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a
structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the
streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step,
an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data
samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,
which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which
geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive
tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between
the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under
gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE
vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas
discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount
factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our
theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.

*Haolin Li,Hoda Bidkhori*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedGTEA是一个联邦类增量学习框架，通过高斯任务嵌入和对齐来捕获任务特定知识，在保持通信效率的同时解决统计异质性和遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中的类增量学习问题，特别是在长任务序列中保持可扩展性，同时处理统计异质性和保护任务级隐私。

Method: 客户端使用参数大小固定的Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder生成高斯分布的任务嵌入；服务器端使用2-Wasserstein距离测量任务间差距，并制定Wasserstein损失来增强任务分离。

Result: 在多个流行数据集上的实验表明，FedGTEA实现了优越的分类性能，显著减轻了遗忘问题，并持续优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FedGTEA通过概率化任务嵌入和对齐方法，在联邦类增量学习中有效平衡了性能、可扩展性和隐私保护。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning,
called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is
designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable
and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the
Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task
embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and
quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size
regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task
sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to
measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the
Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic
formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves
task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings,
aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive
empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves
superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting,
consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.

TL;DR: 论文展示了在振荡器伊辛机(OIMs)上实现平衡传播(EP)的方法，将优化和采样统一到单一能量景观上，在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上达到竞争性精度，同时保持对硬件约束的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用物理系统自然执行能量下降的特性来加速机器学习，特别是将能量基模型(EBMs)的优化直接映射到物理硬件动力学上，避免传统处理器的瓶颈。

Method: 在振荡器伊辛机(OIMs)上实现平衡传播(EP)，将优化和采样统一到单一总能量景观上，使用局部学习规则而非全局反向传播。

Result: 在MNIST上达到97.2±0.1%的准确率，在Fashion-MNIST上达到88.0±0.1%的准确率，同时在参数量化和相位噪声等现实硬件约束下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OIMs为神经形态学习提供了快速、节能的硬件基础，表明EBMs可以在直接执行其优化的物理硬件上实现实际应用。

Abstract: Physical systems that naturally perform energy descent offer a direct route
to accelerating machine learning. Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) exemplify
this idea: their GHz-frequency dynamics mirror both the optimization of
energy-based models (EBMs) and gradient descent on loss landscapes, while
intrinsic noise corresponds to Langevin dynamics - supporting sampling as well
as optimization. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) unifies these processes into
descent on a single total energy landscape, enabling local learning rules
without global backpropagation. We show that EP on OIMs achieves competitive
accuracy ($\sim 97.2 \pm 0.1 \%$ on MNIST, $\sim 88.0 \pm 0.1 \%$ on
Fashion-MNIST), while maintaining robustness under realistic hardware
constraints such as parameter quantization and phase noise. These results
establish OIMs as a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning,
and suggest that EBMs - often bottlenecked by conventional processors - may
find practical realization on physical hardware whose dynamics directly perform
their optimization.

*James Pedley,Benjamin Etheridge,Stephen J. Roberts,Francesco Quinzan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次为状态对抗马尔可夫决策过程(SA-MDPs)中的剪枝认证鲁棒性建立了理论框架，证明了剪枝可以收紧鲁棒性边界，并揭示了性能-鲁棒性的权衡边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的强化学习策略需要在对抗扰动下保持可靠性，而现代深度RL代理过度参数化导致成本增加和脆弱性问题。虽然剪枝在监督学习中已被证明能提高鲁棒性，但其在对抗RL中的作用尚未被充分理解。

Method: 开发了首个针对SA-MDPs中剪枝认证鲁棒性的理论框架，分析了高斯和分类策略在Lipschitz网络下的剪枝效果，提出了三阶段遗憾分解方法，并在连续控制基准上评估了幅度剪枝和微剪枝策略。

Result: 实验发现在中等稀疏度水平存在可复现的"最佳点"，剪枝能显著提高鲁棒性而不损害甚至有时能提升干净性能，剪枝不仅作为压缩工具，更是增强RL鲁棒性的结构干预手段。

Conclusion: 剪枝在对抗强化学习中具有重要作用，能够在不牺牲性能的前提下提高策略的鲁棒性，揭示了性能与鲁棒性之间的基本权衡关系。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in real-world environments must
remain reliable under adversarial perturbations. At the same time, modern deep
RL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns.
While pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its
role in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first
theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in
state-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and
categorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise
pruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the
policy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret
decomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced
performance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental
performance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and
micro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong
policy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers
reproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness
improves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean
performance. These results position pruning not merely as a compression tool
but as a structural intervention for robust RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大规模匿名电子健康记录训练的基础模型在临床应用中具有潜力，但其记忆患者信息的能力引发了重要的隐私担忧，特别是对弱势群体的潜在风险。

Method: 开发了一套黑盒评估测试，包括在嵌入层和生成层探测记忆的方法，旨在区分模型泛化和有害记忆，并在临床相关环境中验证。

Result: 在公开可用的EHR基础模型上验证了该方法，并发布了开源工具包以促进医疗AI中可复现和协作的隐私评估。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估EHR基础模型的隐私风险提供了系统方法，有助于识别和缓解患者隐私泄露风险，特别是在临床应用中保护弱势群体。

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale de-identified electronic health
records (EHRs) hold promise for clinical applications. However, their capacity
to memorize patient information raises important privacy concerns. In this
work, we introduce a suite of black-box evaluation tests to assess
privacy-related memorization risks in foundation models trained on structured
EHR data. Our framework includes methods for probing memorization at both the
embedding and generative levels, and aims to distinguish between model
generalization and harmful memorization in clinically relevant settings. We
contextualize memorization in terms of its potential to compromise patient
privacy, particularly for vulnerable subgroups. We validate our approach on a
publicly available EHR foundation model and release an open-source toolkit to
facilitate reproducible and collaborative privacy assessments in healthcare AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基准数据集（如MNIST）往往无法暴露潜在偏见和多模态特征复杂性，限制了深度神经网络在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: 统一了注意力增强特征融合、基于Grad-CAM++的局部解释以及用于偏见检测和缓解的Reveal-to-Revise反馈循环的多模态可解释AI框架。

Result: 在MNIST多模态扩展数据集上实现了93.2%的分类准确率、91.6%的F1分数和78.1%的解释保真度（IoU-XAI），优于单模态和非可解释基线。消融研究表明，将可解释性与偏见感知学习相结合可增强鲁棒性和人类对齐。

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了性能、透明度和公平性之间的差距，为敏感领域中的可信AI提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Standard benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, often fail to expose latent
biases and multimodal feature complexities, limiting the trustworthiness of
deep neural networks in high-stakes applications. We propose a novel multimodal
Explainable AI (XAI) framework that unifies attention-augmented feature fusion,
Grad-CAM++-based local explanations, and a Reveal-to-Revise feedback loop for
bias detection and mitigation. Evaluated on multimodal extensions of MNIST, our
approach achieves 93.2% classification accuracy, 91.6% F1-score, and 78.1%
explanation fidelity (IoU-XAI), outperforming unimodal and non-explainable
baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that integrating interpretability with
bias-aware learning enhances robustness and human alignment. Our work bridges
the gap between performance, transparency, and fairness, highlighting a
practical pathway for trustworthy AI in sensitive domains.

*Athyrson Machado Ribeiro,Marcos Medeiros Raimundo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的拒绝推断框架CI-EX，通过置信内点外推方法处理信用申请中的样本偏差问题，在保持AUC竞争力的同时，在拒绝推断特定指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拒绝推断方法假设被拒客户的行为可以从已接受客户外推，但忽略了两个群体之间可能存在的分布差异，导致盲目外推问题。

Method: CI-EX框架迭代地使用异常检测模型识别被拒客户样本的分布，并基于监督分类模型的概率为最接近已接受群体分布的个体分配标签。

Result: 在两个大型真实信用数据集上的实验表明，CI-EX在拒绝推断特定指标（如Kickout和新提出的Area under the Kickout）上持续优于现有方法，同时在AUC指标上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 拒绝推断方法通常需要在AUC和拒绝推断特定指标之间权衡，但提出的CI-EX框架在拒绝推断特定指标上表现更优，同时维持了AUC的竞争性能。

Abstract: Reject Inference (RI) methods aim to address sample bias by inferring missing
repayment data for rejected credit applicants. Traditional approaches often
assume that the behavior of rejected clients can be extrapolated from accepted
clients, despite potential distributional differences between the two
populations. To mitigate this blind extrapolation, we propose a novel Confident
Inlier Extrapolation framework (CI-EX). CI-EX iteratively identifies the
distribution of rejected client samples using an outlier detection model and
assigns labels to rejected individuals closest to the distribution of the
accepted population based on probabilities derived from a supervised
classification model. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated
through experiments on two large real-world credit datasets. Performance is
evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as well as RI-specific metrics
such as Kickout and a novel metric introduced in this work, denoted as Area
under the Kickout. Our findings reveal that RI methods, including the proposed
framework, generally involve a trade-off between AUC and RI-specific metrics.
However, the proposed CI-EX framework consistently outperforms existing RI
models from the credit literature in terms of RI-specific metrics while
maintaining competitive performance in AUC across most experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用去噪分数匹配损失作为局部内在维度(LID)的估计器，该方法相比现有方法具有更好的计算效率和内存占用表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的LID估计方法需要多次前向传播或梯度计算，在计算和内存受限场景下适用性有限。

Method: 通过理论证明LID是去噪分数匹配损失的下界，从而将去噪分数匹配损失作为LID估计器。同时分析了隐式分数匹配损失与FLIPD估计器的关系。

Result: 在流形基准测试和Stable Diffusion 3.5上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和内存占用方面优于现有方法，特别是在问题规模和量化级别增加时。

Conclusion: 去噪分数匹配损失是一种高竞争力且可扩展的LID估计器，在计算效率和内存使用方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: The local intrinsic dimension (LID) of data is a fundamental quantity in
signal processing and learning theory, but quantifying the LID of
high-dimensional, complex data has been a historically challenging task. Recent
works have discovered that diffusion models capture the LID of data through the
spectra of their score estimates and through the rate of change of their
density estimates under various noise perturbations. While these methods can
accurately quantify LID, they require either many forward passes of the
diffusion model or use of gradient computation, limiting their applicability in
compute- and memory-constrained scenarios.
  We show that the LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss,
motivating use of the denoising score matching loss as a LID estimator.
Moreover, we show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss also
approximates LID via the normal dimension and is closely related to a recent
LID estimator, FLIPD. Our experiments on a manifold benchmark and with Stable
Diffusion 3.5 indicate that the denoising score matching loss is a highly
competitive and scalable LID estimator, achieving superior accuracy and memory
footprint under increasing problem size and quantization level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模多用户MISO系统中下行波束成形的实时计算挑战，传统迭代方法计算复杂，无法满足动态通信环境的实时性要求。

Method: 采用学习优化范式，使用多层Transformer通过残差连接迭代优化信道和波束成形特征，并引入课程学习、半摊销学习和滑动窗口训练三种策略增强训练效果。

Result: 在低到中等信噪比下优于现有基线方法，在高信噪比下接近WMMSE性能，推理速度比迭代和在线学习方法快得多。

Conclusion: 该无监督深度学习框架为大规模MIMO系统提供了一种高效的波束成形解决方案，平衡了性能与计算效率。

Abstract: We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming
in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing
real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic
communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm,
a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer
features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are
introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and
avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer
block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to
stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a
time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing
baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at
high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and
online learning approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型的遗忘评估指标基于参考响应或分类器输出，而非评估核心目标：遗忘模型是否与从未见过不想要数据的模型行为无法区分。这种参考特定方法存在系统性盲点。

Method: 提出FADE指标，通过比较未学习模型和参考模型在生成样本上的双向似然分配来测量分布相似性，捕捉整个输出分布的功能对齐。

Result: 在TOFU和UnlearnCanvas基准测试中，传统指标接近最优的方法未能实现分布等价，许多模型在遗忘后反而与黄金标准距离更远。

Conclusion: 当前评估实践存在根本性差距，FADE为开发和评估真正有效的遗忘方法提供了更稳健的基础。

Abstract: Current unlearning metrics for generative models evaluate success based on
reference responses or classifier outputs rather than assessing the core
objective: whether the unlearned model behaves indistinguishably from a model
that never saw the unwanted data. This reference-specific approach creates
systematic blind spots, allowing models to appear successful while retaining
unwanted knowledge accessible through alternative prompts or attacks. We
address these limitations by proposing Functional Alignment for Distributional
Equivalence (FADE), a novel metric that measures distributional similarity
between unlearned and reference models by comparing bidirectional likelihood
assignments over generated samples. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
predetermined references, FADE captures functional alignment across the entire
output distribution, providing a principled assessment of genuine unlearning.
Our experiments on the TOFU benchmark for LLM unlearning and the UnlearnCanvas
benchmark for text-to-image diffusion model unlearning reveal that methods
achieving near-optimal scores on traditional metrics fail to achieve
distributional equivalence, with many becoming more distant from the gold
standard than before unlearning. These findings expose fundamental gaps in
current evaluation practices and demonstrate that FADE provides a more robust
foundation for developing and assessing truly effective unlearning methods.

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) prediction is a promising strategy for
ensuring reliable and efficient operation of massive multiple-input
multiple-output (mMIMO) systems by providing timely downlink (DL) CSI. While
deep learning-based methods have advanced beyond conventional model-driven and
statistical approaches, they remain limited in robustness to practical
non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and
computational efficiency. This paper introduces CSI-4CAST, a hybrid deep
learning architecture that integrates 4 key components, i.e., Convolutional
neural network residuals, Adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and
Transformers, to efficiently capture both local and long-range dependencies in
CSI prediction. To enable rigorous evaluation, this work further presents a
comprehensive benchmark, CSI-RRG for Regular, Robustness and Generalization
testing, which includes more than 300,000 samples across 3,060 realistic
scenarios for both TDD and FDD systems. The dataset spans multiple channel
models, a wide range of delay spreads and user velocities, and diverse noise
types and intensity degrees. Experimental results show that CSI-4CAST achieves
superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost,
outperforming baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenario,
the best performance among all evaluated models, while reducing FLOPs by 5x and
3x compared to LLM4CP, the strongest baseline. In addition, evaluation over
CSI-RRG provides valuable insights into how different channel factors affect
the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models. Both the
dataset (https://huggingface.co/CSI-4CAST) and evaluation protocols
(https://github.com/AI4OPT/CSI-4CAST) are publicly released to establish a
standardized benchmark and to encourage further research on robust and
efficient CSI prediction.

Motivation: 刚性系统的时间积分是燃烧、高超声速等反应输运系统中计算成本的主要来源，需要开发能够缓解刚性挑战的策略。

Method: 开发AMORE框架，包含多输出预测算子和自适应损失函数；设计自动满足单位分解的trunk网络；提出可逆分析映射来处理质量分数约束；采用两步训练方法。

Conclusion: AMORE是一个通用框架，提出的DeepONet将成为未来CFD研究的基础，用于加速湍流燃烧模拟。

Abstract: Time integration of stiff systems is a primary source of computational cost
in combustion, hypersonics, and other reactive transport systems. This
stiffness can introduce time scales significantly smaller than those associated
with other physical processes, requiring extremely small time steps in explicit
schemes or computationally intensive implicit methods. Consequently, strategies
to alleviate challenges posed by stiffness are important. While neural
operators (DeepONets) can act as surrogates for stiff kinetics, a reliable
operator learning strategy is required to appropriately account for differences
in the error between output variables and samples. Here, we develop AMORE,
Adaptive Multi-Output Operator Network, a framework comprising an operator
capable of predicting multiple outputs and adaptive loss functions ensuring
reliable operator learning. The operator predicts all thermochemical states
from given initial conditions. We propose two adaptive loss functions within
the framework, considering each state variable's and sample's error to penalize
the loss function. We designed the trunk to automatically satisfy Partition of
Unity. To enforce unity mass-fraction constraint exactly, we propose an
invertible analytical map that transforms the $n$-dimensional species
mass-fraction vector into an ($n-1$)-dimensional space, where DeepONet training
is performed. We consider two-step training for DeepONet for multiple outputs
and extend adaptive loss functions for trunk and branch training. We
demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of our models through two examples:
the syngas (12 states) and GRI-Mech 3.0 (24 active states out of 54). The
proposed DeepONet will be a backbone for future CFD studies to accelerate
turbulent combustion simulations. AMORE is a general framework, and here, in
addition to DeepONet, we also demonstrate it for FNO.

Conclusion: 现有基准可能无法全面捕捉数学推理能力的全谱系，揭示了当前评估实践中的关键差距。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable
reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through
intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers.
However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning
capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e.
finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that
underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and
prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems,
curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and
transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct
extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model
families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that
LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of
current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models
showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills,
and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current
evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not
comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了KL正则化在博弈论环境中的理论优势，提出了OMG和SOMG算法，在矩阵博弈和马尔可夫博弈中实现了与KL正则化强度β相关的对数级遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管KL正则化在强化学习对齐中取得了经验成功，但其在博弈论环境中的理论优势仍未得到充分理解。

Method: 提出了OMG算法（基于最佳响应采样和乐观奖励）用于矩阵博弈，以及SOMG算法（使用最佳响应采样和超乐观奖励）用于马尔可夫博弈。

Result: 两种算法都实现了与T相关的对数级遗憾，该遗憾与KL正则化强度β成反比，同时还保持了标准的√T遗憾。

Conclusion: KL正则化在博弈论环境中确实能提供理论上的样本效率优势，特别是在强正则化情况下。

Abstract: Reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization with respect to
a fixed reference policy is widely used in modern reinforcement learning to
preserve the desired traits of the reference policy and sometimes to promote
exploration (using uniform reference policy, known as entropy regularization).
Beyond serving as a mere anchor, the reference policy can also be interpreted
as encoding prior knowledge about good actions in the environment. In the
context of alignment, recent game-theoretic approaches have leveraged KL
regularization with pretrained language models as reference policies, achieving
notable empirical success in self-play methods. Despite these advances, the
theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings remain
poorly understood. In this work, we develop and analyze algorithms that
provably achieve improved sample efficiency under KL regularization. We study
both two-player zero-sum Matrix games and Markov games: for Matrix games, we
propose OMG, an algorithm based on best response sampling with optimistic
bonuses, and extend this idea to Markov games through the algorithm SOMG, which
also uses best response sampling and a novel concept of superoptimistic
bonuses. Both algorithms achieve a logarithmic regret in $T$ that scales
inversely with the KL regularization strength $\beta$ in addition to the
standard $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret independent of $\beta$
which is attained in both regularized and unregularized settings

Motivation: 现有聚类有效性指标通常是相对的，依赖于数据结构和算法比较，难以直接识别"真实"簇。需要开发绝对指标来直接评估聚类的紧凑性和分离性。

Method: 定义每个簇的紧凑度函数和簇对之间的邻域点集，利用这些函数计算单个簇的紧凑度和整体聚类分布的紧凑性，使用邻域点集定义簇间边界和整体分布边界。

Conclusion: 提出的绝对聚类指数能够有效评估聚类的紧凑性和分离性，为确定真实簇数量提供了新的工具，在多种数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Finding "true" clusters in a data set is a challenging problem. Clustering
solutions obtained using different models and algorithms do not necessarily
provide compact and well-separated clusters or the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster validity indices are commonly applied to identify such clusters.
Nevertheless, these indices are typically relative, and they are used to
compare clustering algorithms or choose the parameters of a clustering
algorithm. Moreover, the success of these indices depends on the underlying
data structure. This paper introduces novel absolute cluster indices to
determine both the compactness and separability of clusters. We define a
compactness function for each cluster and a set of neighboring points for
cluster pairs. This function is utilized to determine the compactness of each
cluster and the whole cluster distribution. The set of neighboring points is
used to define the margin between clusters and the overall distribution margin.
The proposed compactness and separability indices are applied to identify the
true number of clusters. Using a number of synthetic and real-world data sets,
we demonstrate the performance of these new indices and compare them with other
widely-used cluster validity indices.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于单细胞扰动建模的多阶段强化学习算法，通过自然梯度更新和PPO优化，显著改善了单细胞测序数据的扰动预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法在细胞命运决策的Waddington景观中容易陷入局部最优，导致轨迹陷入虚假谱系或不合理的分化结果，需要设计良好的初始化来逃逸局部最优并收敛到正确谱系。

Method: 采用多阶段强化学习：首先使用Fisher向量积和共轭梯度求解器计算显式自然梯度更新，通过KL信任域约束提供安全的曲率感知初始策略；然后应用带裁剪代理的近端策略优化(PPO)来细化策略。

Result: 该初始化方法在单细胞RNA测序(scRNA-seq)和单细胞ATAC测序(scATAC-seq)的扰动分析中显著改善了泛化性能。

Conclusion: 提出的多阶段强化学习算法通过精心设计的初始化有效解决了单细胞扰动建模中的局部最优问题，为细胞命运决策预测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a
central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven framework have
advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically
conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However,
these models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of
cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in
spurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable
gene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design
frameworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet,
an approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to
escape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this
work, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for
single-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural
gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver,
scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the
first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we
then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped
surrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We
demonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing
(scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.

TL;DR: DeepCausalMMM是一个结合深度学习、因果推断和营销科学的Python包，用于改进传统营销组合建模，能自动学习时间模式、渠道依赖关系和饱和效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统营销组合建模方法依赖线性回归或贝叶斯层次模型，假设营销渠道间独立且难以捕捉复杂时间动态和非线性饱和效应。

Method: 使用门控循环单元(GRU)自动学习时间模式(如广告存量效应和滞后)，通过有向无环图(DAG)学习营销渠道间的统计依赖和因果结构，并基于Hill方程实现饱和曲线建模。

Result: 实现了数据驱动的设计，支持多区域建模，包含鲁棒统计方法和全面的响应曲线分析，提供14+个交互式仪表板用于业务洞察。

Conclusion: DeepCausalMMM通过结合深度学习、因果推断和营销科学，解决了传统营销组合建模的局限性，提供了更准确和自动化的营销效果评估工具。

Abstract: Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical technique used to estimate the
impact of marketing activities on business outcomes such as sales, revenue, or
customer visits. Traditional MMM approaches often rely on linear regression or
Bayesian hierarchical models that assume independence between marketing
channels and struggle to capture complex temporal dynamics and non-linear
saturation effects [@Hanssens2005; @Ng2021Bayesian].
  DeepCausalMMM is a Python package that addresses these limitations by
combining deep learning, causal inference, and advanced marketing science. The
package uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to automatically learn temporal
patterns such as adstock (carryover effects) and lag, while simultaneously
learning statistical dependencies and potential causal structures between
marketing channels through Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning
[@Zheng2018NOTEARS; @Gong2024CausalMMM]. Additionally, it implements Hill
equation-based saturation curves to model diminishing returns and optimize
budget allocation.
  Key innovations include: (1) a data-driven design where hyperparameters and
transformations (e.g., adstock decay, saturation curves) are learned or
estimated from data with sensible defaults, rather than requiring fixed
heuristics or manual specification, (2) multi-region modeling with both shared
and region-specific parameters, (3) robust statistical methods including Huber
loss and advanced regularization, (4) comprehensive response curve analysis for
understanding channel saturation, and (5) an extensive visualization suite with
14+ interactive dashboards for business insights.

Motivation: 自动化超声波焊接检测面临训练数据有限和工业环境信号损坏的挑战，现有方法难以在真实工业环境中实现端到端检测。

Method: 使用基于Lamb波理论的降阶Helmholtz模型生成数据集，结合扩散模型处理分布外测量数据，采用U-Net进行分割和反演。

Result: 该集成框架为真实数据上的自动化焊接检测提供了端到端解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了焊接检测中的数据稀缺和环境噪声问题，实现了工业环境下的可靠检测。

Abstract: Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training
data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity
simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings
(resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end
machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e.,
industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the
challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow
consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution
alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order
Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive
dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively
inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion
models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set
of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD)
real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions,
i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution
representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed
by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end
solution for automated weld inspection on real data.

Motivation: 晶格场理论是计算物理的重要测试平台，但由于多模态性和长程相关性，采样其玻尔兹曼分布仍然具有挑战性。归一化流提供了一种有前景的替代方案，但在大晶格上的应用受到内存需求过高和模型表达能力不足的限制。

Method: 提出了稀疏三角传输映射框架，利用晶格图的条件独立结构，通过单调整流神经网络实现。该方法在精确稀疏性（尊重目标分布中的边际条件独立性）和近似稀疏性（无填充的计算可处理性）之间进行权衡。每个三角映射组件限制在局部过去，实现站点并行评估和线性时间复杂度。

Conclusion: 稀疏三角传输映射方法能够有效处理大晶格场理论的采样问题，在保持表达性、可逆结构的同时，实现线性时间复杂度和站点并行评估。

Abstract: Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics;
yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to
multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a
promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained
by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient
model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly
exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under
periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN).
We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that
navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting
marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and
\emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins).
Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise
parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while
preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two
dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings)
affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against
Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).

TL;DR: 提出一个假设宽松的框架，用于评估生存分析中条件平均治疗效果估计在面对删失偏差时的稳健性，通过部分识别方法推导CATE的边界，并开发具有双重稳健性和准oracle效率的元学习器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床研究中高达一半的患者因副作用或其他原因提前退出，当退出是信息性时（即依赖于生存时间），会引入删失偏差，导致治疗效果估计出现偏差。

Method: 使用部分识别方法推导条件平均治疗效果的边界，开发一种新颖的元学习器，可利用任意机器学习模型估计这些边界，并具有双重稳健性和准oracle效率的理论特性。

Result: 通过数值实验和癌症药物试验应用证明元学习器的实用价值，能够识别在信息性删失情况下治疗仍然有效的患者亚组。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估删失存在下治疗效果估计的稳健性提供了实用工具，促进了生存数据在医学和流行病学中证据生成的可靠使用。

Abstract: Dropout is common in clinical studies, with up to half of patients leaving
early due to side effects or other reasons. When dropout is informative (i.e.,
dependent on survival time), it introduces censoring bias, because of which
treatment effect estimates are also biased. In this paper, we propose an
assumption-lean framework to assess the robustness of conditional average
treatment effect (CATE) estimates in survival analysis when facing censoring
bias. Unlike existing works that rely on strong assumptions, such as
non-informative censoring, to obtain point estimation, we use partial
identification to derive informative bounds on the CATE. Thereby, our framework
helps to identify patient subgroups where treatment is effective despite
informative censoring. We further develop a novel meta-learner that estimates
the bounds using arbitrary machine learning models and with favorable
theoretical properties, including double robustness and quasi-oracle
efficiency. We demonstrate the practical value of our meta-learner through
numerical experiments and in an application to a cancer drug trial. Together,
our framework offers a practical tool for assessing the robustness of estimated
treatment effects in the presence of censoring and thus promotes the reliable
use of survival data for evidence generation in medicine and epidemiology.

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了推进理想化模型发展和加强建模社区间交流的重要性，为构建有效的物理辅助数字孪生和不确定性量化提供了计算高效框架。

Abstract: Computer models are indispensable tools for understanding the Earth system.
While high-resolution operational models have achieved many successes, they
exhibit persistent biases, particularly in simulating extreme events and
statistical distributions. In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate
fundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in
characterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different
models remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an
explainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model
hierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely
suited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting
bridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of
operational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through
targeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI
provides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box
correction to physically insightful understanding in a computationally
efficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and
uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly
correcting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Ni\~no spatiotemporal patterns,
leveraging statistically accurate idealized models. This work also highlights
the importance of pushing idealized model development and advancing
communication between modeling communities.

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，L2正则化ERM可以为核岭回归和逻辑回归提供良好校准的模型，无需增强或后处理重新校准。

Conclusion: 标准L2正则化ERM本身就能提供校准良好的模型，为理解训练过程如何影响模型校准提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Calibration of predicted probabilities is critical for reliable machine
learning, yet it is poorly understood how standard training procedures yield
well-calibrated models. This work provides the first theoretical proof that
canonical $L_{2}$-regularized empirical risk minimization directly controls the
smooth calibration error (smCE) without post-hoc correction or specialized
calibration-promoting regularizer. We establish finite-sample generalization
bounds for smCE based on optimization error, regularization strength, and the
Rademacher complexity. We then instantiate this theory for models in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, deriving concrete guarantees for kernel
ridge and logistic regression. Our experiments confirm these specific
guarantees, demonstrating that $L_{2}$-regularized ERM can provide a
well-calibrated model without boosting or post-hoc recalibration. The source
code to reproduce all experiments is available at

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical
in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces.
Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate
learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision
Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but
where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent
advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this
latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to
determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now
addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages
clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed
effectively speed up learning.
  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first
learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an
optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm
achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible
to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the
cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds
up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior
bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that
no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs.
This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic
optimality.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which predicts rainfall up to a few hours ahead, is
a critical tool for vulnerable communities in the Global South frequently
exposed to intense, rapidly developing storms. Timely forecasts provide a
crucial window to protect lives and livelihoods. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods suffer from high latency, low spatial and temporal
resolution, and significant gaps in accuracy across the world. Recent machine
learning-based nowcasting methods, common in the Global North, cannot be
extended to the Global South due to extremely sparse radar coverage. We present
Global MetNet, an operational global machine learning nowcasting model. It
leverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary
satellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12
hours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\deg}
(~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly
outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly
higher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than
previously available. Our model demonstrates better skill in data-sparse
regions than even the best high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US.
Validated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant
improvements across key metrics like the critical success index and fractions
skill score for all precipitation rates and lead times. Crucially, our model
generates forecasts in under a minute, making it readily deployable for
real-time applications. It is already deployed for millions of users on Google
Search. This work represents a key step in reducing global disparities in
forecast quality and integrating sparse, high-resolution satellite observations
into weather forecasting.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple
temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for
representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict
masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable
representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal
tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve
high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with
high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM)
centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i)
multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural
spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for
high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware
loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG
compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency
bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results
demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms
existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ
tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose
brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and
multimodal biosignal integration.

Motivation: 探索掩码扩散模型的计算能力和并行性限制，将其与现有的推理框架（CoT和PLTs）联系起来，以理解其理论能力和效率。

Method: 通过理论分析，在有限精度对数宽度设置下，建立MDMs与PLTs的等价性，并比较MDMs与CoT变换器在解决各类问题时的效率。

Result: MDMs与多项式填充PLTs等价，能解决所有CoT变换器可解的问题，且在正则语言等问题上，MDMs的并行生成使其推理速度显著更快。

Conclusion: 掩码扩散模型不仅具备与现有推理框架相当的计算能力，还在某些问题类上展现出更高的效率，证明了并行生成在推理任务中的优势。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to
traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them
efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to
their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what
types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do
this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of
thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision
log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact,
equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that
CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems
(including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than
CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster
reasoning.

Result: 实验验证CoDa-FL相比现有基准方法实现了更快的收敛速度、更低的通信和计算成本，以及在异构MEC设置下更高的学习精度

Conclusion: CoDa-FL框架通过聚类导向和依赖感知的方法，在联邦学习中有效降低了总完成时间，提高了系统效率

Abstract: We study the client selection problem in Federated Learning (FL) within
mobile edge computing (MEC) environments, particularly under the dependent
multi-task settings, to reduce the total time required to complete various
learning tasks. We propose CoDa-FL, a Cluster-oriented and Dependency-aware
framework designed to reduce the total required time via cluster-based client
selection and dependent task assignment. Our approach considers Earth Mover's
Distance (EMD) for client clustering based on their local data distributions to
lower computational cost and improve communication efficiency. We derive a
direct and explicit relationship between intra-cluster EMD and the number of
training rounds required for convergence, thereby simplifying the otherwise
complex process of obtaining the optimal solution. Additionally, we incorporate
a directed acyclic graph-based task scheduling mechanism to effectively manage
task dependencies. Through numerical experiments, we validate that our proposed
CoDa-FL outperforms existing benchmarks by achieving faster convergence, lower
communication and computational costs, and higher learning accuracy under
heterogeneous MEC settings.

Conclusion: 理论在神经ODE分类和流匹配中得到验证，观察到预测速率、正则化效果以及有利的运行时间和内存特性。

Abstract: We study dropout regularization in continuous-time models through the lens of
random-batch methods -- a family of stochastic sampling schemes originally
devised to reduce the computational cost of interacting particle systems. We
construct an unbiased, well-posed estimator that mimics dropout by sampling
neuron batches over time intervals of length $h$. Trajectory-wise convergence
is established with linear rate in $h$ for the expected uniform error. At the
distribution level, we establish stability for the associated continuity
equation, with total-variation error of order $h^{1/2}$ under mild moment
assumptions. During training with fixed batch sampling across epochs, a
Pontryagin-based adjoint analysis bounds deviations in the optimal cost and
control, as well as in gradient-descent iterates. On the design side, we
compare convergence rates for canonical batch sampling schemes, recover
standard Bernoulli dropout as a special case, and derive a cost--accuracy
trade-off yielding a closed-form optimal $h$. We then specialize to a
single-layer neural ODE and validate the theory on classification and flow
matching, observing the predicted rates, regularization effects, and favorable
runtime and memory profiles.

TL;DR: 提出了一种准动态程序表示框架，通过建模程序的优化敏感性来生成程序行为谱，使用产品量化和多任务Transformer模型学习行为代码的上下文语法，在编译器优化任务中优于静态基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有程序表示方法存在两难：静态表示高效但无法洞察程序在代码变换下的行为变化，动态表示能提供性能洞察但开销大且非确定性。需要超越这种权衡。

Method: 提出准动态框架，通过用多样化优化序列探测程序IR并量化静态特征变化来生成程序行为谱。使用产品量化将连续反应向量离散化为结构化子词，然后用多任务Transformer模型PQ-BERT预训练学习行为代码的上下文语法。

Result: 在两个代表性编译器优化任务（最佳通道预测和-Oz效益预测）上的综合实验表明，该方法优于最先进的静态基线方法。

Conclusion: 准动态程序表示框架成功超越了静态和动态表示之间的权衡，通过建模优化敏感性提供了既高效又富有洞察力的程序表示。

Abstract: Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a
fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance
compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static
representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR),
are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program
will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic
representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights
into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks
due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends
this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program
representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization
sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation
generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization
sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To
effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a
compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize
the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words.
Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to
learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive
experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass
Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/PREP/.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建高效实用的完全等变GNN提供了理论基础和实现方法，在保持强大实用效能的同时大幅降低计算需求。

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant
success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the
universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the
network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among
different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented
body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high
computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we
present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete
equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete
equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete
scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and
2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an
efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two
common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model
demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few
layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining
strong practical efficacy.

Motivation: 跨模态知识蒸馏技术虽然应用广泛，但缺乏理论指导，导致效果不稳定。需要建立理论框架来理解其有效性条件。

Method: 在联合高斯模型中理论验证CCH假设，并在图像、文本、视频、音频和癌症组学等多模态数据集上进行实证验证。

Result: 理论和实证研究都证实了CCH假设的有效性，为跨模态知识蒸馏提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 建立了跨模态知识蒸馏的理论框架，并基于CCH准则提供了选择最优教师模态的实用指南。

Abstract: The rapid increase in multimodal data availability has sparked significant
interest in cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, where richer
"teacher" modalities transfer information to weaker "student" modalities during
model training to improve performance. However, despite successes across
various applications, cross-modal KD does not always result in improved
outcomes, primarily due to a limited theoretical understanding that could
inform practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Cross-modal
Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): we propose that cross-modal KD is effective
when the mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds
the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. We
theoretically validate the CCH in a joint Gaussian model and further confirm it
empirically across diverse multimodal datasets, including image, text, video,
audio, and cancer-related omics data. Our study establishes a novel theoretical
framework for understanding cross-modal KD and offers practical guidelines
based on the CCH criterion to select optimal teacher modalities for improving
the performance of weaker modalities.

TL;DR: CleverCatch是一个知识引导的弱监督模型，通过将结构化领域知识整合到神经网络架构中，在共享嵌入空间中对齐规则和数据样本，从而改进医疗欺诈检测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗欺诈检测面临标注数据有限、欺诈手段不断演变和医疗记录高维度的挑战。传统监督方法受限于极端标签稀缺，而纯无监督方法往往无法捕捉临床意义上的异常。

Method: 通过联合训练编码器在代表合规和违规的合成数据上，学习软规则嵌入，将数据驱动学习与领域知识约束相结合，弥合专家启发式方法与机器学习之间的差距。

Result: 在大型真实数据集上的实验表明，CleverCatch优于四种最先进的异常检测基线方法，AUC平均提高1.3%，召回率平均提高3.4%。

Conclusion: 将专家规则嵌入学习过程不仅能提高检测准确性，还能增加透明度，为医疗欺诈检测等高风险领域提供可解释的方法。

Abstract: Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited
availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high
dimensionality of medical records. Traditional supervised methods are
challenged by extreme label scarcity, while purely unsupervised approaches
often fail to capture clinically meaningful anomalies. In this work, we
introduce CleverCatch, a knowledge-guided weak supervision model designed to
detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and
interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a
neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared
embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing
both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that
generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables
data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging
the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the
large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four
state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of
1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the
complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the
framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning
process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency,
offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare
fraud detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较Ising({-1,+1})和QUBO({0,1})编码在玻尔兹曼机学习中的表现，发现QUBO编码导致Fisher信息矩阵条件数较差，使随机梯度下降收敛更慢，而自然梯度下降对两种编码表现相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同变量编码（Ising vs QUBO）如何影响玻尔兹曼机的学习动态和信息几何特性，为实际训练提供编码选择指导。

Method: 在固定模型、采样器和步长的控制协议下，利用Fisher信息矩阵等于充分统计量协方差的特性，可视化模型样本的经验矩，分析两种编码的差异。

Result: QUBO编码在一阶和二阶统计量之间产生更大的交叉项，导致Fisher信息矩阵出现更多小特征值方向，降低谱熵，使随机梯度下降收敛更慢。自然梯度下降由于重参数化不变性，在两种编码下收敛相似。

Conclusion: 对于基于SGD的训练，Ising编码提供更各向同性的曲率和更快收敛；对于QUBO，中心化/缩放或NGD式预处理可缓解曲率问题。这些结果为变量编码和预处理提供了实用指导。

Abstract: We compare Ising ({-1,+1}) and QUBO ({0,1}) encodings for Boltzmann machine
learning under a controlled protocol that fixes the model, sampler, and step
size. Exploiting the identity that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) equals
the covariance of sufficient statistics, we visualize empirical moments from
model samples and reveal systematic, representation-dependent differences. QUBO
induces larger cross terms between first- and second-order statistics, creating
more small-eigenvalue directions in the FIM and lowering spectral entropy. This
ill-conditioning explains slower convergence under stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). In contrast, natural gradient descent (NGD)-which rescales updates by
the FIM metric-achieves similar convergence across encodings due to
reparameterization invariance. Practically, for SGD-based training, the Ising
encoding provides more isotropic curvature and faster convergence; for QUBO,
centering/scaling or NGD-style preconditioning mitigates curvature pathologies.
These results clarify how representation shapes information geometry and
finite-time learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines and yield actionable
guidelines for variable encoding and preprocessing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于截断影响函数(TIF)的偏好数据质量评估方法，发现数据质量是模型相关的，并开发了两种简化的评分函数来改进偏好数据选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常使用外部奖励模型或现成LLM来预处理原始训练数据集以识别有价值的偏好对，但很少检查单个数据点是否真正有益。需要改进偏好数据选择方法以适应特定模型。

Method: 提出截断影响函数(TIF)来评估数据质量，并引入两种计算更简单的评分函数(SF)，这些函数与TIF正相关且模型相关。通过组合这些SF来抵消不同的误差源，形成一个简单有效的数据选择规则。

Result: 在多样化对齐基准和各种LLM家族上的实验表明，使用更少的数据可以实现更好的对齐性能，证明了研究结果和新方法的通用性。

Conclusion: 偏好数据质量是模型相关的属性，通过模型相关的数据选择方法可以更精确地选择有价值的偏好数据，从而提高对齐性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment is typically achieved through learning
from human preference comparisons, making the quality of preference data
critical to its success. Existing studies often pre-process raw training
datasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or
off-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining
whether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data
quality through individual influence on validation data using our newly
proposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring
present in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is
inherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits
one model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data
selection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we
introduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally
simpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model
dependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for
preference data selection. Furthermore, we observe that these SFs inherently
exhibit errors when compared to TIF. To this end, we combine them to offset
their diverse error sources, resulting in a simple yet effective data selection
rule that enables the models to achieve a more precise selection of valuable
preference data. We conduct experiments across diverse alignment benchmarks and
various LLM families, with results demonstrating that better alignment
performance can be achieved using less data, showing the generality of our
findings and new methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在领域适应中表现不佳，主要原因是传统方法未能区分处理全局和局部模式，导致多层GNN后局部细节被破坏。通过谱分析发现，低频组件编码领域不变的全局模式，高频组件捕获领域特定的局部细节。

Method: FracNet包含两个协同模块：将原始图分解为高低频组件，执行频率感知的领域适应；结合对比学习框架改善领域适应的模糊边界问题。

Result: 大量实验表明，FracNet相比最先进方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: FracNet通过频率分解和对比学习有效解决了图神经网络的领域适应问题，理论证明和实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant
structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable
patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do
not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details
in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that
domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where
low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and
high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we
propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware
\underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two
synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and
low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover,
the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating
with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we
also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of
FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 解决现实世界中多模态数据异构性问题，现有联邦学习框架在非理想设置下效果有限，无法处理客户端间模态和样本分布不均的情况。

Conclusion: BlendFL在处理多模态数据异构性方面具有巨大潜力，特别适用于医疗和金融等需要数据隐私保护的现实场景。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of collaborative machine learning, without data
sharing, is multimodal data heterogeneity in real-world settings. While
Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across multiple clients,
existing frameworks, such as horizontal and vertical FL, are only effective in
`ideal' settings that meet specific assumptions. Hence, they struggle to
address scenarios where neither all modalities nor all samples are represented
across the participating clients. To address this gap, we propose BlendFL, a
novel FL framework that seamlessly blends the principles of horizontal and
vertical FL in a synchronized and non-restrictive fashion despite the asymmetry
across clients. Specifically, any client within BlendFL can benefit from either
of the approaches, or both simultaneously, according to its available dataset.
In addition, BlendFL features a decentralized inference mechanism, empowering
clients to run collaboratively trained local models using available local data,
thereby reducing latency and reliance on central servers for inference. We also
introduce BlendAvg, an adaptive global model aggregation strategy that
prioritizes collaborative model updates based on each client's performance. We
trained and evaluated BlendFL and other state-of-the-art baselines on three
classification tasks using a large-scale real-world multimodal medical dataset
and a popular multimodal benchmark. Our results highlight BlendFL's superior
performance for both multimodal and unimodal classification. Ablation studies
demonstrate BlendFL's faster convergence compared to traditional approaches,
accelerating collaborative learning. Overall, in our study we highlight the
potential of BlendFL for handling multimodal data heterogeneity for
collaborative learning in real-world settings where data privacy is crucial,
such as in healthcare and finance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定、手动调整的干预强度，常常导致干预不足或过度，需要更智能的干预策略。

Method: MERA通过优化干预方向和校准干预时机与强度，在无法自信修正时选择弃权，从而安全有效地纠正错误。

Result: 在多个数据集和语言模型家族上的实验表明，MERA能够安全有效地纠正错误且不降低性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MERA可作为通用高效的机制激活引导方法，并能与现有引导技术结合进一步提升性能。

Abstract: We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled
framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through
selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed,
manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering,
MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction,
and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving
performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments
across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective,
non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines.
Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further
enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient
approach to mechanistic activation steering.

learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP
assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client
distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this
by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail
to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated
Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims
for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP
leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to
approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw
data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that
reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through
federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP
achieves more adaptive prediction sets.

*Alessandro Brusaferri,Andrea Ballarino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合生成扩散模型和保形预测框架的方法，用于改进高分辨率气象场降尺度中的不确定性量化，确保有限样本下的边际有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成扩散模型在气象降尺度中虽然能提供高保真重建，但缺乏有限样本保证，导致网格点级不确定性估计不准确，影响其在业务应用中的可靠性。

Method: 在降尺度流程中引入保形预测框架，对扩散模型的样本进行后处理以推导条件分位数估计，并整合到保形化分位数回归过程中，获得具有局部自适应性的预测区间。

Result: 在意大利ERA5再分析数据上的实验表明，该方法显著改善了网格点级不确定性估计的覆盖率和概率评分稳定性。

Conclusion: 保形化生成模型为高分辨率气象场的概率降尺度提供了更可信赖的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological
fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical
applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling.
Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven
tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable
sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample
guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated
grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in
operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the
downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the
DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates,
incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting
locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The
proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled
to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with
markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM
baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for
more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological
fields.

Motivation: 解决现有无监督异常检测方法面临的分布假设冲突、计算效率低和处理不同类型异常困难等基本挑战。

Method: 构建集成表示，其中超球体半径编码密度信息：较小半径表示密集区域，较大半径对应稀疏区域。引入基于相似性的评分方法，通过比较集成表示与理论异常参考模式来衡量模式一致性。

Result: 在22个真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ISER优于11种基线方法。

Conclusion: ISER通过扩展基于隔离的方法，使用超球体半径作为局部密度特征代理，有效解决了现有异常检测方法的关键挑战，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in data mining and management with
applications spanning fraud detection, network security, and log monitoring.
Despite extensive research, existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods
still face fundamental challenges including conflicting distributional
assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different
anomaly types. To address these problems, we propose ISER (Isolation-based
Spherical Ensemble Representations) that extends existing isolation-based
methods by using hypersphere radii as proxies for local density characteristics
while maintaining linear time and constant space complexity. ISER constructs
ensemble representations where hypersphere radii encode density information:
smaller radii indicate dense regions while larger radii correspond to sparse
areas. We introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that measures
pattern consistency by comparing ensemble representations against a theoretical
anomaly reference pattern. Additionally, we enhance the performance of
Isolation Forest by using ISER and adapting the scoring function to address
axis-parallel bias and local anomaly detection limitations. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance
over 11 baseline methods.

Motivation: 随着机器学习在信息物理系统中的普及，需要从云端训练转向设备端处理(TinyML)，但超低功耗微控制器的有限计算资源使训练变得困难。

Method: 利用CPS由多个设备组成的特点，设计分布式学习方法，集成机器学习和无线通信，通过分布式训练专用计算高效分类器，结合定制的无线多跳通信协议。

Result: 在20个超低功耗设备的测试平台上，RockNet成功从零开始学习时间序列分类任务，精度比最新的神经网络微控制器训练方法提高最多2倍，分布式架构在扩展到20个设备时，每个设备的内存、延迟和能耗降低最多90%。

Conclusion: 分布式机器学习、分布式计算和通信的紧密集成首次实现了在超低功耗硬件上以最先进精度进行训练。

Abstract: As Machine Learning (ML) becomes integral to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS),
there is growing interest in shifting training from traditional cloud-based to
on-device processing (TinyML), for example, due to privacy and latency
concerns. However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose
limited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents
RockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault
or malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that
CPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that
integrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for
distributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need
minimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and
efficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes
the communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning.
Hardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate
RockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks
from scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network
microcontroller training by up to 2x. RockNet's distributed ML architecture
reduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90 % when
scaling from one central device to 20 devices. Our results show that a tight
integration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication
enables, for the first time, training on ultra-low-power hardware with
state-of-the-art accuracy.

TL;DR: 该论文研究在战略分类中引入弃权机制，证明最优弃权策略能确保决策者的效用不低于非弃权设置，并能抑制代理人的策略性操纵行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法决策系统容易受到代理人策略性操纵的影响，需要研究如何减少这种负面影响。

Method: 使用Stackelberg博弈模型，决策者首先宣布决策策略，然后策略性代理人操纵其特征以获得期望结果。

Result: 最优弃权策略确保决策者效用不劣于非弃权设置，弃权还能提高操纵成本，特别是对资质较差的代理人。

Conclusion: 弃权是减少算法决策系统中策略行为负面效应的有效工具。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision making is increasingly prevalent, but often vulnerable
to strategic manipulation by agents seeking a favorable outcome. Prior research
has shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a
decision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier
accuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification
context, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and
how principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a
Stackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces
its decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate
their features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary
classifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true
features, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility
(or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of
strategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can
also serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents,
especially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome
when manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior. These
results highlight abstention as a valuable tool for reducing the negative
effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化在大型非结构化离散空间中因缺乏梯度而难以高效最大化采集函数，需要一种可扩展的替代方法。

Method: 基于Thompson采样的ToSFiT方法，直接参数化候选解产生最大奖励的概率，利用提示条件化大型语言模型的先验知识，并逐步调整它们逼近后验分布。

Result: 在FAQ响应优化、热稳定蛋白质搜索和量子电路设计三个任务中验证，在线微调显著提高了样本效率，对计算效率影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ToSFiT提供了一种在大型离散空间中高效进行贝叶斯优化的新方法，理论分析表明其遗憾界与传统Thompson采样相当。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered
by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the
absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson
sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by
directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum
reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the
prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and
incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a
novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that
matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals
the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of
maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we
validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally
stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online
fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的相似性度量方法——邻近核，能够直接在核特征空间中计算不完整数据之间的相似性，无需在原始空间中进行显式插补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理不完整数据时要么丢弃数据，要么进行插值预处理，导致信息丢失和相似性估计偏差。需要一种能够直接处理不完整数据的相似性度量方法。

Method: 使用数据依赖的分箱结合邻近分配，将数据投影到高维稀疏表示中；提出级联回退策略来估计缺失特征分布；在核特征空间中直接计算相似性。

Result: 在12个真实世界不完整数据集上的聚类任务中，该方法表现出优于现有方法的性能，同时保持线性时间复杂度。

Conclusion: 邻近核方法能够有效处理不完整数据，避免信息丢失和偏差，在保持计算效率的同时提供更好的相似性度量。

Abstract: Measuring similarity between incomplete data is a fundamental challenge in
web mining, recommendation systems, and user behavior analysis. Traditional
approaches either discard incomplete data or perform imputation as a
preprocessing step, leading to information loss and biased similarity
estimates. This paper presents the proximity kernel, a new similarity measure
that directly computes similarity between incomplete data in kernel feature
space without explicit imputation in the original space. The proposed method
introduces data-dependent binning combined with proximity assignment to project
data into a high-dimensional sparse representation that adapts to local density
variations. For missing value handling, we propose a cascading fallback
strategy to estimate missing feature distributions. We conduct clustering tasks
on the proposed kernel representation across 12 real world incomplete datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods while
maintaining linear time complexity. All the code are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Generalist框架，通过多个专门化基础学习器分别处理不同任务，然后参数插值形成全局学习器，缓解对抗训练中自然精度下降和跨攻击鲁棒性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练存在两个主要局限：自然精度显著下降，以及在不同范数约束攻击下的鲁棒性迁移能力差。现有方法通常只能在一个网络中解决其中一个问题。

Method: 将整体泛化目标分解为多个子任务，每个基础学习器专门处理一个目标。训练后期通过参数插值形成全局学习器，并定期将全局参数重新分配给基础学习器以防止优化轨迹偏离。

Result: 理论分析和大量实验表明，Generalist实现了更低的泛化误差，显著缓解了权衡问题，相比基线方法表现更好。

Conclusion: Generalist为开发完全鲁棒的分类器提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable
to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the
most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical
applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade
significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer
well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior
works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we
propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks,
each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated
objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the
later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a
knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global
parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories
from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist
and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist
achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off
problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist
provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the
future.

Motivation: 尽管Transformer在离线或基于模型的强化学习中表现出色，但在在线无模型强化学习中应用不足，主要因为其对训练设置和模型设计决策的敏感性。

Method: 研究了关键设计问题：如何条件化输入、在actor和critic之间共享组件，以及如何切片序列数据进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，提出的架构和训练策略能够在完全可观测和部分可观测任务中，以及在向量和图像设置下实现有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为在在线强化学习中应用Transformer提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Despite their effectiveness and popularity in offline or model-based
reinforcement learning (RL), transformers remain underexplored in online
model-free RL due to their sensitivity to training setups and model design
decisions such as how to structure the policy and value networks, share
components, or handle temporal information. In this paper, we show that
transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online
model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs,
share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for
training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies
enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks,
and in both vector- and image-based settings. These findings offer practical
guidance for applying transformers in online RL.

Conclusion: 验证了依赖建模与对比学习结合的有效性，为云服务异常检测提供了完整技术方案，在复杂环境中表现出强适应性和稳定性

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse
anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency
modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The
method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts
temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a
graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for
context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then
introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the
separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space.
Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain
representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term
fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and
temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across
multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically
evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity
perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC,
while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring
noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of
integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete
technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability in complex environments.

Abstract: Although both data availability and the demand for accurate forecasts are
increasing, collaboration between stakeholders is often constrained by data
ownership and competitive interests. In contrast to recent proposals within
cooperative game-theoretical frameworks, we place ourselves in a more general
framework, based on prediction markets. There, independent agents trade
forecasts of uncertain future events in exchange for rewards. We introduce and
analyse a prediction market that (i) accounts for the historical performance of
the agents, (ii) adapts to time-varying conditions, while (iii) permitting
agents to enter and exit the market at will. The proposed design employs robust
regression models to learn the optimal forecasts' combination whilst handling
missing submissions. Moreover, we introduce a pay-off allocation mechanism that
considers both in-sample and out-of-sample performance while satisfying several
desirable economic properties. Case-studies using simulated and real-world data
allow demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed market
design.

*Benjamin Kempinski,Tal Kachman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的方法来近似计算网络流博弈中的Banzhaf值，解决了传统方法在大规模系统中的计算瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于精确计算Banzhaf值在超过约20个代理时变得不可行，而蒙特卡洛采样方法样本复杂度高且无法在不同网络配置间迁移知识，因此需要开发可扩展的近似计算方法。

Method: 将问题构建为图级预测任务，使用图神经网络直接从网络拓扑和控制结构中学习代理影响力的通用模式。比较了三种最先进的GNN架构：图注意力网络(GAT)、带边特征的图同构网络(GINE)和EdgeConv。

Result: 训练后的GNN模型实现了高保真度的Banzhaf值近似，相比精确和基于采样的方法实现了数量级的速度提升。最重要的是，模型展现了强大的零样本泛化能力：在特定大小和拓扑的图上训练的模型能够准确预测具有不同结构属性的全新网络的Banzhaf值，无需重新训练。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了图神经网络作为复杂网络系统可扩展合作博弈论分析的实用工具。

Abstract: Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for
quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging
from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is
intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential
complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide
statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot
transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them
impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel
learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate
Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a
graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent
influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a
comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN
architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with
Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of
200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count
(5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained
GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with
order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most
significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on
graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for
entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring
retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable
cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.

Abstract: Enhancing scene understanding in adverse visibility conditions remains a
critical challenge for surveillance and autonomous navigation systems.
Conventional imaging modalities, such as RGB and thermal infrared (MWIR /
LWIR), when fused, often struggle to deliver comprehensive scene information,
particularly under conditions of atmospheric interference or inadequate
illumination. To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging
has emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric
disturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the
advancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face
significant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR
datasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to
synthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming
spectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast
enhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework
integrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized
encoder-decoder neural network architecture with modality-specific encoders and
a softmax-gated fusion head. Comprehensive experiments on public {RGB-LWIR
benchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real
RGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset} demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion
framework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural
fidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal
baselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of
U2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight
substantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and
autonomous systems.

TL;DR: AdaLog是一个轻量级自适应系统，通过消除特征级冗余数据和优化异构行为存储，显著减少移动应用中用户行为日志的存储成本，同时保持模型推理精度和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在移动应用中的普及，记录用户行为数据带来了巨大的存储成本，导致系统响应性降低和应用卸载率上升。现有工业实践中存在特征级冗余数据和稀疏存储的问题。

Method: AdaLog首先将特征级冗余数据消除建模为超图中的最大权重匹配问题，并提出分层算法；然后采用虚拟哈希属性设计将异构行为分布到少量日志文件中；最后设计增量更新机制以适应动态用户行为模式。

Result: 在真实用户数据上的评估显示，AdaLog将行为日志大小减少了19%到44%，系统开销极小（仅2秒延迟和15MB内存使用）。

Conclusion: AdaLog为更广泛采用设备端机器学习提供了更高效的数据基础，解决了移动应用中用户行为日志的存储瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into modern mobile
apps to enable personalized and intelligent services. These models typically
rely on rich input features derived from historical user behaviors to capture
user intents. However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording
necessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps,
leading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this
storage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system
designed to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded
mobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We
identify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user
behavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across
different features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing
behaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To
solve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level
redundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and
proposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,
AdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous
behaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to
ensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an
incremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting
outdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into
popular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner. Evaluations on
real-world user data show that AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44%
with minimal system overhead (only 2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage),
providing a more efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device
ML.

Conclusion: Procrustes后处理是一种简单有效的对齐方法，能够使嵌入模型具有互操作性，同时保持各自嵌入空间的几何特性。

Abstract: Embedding models trained separately on similar data often produce
representations that encode stable information but are not directly
interchangeable. This lack of interoperability raises challenges in several
practical applications, such as model retraining, partial model upgrades, and
multimodal search. Driven by these challenges, we study when two sets of
embeddings can be aligned by an orthogonal transformation. We show that if
pairwise dot products are approximately preserved, then there exists an
isometry that closely aligns the two sets, and we provide a tight bound on the
alignment error. This insight yields a simple alignment recipe, Procrustes
post-processing, that makes two embedding models interoperable while preserving
the geometry of each embedding space. Empirically, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in three applications: maintaining compatibility across
retrainings, combining different models for text retrieval, and improving
mixed-modality search, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个应用于肿瘤学的物理信息神经网络框架，通过将微分方程建模的动力学系统规律嵌入损失函数作为约束，来学习肿瘤微环境中联合疗法引起的时间变化相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在肿瘤学中，实验数据通常稀疏且仅包含少量时间点的肿瘤体积数据。通过嵌入从动力学系统先验信息导出的归纳偏置，可以扩展物理信息神经网络并整合观察到的生物约束作为正则化代理。

Method: 修改PINN算法，将生物约束作为正则化项，能够引导算法找到合理解并在少量训练样本下具有良好的泛化能力。通过间歇性治疗的常微分方程模型来演示该方法。

Result: 该算法能够求解ODE并获得ODE模型中某些参数的时间变化形式。使用均方误差、平均绝对误差和平均绝对百分比误差等指标展示了强收敛性。

Conclusion: 改进的PINN框架能够在稀疏数据条件下有效学习肿瘤治疗动力学，为肿瘤学中的组合疗法建模提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that embed the
laws of dynamical systems modeled by differential equations into their loss
function as constraints. In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to
oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination
therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often
sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding
inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we
extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed
biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is
able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only
a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning
the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution
to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We
demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error
(MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的模糊回归方法，结合了Mamdani系统的可解释性和TSK模型的精确性，通过混合规则结构和双重优势类型来平衡准确性和可解释性。


<details>

Motivation: 传统回归方法难以处理现实世界数据中的不确定性和模糊性，而深度学习缺乏可解释性且容易在小数据集上过拟合。模糊系统虽然能处理不确定性，但Mamdani和TSK系统在可解释性和准确性之间存在权衡。

Method: 提出混合模糊回归方法，结合Mamdani系统的可解释性和TSK模型的精确性，采用包含模糊和清晰组件的混合规则结构以及双重优势类型。

Result: 在6个基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法在4个数据集中获得最佳模糊方法分数，在2个数据集中优于不透明模型，在1个数据集中获得最佳总体分数，RMSE改进范围从0.4%到19%。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法为预测建模提供了一个平衡且多功能的工具，解决了模糊系统中可解释性和准确性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Regression analysis is employed to examine and quantify the relationships
between input variables and a dependent and continuous output variable. It is
widely used for predictive modelling in fields such as finance, healthcare, and
engineering. However, traditional methods often struggle with real-world data
complexities, including uncertainty and ambiguity. While deep learning
approaches excel at capturing complex non-linear relationships, they lack
interpretability and risk over-fitting on small datasets. Fuzzy systems provide
an alternative framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision, with Mamdani
and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) systems offering complementary strengths:
interpretability versus accuracy. This paper presents a novel fuzzy regression
method that combines the interpretability of Mamdani systems with the precision
of TSK models. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid rule structure with
fuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types, enhancing both accuracy
and explainability. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a
component similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision
through improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and
versatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between
interpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets
tested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4
datasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best
overall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to
19%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督的低秩方法来校正停车场GPS点的误差，并基于停车位与道路平行的物理约束将其对齐到实际位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高层建筑会导致GPS点偏离停车位的实际位置，且低成本GPS设备本身存在定位误差，需要从大量停车位中无监督地校正少数错误的GPS点。

Method: 利用停车位与道路平行的物理约束，提出无监督低秩方法，在统一框架中同时进行GPS点误差校正和对齐。

Result: 广泛实验证明该方法能有效解决实际问题，对任何类型的GPS点误差都简单有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为停车管理、停车政策和城市发展等应用提供了准确的停车位GPS定位数据。

Abstract: Parking spots are essential components, providing vital mobile resources for
residents in a city. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking
spots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management,
parking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to
cause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides,
the standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error.
Therefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a
large number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper,
motivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are
parallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to
effectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking
spots in a unified framework. The proposed unconventional rectification and
alignment method is simple and yet effective for any type of GPS point errors.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to
solve a practical problem. The data set and the code are publicly accessible

<details>

Motivation: 验证多项式非负性是NP难问题，传统SOS方法需要求解SDP，其维度随单项式基规模平方增长，计算成本高昂

Method: 训练Transformer模型预测近似最小单项式基，包含三个关键组件：高效生成1亿多个SOS多项式训练数据、Transformer架构设计与训练、理论分析的系统回退机制

Result: 在200多个基准数据集上验证，相比最先进求解器实现100倍以上加速，能够解决竞争方法失败的实例

Conclusion: 该方法为SOS编程的实际可扩展性提供了新的见解和突破

Abstract: Certifying nonnegativity of polynomials is a well-known NP-hard problem with
direct applications spanning non-convex optimization, control, robotics, and
beyond. A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS)
property, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In
practice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally
expensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose
dimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS
expression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis
have been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented
algorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer
model that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,
thereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall
methodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset
generation of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the
corresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to
ensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our
approach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\times$
compared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances
where competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards
transforming the practical scalability of SOS programming.

Motivation: 平均收益最优性在MDP中过于渐近，需要结合即时损失度量来考虑偏差最优性层次结构，但识别这类最优策略的方法尚不完善。

Method: 为每个最优性阶构建了学习算法，具有渐近消失的错误概率；确定了可以有限时间停止识别的MDP类别；提供了可处理的停止规则。

Result: 证明了当MDP具有唯一Bellman最优策略时，识别算法可以在有限时间内停止，且该类别不依赖于所考虑的最优性阶。

Conclusion: 本文提供了系统的方法来识别偏差最优性层次结构中的策略，并给出了有限时间停止的充分条件和实用停止规则。

Abstract: Although average gain optimality is a commonly adopted performance measure in
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), it is often too asymptotic. Further
incorporating measures of immediate losses leads to the hierarchy of bias
optimalities, all the way up to Blackwell optimality. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of identifying policies of such optimality orders. To
that end, for each order, we construct a learning algorithm with vanishing
probability of error. Furthermore, we characterize the class of MDPs for which
identification algorithms can stop in finite time. That class corresponds to
the MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy, and does not depend on the
optimality order considered. Lastly, we provide a tractable stopping rule that
when coupled to our learning algorithm triggers in finite time whenever it is
possible to do so.

Motivation: 现有癫痫检测方法仅使用单模态EEG信号，忽略了多模态信息的潜在优势。

Method: 基于CLIP框架，使用Conformer架构的EEG编码器和可学习BERT作为文本编码器，在共享潜在空间进行跨模态表示学习，并引入知识蒸馏训练轻量学生模型。

Result: 在TUSZ、AUBMC和CHB-MIT数据集上，师生模型准确率均超97%，F1分数均高于0.94，学生模型参数量和大小约为教师模型的58.1%。

Conclusion: 该模型在EEG癫痫检测中具有潜力，为资源受限环境部署轻量模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief
episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical
discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep
learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,
neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,
we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP
framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture
comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder
based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable
BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared
latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance
efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where
the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student
model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT
datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding
97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94,
demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework.
Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately
58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity
and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results
highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection
and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in
resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used
objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$
local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human
preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the
principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under
single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a
matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.
  In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the
problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm
and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log
(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time
step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space
$\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF.
As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for
online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the
offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source
code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.

Motivation: 移动设备部署LLMs时使用LoRA适配器支持多样化下游任务，但存储容量有限。现有模型合并技术无法有效处理LoRA增量交付的场景，需要在线持续合并新LoRA同时保持已有任务性能。

Method: 提出数据无关且计算高效的策略，在新LoRA可用时选择和合并适配器，设备仅能存储有限数量的适配器。

Result: 在真实世界任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在遵守设备存储预算和计算限制的同时，相比替代策略具有优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了设备上在线持续合并LoRA的挑战，为资源受限环境下的增量任务部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages
Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight
resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile
devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple
LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered
incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem
types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online
continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while
preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we
propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and
merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store
only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world
tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative
strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of
on-device settings.

Motivation: 传统主题模型在医学文本上表现不佳，特别是当某些医学主题的文档数量较少时。需要开发能够在低数据场景下有效工作的主题建模方法。

Method: 使用原型网络构建主题模型，通过计算输入数据点与原型表示之间的距离来进行预测，这种方法在少样本学习场景中特别有效。

Result: 与文献中使用的两种基线主题模型相比，ProtoTopic在主题连贯性和多样性方面都有显著提升，能够在有限数据下生成医学相关主题。

Conclusion: 原型网络为基础的主题模型在医学文本分析中具有优势，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下，能够生成质量更高的主题。

Abstract: Topic modeling is a useful tool for analyzing large corpora of written
documents, particularly academic papers. Despite a wide variety of proposed
topic modeling techniques, these techniques do not perform well when applied to
medical texts. This can be due to the low number of documents available for
some topics in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we propose ProtoTopic, a
prototypical network-based topic model used for topic generation for a set of
medical paper abstracts. Prototypical networks are efficient, explainable
models that make predictions by computing distances between input datapoints
and a set of prototype representations, making them particularly effective in
low-data or few-shot learning scenarios. With ProtoTopic, we demonstrate
improved topic coherence and diversity compared to two topic modeling baselines
used in the literature, demonstrating the ability of our model to generate
medically relevant topics even with limited data.

Conclusion: 成功将单目标在线凸优化扩展到多目标场景，提出的简单算法在i.i.d.设置下实现了最优的遗憾界，为多目标在线学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In online convex optimization (OCO), a single loss function sequence is
revealed over a time horizon of $T$, and an online algorithm has to choose its
action at time $t$, before the loss function at time $t$ is revealed. The goal
of the online algorithm is to incur minimal penalty (called $\textit{regret}$
compared to a static optimal action made by an optimal offline algorithm
knowing all functions of the sequence in advance.
  In this paper, we broaden the horizon of OCO, and consider multi-objective
OCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has
to choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are
revealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences,
we consider the $\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline
algorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the
maximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the
$K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time
slots, and its {\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its
$\textit{min-max}$ cost and that of the benchmark. The $\textit{min-max}$
regret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret
needs to `track' all loss function sequences closely at all times.
  We consider this $\textit{min-max}$ regret in the i.i.d. input setting where
all loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution. For the
i.i.d. model we propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known
$\textit{Hedge}$ and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably
simple proof that its expected $\textit{min-max}$ regret is $O(\sqrt{T \log
K})$.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables models to learn new tasks across

DOLFIN, a novel approach combining Vision Transformers with low-rank adapters

Our method leverages LoRA for minimal communication overhead and incorporates

Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试结果对模型信任、选择和部署具有重要影响，但这些评估容易受到语义等效对抗扰动的影响。现有研究主要关注影响所有模型的通用攻击，而本文探索能否选择性地影响特定模型性能而不显著影响其他模型。

Method: 在MMLU基准上，使用TextAttack框架中的标准攻击方法，开发了选择性评估协议、定制约束条件以提高攻击选择性，并提出了基于代理LLM的管道来生成选择性扰动。

Result: 实证研究发现选择性对抗攻击确实存在，能够显著改变模型相对排名，这表明基准测试的公平性、可重复性和透明度面临挑战。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LLM评估中需要采用扰动感知的报告和鲁棒性诊断，证明即使是微小的编辑也能改变比较判断，呼吁改进基准测试方法以确保评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Benchmarking outcomes increasingly govern trust, selection, and deployment of
LLMs, yet these evaluations remain vulnerable to semantically equivalent
adversarial perturbations. Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has
emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the
question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance
performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem
and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark
designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning
ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into
TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment,
develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a
surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we
find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative
rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of
leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware
reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that
even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在先进工艺节点中，功耗、性能和面积优化变得复杂且具有挑战性。机器学习和设计技术协同优化面临训练数据缺乏和设计流程周转时间长的限制。

Method: 提出ArtNet人工网表生成器，复制关键拓扑特征，生成与目标参数匹配的现实人工数据集。

Result: 在CNN基DRV预测中，ArtNet数据增强使F1分数提高0.16；在DTCO中，ArtNet生成的mini-brains与目标全规模块设计的PPA匹配度达97.94%。

Conclusion: ArtNet能够有效解决训练数据不足问题，提升机器学习模型性能，并支持更高效的PPA优化和设计空间探索。

Abstract: In advanced nodes, optimization of power, performance and area (PPA) has
become highly complex and challenging. Machine learning (ML) and
design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) provide promising mitigations, but
face limitations due to a lack of diverse training data as well as long design
flow turnaround times (TAT). We propose ArtNet, a novel artificial netlist
generator designed to tackle these issues. Unlike previous methods, ArtNet
replicates key topological characteristics, enhancing ML model generalization
and supporting broader design space exploration for DTCO. By producing
realistic artificial datasets that moreclosely match given target parameters,
ArtNet enables more efficient PPAoptimization and exploration of flows and
design enablements. In the context of CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data
augmentationimproves F1 score by 0.16 compared to using only the original
(real) dataset. In the DTCO context, ArtNet-generated mini-brains achieve a PPA
match up to 97.94%, demonstrating close alignment with design metrics of
targeted full-scale block designs.

*Chen Wang,Yansen Wang,Dongqi Han,Zilong Wang,Dongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了EEGChaT，一种基于Transformer的通道选择模块，用于自动识别SEEG记录中最相关的通道，显著提升解码准确性并增强可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEEG信号分析面临输入通道数量大且相关性异质性的挑战，传统通道选择方法难以扩展且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 引入通道聚合令牌(CATs)跨通道聚合信息，利用改进的Attention Rollout技术计算可解释的通道重要性分数。

Result: 在DuIN数据集上评估，EEGChaT与现有分类模型集成可将解码准确率提升高达17%，且通道权重与人工选择通道有显著重叠。

Conclusion: EEGChaT是高维SEEG分析中有效且可泛化的通道选择解决方案，既提升性能又提供神经信号相关性的洞察。

Abstract: Analyzing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals is critical for
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and neuroscience research, yet
poses significant challenges due to the large number of input channels and
their heterogeneous relevance. Traditional channel selection methods struggle
to scale or provide meaningful interpretability for SEEG data. In this work, we
propose EEGChaT, a novel Transformer-based channel selection module designed to
automatically identify the most task-relevant channels in SEEG recordings.
EEGChaT introduces Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to aggregate information
across channels, and leverages an improved Attention Rollout technique to
compute interpretable, quantitative channel importance scores. We evaluate
EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with
existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy,
achieving up to 17\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced
by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting
the interpretability of the approach. Our results suggest that EEGChaT is an
effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional
SEEG analysis, offering both enhanced performance and insights into neural
signal relevance.

Conclusion: 物理增强的多任务高斯过程框架能够有效建模复杂时空动态系统，通过结合几何感知和物理约束显著提升模型保真度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in sensing and imaging technologies have enabled the
collection of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data across complex geometric
domains. However, effective modeling of such data remains challenging due to
irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly
predict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a
physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for
spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware,
multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the
model fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a
physics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be
consistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP
framework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over
existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical
constraints and geometric prior.

Result: 该方法能够快速完成客户端贡献的清除，减少模型不可用的时间。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案满足了联邦学习中数据清除的时效性要求，解决了现有方法导致的模型服务中断问题。

Abstract: Nowdays, there are an abundance of portable devices capable of collecting
large amounts of data and with decent computational power. This opened the
possibility to train AI models in a distributed manner, preserving the
participating clients' privacy. However, because of privacy regulations and
safety requirements, elimination upon necessity of a client contribution to the
model has become mandatory. The cleansing process must satisfy specific
efficacy and time requirements. In recent years, research efforts have produced
several knowledge removal methods, but these require multiple communication
rounds between the data holders and the process coordinator. This can cause the
unavailability of an effective model up to the end of the removal process,
which can result in a disservice to the system users. In this paper, we
introduce an innovative solution based on Task Arithmetic and the Neural
Tangent Kernel, to rapidly remove a client's influence from a model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN架构在表达能力上有限，而更强大的架构往往计算成本过高，需要一种既高效又表达能力强的解决方案

Method: 基于Chiba和Nishizeki的经典三角形计数算法，在消息传递过程中显式利用三角形信息，开发EB-1WL测试和EB-GNN架构

Result: EB-1WL比1-WL表达能力显著更强，EB-GNN在保持近线性时间和内存效率的同时，性能优于简单MPNN，与专用GNN相当

Conclusion: EB-GNN提供了一个高效且表达能力强的通用GNN架构，在理论和实证上都表现出色

Abstract: We propose EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding
GNN architecture, EB-GNN. Our architecture is inspired by a classic triangle
counting algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki, and explicitly uses triangles during
message passing. We achieve the following results: (1)~EB-1WL is significantly
more expressive than 1-WL. Further, we provide a complete logical
characterization of EB-1WL based on first-order logic, and matching
distinguishability results based on homomorphism counting. (2)~In an important
distinction from previous proposals for more expressive GNN architectures,
EB-1WL and EB-GNN require near-linear time and memory on practical graph
learning tasks. (3)~Empirically, we show that EB-GNN is a highly-efficient
general-purpose architecture: It substantially outperforms simple MPNNs, and
remains competitive with task-specialized GNNs while being significantly more
computationally efficient.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个系统框架，为经典非线性降维方法构建神经解码器架构，首次实现双向映射，并在学习到的流形空间上实现基于扩散的生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典非线性降维技术（如t-SNE、Isomap、LLE）虽然擅长创建低维嵌入用于数据可视化，但缺乏将这些嵌入映射回原始高维空间的能力，这限制了它们在生成应用中的使用。

Method: 构建神经解码器架构用于主要NLDR方法，实现双向映射，并扩展该框架，在学习到的流形空间上实现基于扩散的生成过程。

Result: 在CelebA数据集上的实验表明，解码器能成功重建数据，但质量不如端到端优化的自编码器；流形约束的扩散产生低质量样本，表明经典NLDR嵌入的离散稀疏特性不适合生成模型所需的连续插值。

Conclusion: 这项研究突显了在主要为可视化和分析设计的NLDR方法上改造生成能力的内在挑战。

Abstract: Classical nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques like t-SNE,
Isomap, and LLE excel at creating low-dimensional embeddings for data
visualization but fundamentally lack the ability to map these embeddings back
to the original high-dimensional space. This one-way transformation limits
their use in generative applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by
introducing a system- atic framework for constructing neural decoder
architectures for prominent NLDR methods, enabling bidirectional mapping for
the first time. We extend this framework by implementing a diffusion-based
generative process that operates directly within these learned manifold spaces.
Through experiments on the CelebA dataset, we evaluate the reconstruction and
generative performance of our approach against autoencoder and standard
diffusion model baselines. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade- off: while
the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by
end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Moreover, manifold-constrained diffusion
yields poor-quality samples, suggesting that the discrete and sparse nature of
classical NLDR embeddings is ill-suited for the continuous inter- polation
required by generative models. This work highlights the inherent challenges in
retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for
visualization and analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于门的量子储层计算方法（MTS-QRC），用于多元时间序列预测，该方法针对当前量子设备的连接性和深度限制进行了优化，并在噪声环境中展现出良好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的量子储层计算研究主要针对单变量信号，且忽视了近期量子硬件的实际约束条件。

Method: 使用基于门的量子储层计算，配对注入和记忆量子比特，采用Trotter化的最近邻横向场Ising演化，针对当前设备连接性和深度进行优化。

Result: 在Lorenz-63和ENSO数据集上分别获得0.0087和0.0036的均方误差，性能与经典储层计算相当，在某些设置上优于学习型RNN。在IBM Heron R2设备上，MTS-QRC在真实深度下保持准确性，甚至在ENSO上优于无噪声模拟器。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持基于门的量子储层计算在NISQ硬件上进行多元时间序列预测的实用性，并激励系统研究硬件噪声何时以及如何有益于量子储层计算的读出。

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a hardware-friendly approach to
temporal learning, yet most studies target univariate signals and overlook
near-term hardware constraints. This work introduces a gate-based QRC for
multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and
uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized
for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method
achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively,
performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above
learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some
settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and,
interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value
analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature
directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this
regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS
forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how
hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着时间序列基础模型的发展，评估这些模型的零样本预测能力变得日益重要，但现有评估方法存在数据完整性、信息泄露和基准数据集代表性等问题，需要开发更稳健的评估方法。

Method: 通过调查现有TSFM评估实践，识别出数据分区混淆、基准数据集重叠、外部冲击影响等关键问题，并分析这些因素如何导致性能估计膨胀和知识错误转移。

Result: 研究发现现有评估方法存在广泛的数据分区混淆，可能导致性能估计过高，并揭示了信息泄露和全局模式记忆等风险，这些都会影响TSFM评估的完整性。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究社区开发稳健的评估方法，包括使用真正样本外数据进行评估，以防止在LLM和经典时间序列基准测试中已观察到的陷阱，确保TSFM评估的完整性。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time
series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the
need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large
Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive
training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of
benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights
multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark
datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information
leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global
patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our
findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking
inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to
local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation
methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time
series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new,
principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data,
to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.

Motivation: 类别不平衡问题导致分类器偏向多数类，现有方法仅使用多数类分布来近似少数类统计会产生过泛化问题。

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the insufficiency of data in certain
classes, which causes a classifier to be biased toward the majority class.
Distribution calibration is a technique that seeks to estimate a more accurate
class distribution based on an observed or estimated one. To address this
issue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with
Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced
Classification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority
classes using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components
from both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is
trained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent
disentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are
used to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration
strategy. This approach effectively mitigates the overgeneralization problem
that arises when only the distribution of the majority class is used to
approximate the minority class statistics. Instead, our method calibrates the
parameters by leveraging the distribution of data points in neighboring
regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior classification performance compared to several baseline and
state-of-the-art techniques across a diverse range of image, text, and tabular
datasets.

Conclusion: XNN架构有效解决了物理数据中维度变化的问题，为PDE基础模型提供了维度无关的解决方案，证明了多维预训练的关键价值。

Abstract: The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced
general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot
inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics
data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a
unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems.
Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate
encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To
address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the
Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as
Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor
dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE
foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance
across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple
PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform
competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to
unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining
for foundation models.

Motivation: 对角预条件器作为二阶优化器的近似计算可行方法，在深度学习训练中显示出加速潜力。需要比较基于Adam和Gauss-Newton的两种主流方法，了解它们在基选择和梯度噪声影响下的表现差异。

Method: 在二次目标和逻辑回归上分析优化器，考虑所有四个象限的情况。通过理论分析和实证研究比较Adam与GN^{-1}、GN^{-1/2}在不同设置下的性能。

Result: 无论基选择如何，在全批量设置下存在Adam优于GN^{-1}和GN^{-1/2}的情况。在随机设置下，对于高斯数据假设的线性回归，Adam与GN^{-1/2}行为相似。理论结果在凸和非凸目标上得到实证支持。

Conclusion: Adam和Gauss-Newton对角预条件方法在不同设置下各有优势，基选择和梯度噪声是影响性能的关键因素，需要根据具体场景选择合适的优化方法。

Abstract: Diagonal preconditioners are computationally feasible approximate to
second-order optimizers, which have shown significant promise in accelerating
training of deep learning models. Two predominant approaches are based on Adam
and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current
gradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter
uses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the
recent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.
  In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through
the lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the
impact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these
optimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four
quadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where
Adam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings.
Conversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for
linear regression under a Gaussian data assumption. These theoretical results
are supported by empirical studies on both convex and non-convex objectives.

Conclusion: 提出的方法共同推进了RLHF技术状态，通过信息理论框架和分布级正则化有效解决了奖励过拟合问题。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
aligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward
over-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to
its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward
models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of
suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level
constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we
propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant
information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that
reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent
space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution.
Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that
penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape
while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to
the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present
Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying
reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online
mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs
and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of
InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively
advancing the state of RLHF.

Conclusion: 单纯形嵌入是一种有效的表示学习方法，能显著提升强化学习算法的性能而不损失运行速度。

Abstract: Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of
actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization;
unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment
interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that
well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample
efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of
simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain
embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in
sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen
policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial
embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across
a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in
runtime speed.

Conclusion: 结合FW算法的收敛保证，该方法能为原始组合问题提供近似最优解，为LLM剪枝提供了理论支撑的有效方法。

Abstract: Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements
of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model
to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the
per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full
retraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However,
finding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it
to optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics
that ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we
instead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and
solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method
drastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines
on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide
theoretical justification by showing that, combined with the convergence
guarantees of the FW algorithm, we obtain an approximate solution to the
original combinatorial problem upon rounding the relaxed solution to

TL;DR: 该论文评估了深度学习模型在千米尺度天气数据降尺度任务中的表现，发现现有模型在地理泛化和物理一致性方面存在不足，并提出使用功率谱密度损失函数来改进模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 千米尺度天气数据对实际应用至关重要，但传统天气模拟计算成本高。深度学习模型提供了更快的替代方案，但其可靠性仍受质疑，因为评估通常使用标准机器学习指标而非基于大气物理学的洞察。

Method: 对最先进的深度学习模型进行基准测试，引入基于物理学的诊断方法来评估性能，特别关注地理泛化和物理一致性。提出了使用功率谱密度损失函数来改进模型。

Result: 实验表明，即使像CorrDiff这样的模型在训练区域表现良好，但在泛化到其他地理区域（如伊比利亚、摩洛哥或斯堪的纳维亚）时表现不佳。模型还无法准确捕捉从预测速度场导出的二阶变量（如散度和涡度）。

Conclusion: 当前深度学习模型在天气降尺度任务中存在地理泛化和物理一致性方面的挑战。提出的功率谱密度损失函数能够经验性地改善地理泛化能力，通过重建小尺度物理结构来提高模型性能。

Abstract: Kilometer-scale weather data is crucial for real-world applications but
remains computationally intensive to produce using traditional weather
simulations. An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a
faster alternative for climate downscaling. However, their reliability is still
in question, as they are often evaluated using standard machine learning
metrics rather than insights from atmospheric and weather physics. This paper
benchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces
physics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability,
with a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency.
Our experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models
such as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g.,
central Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia,
Morocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail to accurately
capture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity derived from
predicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution
geographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent
predictions. We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral
density loss function that empirically improves geographic generalization by
encouraging the reconstruction of small-scale physical structures. The code for
reproducing the experimental results can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式多保真度代理模型，能够顺序整合不同类型的数据，通过双连接系统利用不同数据集之间的相关性，同时确保每个级别对前一级进行加法修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精度数据获取成本高且耗时，而低精度数据更容易获得但准确性不足。实际应用中数据可能来自不同模态且非同时可用，这给建模带来了挑战。

Method: 使用定制编码器顺序整合不同类型数据，通过神经网络进行多保真度回归。采用两种连接方式：编码输入之间的拼接连接和最终输出之间的加法连接。

Result: 在数值基准测试和实际案例研究中证明，该方法能可靠整合多模态数据并提供准确预测，在时间和参数变化下保持性能。

Conclusion: 该渐进式多保真度代理模型能有效利用多模态数据，防止性能退化，并自动适应可用输入进行预测。

Abstract: Highly accurate datasets from numerical or physical experiments are often
expensive and time-consuming to acquire, posing a significant challenge for
applications that require precise evaluations, potentially across multiple
scenarios and in real-time. Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate
models can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data.
Conversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and
encompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity
information, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in
practical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of
different modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating
the modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive
multi-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse
data types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded
inputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural
networks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity
levels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded
inputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection
system enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while
ensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level
without altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new
input data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions
based on the available inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
on numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing that it reliably
integrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions, maintaining
performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations.

Motivation: 现有机器学习PDE求解器存在效率问题：神经网络求解器依赖随机训练效率低，高斯过程求解器在处理大量配置点时存在可扩展性问题。

Method: 使用张量分解将高维GP分解为一维GP的集合，采用部分冻结策略和牛顿法线性化非线性项，开发交替最小二乘法进行高效训练。

Result: 在多个基准PDE上的实验表明，该方法相比现有方法实现了更高的精度和效率。

Conclusion: TGPS方法通过张量分解和高效训练策略，成功解决了传统PDE求解器的效率和可扩展性问题，具有理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have
attracted growing interest. However, most existing approaches, such as neural
network solvers, rely on stochastic training, which is inefficient and
typically requires a great many training epochs. Gaussian process
(GP)/kernel-based solvers, while mathematical principled, suffer from
scalability issues when handling large numbers of collocation points often
needed for challenging or higher-dimensional PDEs.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose TGPS, a tensor-GP-based solver that
models factor functions along each input dimension using one-dimensional GPs
and combines them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution.
This design reduces the task to learning a collection of one-dimensional GPs,
substantially lowering computational complexity, and enabling scalability to
massive collocation sets.
  For efficient nonlinear PDE solving, we use a partial freezing strategy and
Newton's method to linerize the nonlinear terms. We then develop an alternating
least squares (ALS) approach that admits closed-form updates, thereby
substantially enhancing the training efficiency. We establish theoretical
guarantees on the expressivity of our model, together with convergence proof
and error analysis under standard regularity assumptions. Experiments on
several benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy
and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Motivation: 当前方法主要使用任务特定模型，而现有的空间表示基础模型通常只支持有限模态且缺乏多模态融合能力，需要开发能有效整合多种地理空间数据的通用模型。

Method: 使用模态特定编码器处理不同输入类型，通过基于Transformer的融合模块学习统一表示，支持在预训练和推理期间灵活使用任何可用模态子集。

Result: 在56个城市的41个任务评估中，UrbanFusion在位置编码方面优于先前基础模型，支持推理期间的多模态输入，并能很好地泛化到训练中未见过的区域。

Conclusion: UrbanFusion能够灵活利用任何可用模态子集，在多样化数据可用性场景中具有广泛适用性，为城市现象预测提供了有效的多模态融合解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health
indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data.
Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation
models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and
lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present
UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal
Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process
different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data,
cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs
are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified
representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide
demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance
compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms
prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during
inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training.
UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given
location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability
across diverse data availability scenarios. All source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在训练大语言模型中变得至关重要，但缺乏像预训练那样的可预测扩展方法，无法评估算法改进对RL计算扩展的影响。

Method: 进行了超过40万GPU小时的大规模系统研究，拟合RL训练的S型计算-性能曲线，分析各种设计选择对渐近性能和计算效率的影响。

Result: 发现不同配方的渐近性能不同；损失聚合、归一化等细节主要调节计算效率而非改变渐近值；稳定的配方遵循可预测的扩展轨迹。

Conclusion: 提出了ScaleRL最佳实践配方，在10万GPU小时的单个RL运行中成功扩展并预测了验证性能，使RL训练更接近预训练的可预测性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language
models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable
to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets,
there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic
improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale
systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a
principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit
sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of
common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and
compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic
performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum,
and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without
materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow
predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale
runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and
demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation
performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work
provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a
practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long
achieved in pre-training.

Abstract: Temporal graph classification plays a critical role in applications such as
cybersecurity, brain connectivity analysis, social dynamics, and traffic
monitoring. Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored
compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods
often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose
fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies.
Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures.
  We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that
leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class
tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This
design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled
cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic
social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks.
It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and
structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining
topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph
learning.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击多为确定性策略，容易被受害者智能体逆转。需要开发一种理论上"不可战胜"的攻击方法，提高对抗攻击的有效性。

Method: 采用率失真信息论方法，随机改变智能体对转移核等环境属性的观测，使其在训练过程中无法获取或只能获取有限的真实环境信息。

Result: 推导了受害者智能体奖励遗憾的信息论下界，证明了该攻击对最先进的基于模型和无模型算法的影响。

Conclusion: 这种信息论方法可扩展到其他类型的对抗攻击（如状态观测攻击），为强化学习系统的安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has emerged
in many security-related applications, such as autonomous driving, financial
decisions, and drone/robot algorithms. In order to improve the
robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various
adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work
considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the
recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In
this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of
adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion
information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the
transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very
limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during
the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient
agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this
notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial
attack, such as state observation attacks.

Motivation: 交互连续时间马尔可夫链系统是强大的模型类，但在高维设置下推断通常难以处理。离散时间的辅助信息需要通过Doob's h-变换整合，导致难以处理的后验过程需要近似。

Method: 引入Latent Interacting Particle Systems模型类，参数化系统中每个马尔可夫链的生成器。推断方法包括估计预测未来信息的前瞻函数（扭曲势能），并引入高效参数化。将此近似整合到扭曲序贯蒙特卡洛采样方案中。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理高维交互连续时间马尔可夫链系统的后验推断问题，在复杂模型和真实数据应用中表现出良好性能。

Abstract: Systems of interacting continuous-time Markov chains are a powerful model
class, but inference is typically intractable in high dimensional settings.
Auxiliary information, such as noisy observations, is typically only available
at discrete times, and incorporating it via a Doob's $h-$transform gives rise
to an intractable posterior process that requires approximation. We introduce
Latent Interacting Particle Systems, a model class parameterizing the generator
of each Markov chain in the system. Our inference method involves estimating
look-ahead functions (twist potentials) that anticipate future information, for
which we introduce an efficient parameterization. We incorporate this
approximation in a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a challenging posterior
inference task for a latent SIRS model on a graph, and on a neural model for
wildfire spread dynamics trained on real data.

Motivation: 传统概率图模型(PGMs)只能处理成对交互，限制了在高维系统中建模复杂统计依赖关系的能力。需要扩展模型来处理更高阶的交互。

Conclusion: SGM成功扩展了高斯概率图模型到单纯形复形，能够建模高阶交互，为复杂系统的统计建模提供了新工具。

Abstract: Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are powerful tools for representing
statistical dependencies through graphs in high-dimensional systems. However,
they are limited to pairwise interactions. In this work, we propose the
simplicial Gaussian model (SGM), which extends Gaussian PGM to simplicial
complexes. SGM jointly models random variables supported on vertices, edges,
and triangles, within a single parametrized Gaussian distribution. Our model
builds upon discrete Hodge theory and incorporates uncertainty at every
topological level through independent random components. Motivated by
applications, we focus on the marginal edge-level distribution while treating
node- and triangle-level variables as latent. We then develop a
maximum-likelihood inference algorithm to recover the parameters of the full
SGM and the induced conditional dependence structure. Numerical experiments on
synthetic simplicial complexes with varying size and sparsity confirm the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

Motivation: 现有方法需要已知有限的标签空间，且依赖随机样本分割，存在两个局限：无法为测试时的新标签提供足够覆盖，以及对已见标签的预测可能过于保守。

Method: 计算并整合新的保形p值来测试数据点是否属于新类别，开发了基于标签频率的选择性样本分割算法，通过重新加权保持有限样本保证。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了开放集和高度不平衡分类中的保形预测问题，建立了与Good-Turing估计器的理论联系，并通过选择性分割提高了数据利用效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a conformal prediction method for classification in
highly imbalanced and open-set settings, where there are many possible classes
and not all may be represented in the data. Existing approaches require a
finite, known label space and typically involve random sample splitting, which
works well when there is a sufficient number of observations from each class.
Consequently, they have two limitations: (i) they fail to provide adequate
coverage when encountering new labels at test time, and (ii) they may become
overly conservative when predicting previously seen labels. To obtain valid
prediction sets in the presence of unseen labels, we compute and integrate into
our predictions a new family of conformal p-values that can test whether a new
data point belongs to a previously unseen class. We study these p-values
theoretically, establishing their optimality, and uncover an intriguing
connection with the classical Good--Turing estimator for the probability of
observing a new species. To make more efficient use of imbalanced data, we also
develop a selective sample splitting algorithm that partitions training and
calibration data based on label frequency, leading to more informative
predictions. Despite breaking exchangeability, this allows maintaining
finite-sample guarantees through suitable re-weighting. With both simulated and
real data, we demonstrate our method leads to prediction sets with valid
coverage even in challenging open-set scenarios with infinite numbers of
possible labels, and produces more informative predictions under extreme class
imbalance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法将问题简化为二元分类，无法区分语义相近（近OOD）和语义遥远（远OOD）的未知风险，这在需要细粒度风险分层的应用中构成安全瓶颈。

Method: 构建低熵语义流形来反映数据的内在语义层次结构，设计分层原型网络，引入语义惊喜向量（SSV）将样本的总惊喜分解为三个可解释维度：一致性、新颖性和模糊性。

Conclusion: 信息论框架为OOD检测提供了更精细的风险分层能力，语义惊喜向量提供了可解释的风险分析维度，在安全关键应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is a cornerstone for the safe deployment
of AI systems in the open world. However, existing methods treat OOD detection
as a binary classification problem, a cognitive flattening that fails to
distinguish between semantically close (Near-OOD) and distant (Far-OOD) unknown
risks. This limitation poses a significant safety bottleneck in applications
requiring fine-grained risk stratification. To address this, we propose a
paradigm shift from a conventional probabilistic view to a principled
information-theoretic framework. We formalize the core task as quantifying the
Semantic Surprise of a new sample and introduce a novel ternary classification
challenge: In-Distribution (ID) vs. Near-OOD vs. Far-OOD. The theoretical
foundation of our work is the concept of Low-Entropy Semantic Manifolds, which
are explicitly structured to reflect the data's intrinsic semantic hierarchy.
To construct these manifolds, we design a Hierarchical Prototypical Network. We
then introduce the Semantic Surprise Vector (SSV), a universal probe that
decomposes a sample's total surprise into three complementary and interpretable
dimensions: conformity, novelty, and ambiguity. To evaluate performance on this
new task, we propose the Normalized Semantic Risk (nSR), a cost-sensitive
metric. Experiments demonstrate that our framework not only establishes a new
state-of-the-art (sota) on the challenging ternary task, but its robust
representations also achieve top results on conventional binary benchmarks,
reducing the False Positive Rate by over 60% on datasets like LSUN.

Conclusion: ε-高斯可证明性比ε-可证明性更优，能更好地与噪声添加机制兼容，解释了之前方法需要更多步骤的原因。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to efficiently remove the influence of selected data
while preserving generalization. Significant progress has been made in low
dimensions $(p \ll n)$, but high dimensions pose serious theoretical challenges
as standard optimization assumptions of $\Omega(1)$ strong convexity and $O(1)$
smoothness of the per-example loss $f$ rarely hold simultaneously in
proportional regimes $(p\sim n)$. In this work, we introduce
$\varepsilon$-Gaussian certifiability, a canonical and robust notion
well-suited to high-dimensional regimes, that optimally captures a broad class
of noise adding mechanisms. Then we theoretically analyze the performance of a
widely used unlearning algorithm based on one step of the Newton method in the
high-dimensional setting described above. Our analysis shows that a single
Newton step, followed by a well-calibrated Gaussian noise, is sufficient to
achieve both privacy and accuracy in this setting. This result stands in sharp
contrast to the only prior work that analyzes machine unlearning in high
dimensions \citet{zou2025certified}, which relaxes some of the standard
optimization assumptions for high-dimensional applicability, but operates under
the notion of $\varepsilon$-certifiability. That work concludes %that a single
Newton step is insufficient even for removing a single data point, and that at
least two steps are required to ensure both privacy and accuracy. Our result
leads us to conclude that the discrepancy in the number of steps arises because
of the sub optimality of the notion of $\varepsilon$-certifiability and its
incompatibility with noise adding mechanisms, which $\varepsilon$-Gaussian
certifiability is able to overcome optimally.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然先前工作已证明对比散度算法在渐近情况下以O(n^{-1/3})速率收敛，但缺乏对其非渐近性能的分析，特别是能否达到更快的参数化速率。

Method: 使用非渐近分析方法，考虑不同的数据批处理方案，包括完全在线和小批量方式，分析CD算法的收敛性能。

Result: 在正则性假设下，CD算法可以达到参数化速率O(n^{-1/2})，且其渐近方差接近Cramér-Rao下界，表明算法接近最优。

Conclusion: 对比散度算法在适当条件下可以达到参数化收敛速率，且性能接近理论最优，这为非归一化模型的训练提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We perform a non-asymptotic analysis of the contrastive divergence (CD)
algorithm, a training method for unnormalized models. While prior work has
established that (for exponential family distributions) the CD iterates
asymptotically converge at an $O(n^{-1 / 3})$ rate to the true parameter of the
data distribution, we show, under some regularity assumptions, that CD can
achieve the parametric rate $O(n^{-1 / 2})$. Our analysis provides results for
various data batching schemes, including the fully online and minibatch ones.
We additionally show that CD can be near-optimal, in the sense that its
asymptotic variance is close to the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound.

Method: 开发了鲁棒极小极大提升方法，最小化最坏情况错误概率，对一般类型的标签噪声具有鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明RMBoost不仅对标签噪声具有弹性，还能提供强大的分类准确率。

Conclusion: RMBoost方法在标签噪声环境下具有优越性能，并提供了相对于无噪声误差和贝叶斯风险的理论保证。

Abstract: Boosting methods often achieve excellent classification accuracy, but can
experience notable performance degradation in the presence of label noise.
Existing robust methods for boosting provide theoretical robustness guarantees
for certain types of label noise, and can exhibit only moderate performance
degradation. However, previous theoretical results do not account for realistic
types of noise and finite training sizes, and existing robust methods can
provide unsatisfactory accuracies, even without noise. This paper presents
methods for robust minimax boosting (RMBoost) that minimize worst-case error
probabilities and are robust to general types of label noise. In addition, we
provide finite-sample performance guarantees for RMBoost with respect to the
error obtained without noise and with respect to the best possible error (Bayes
risk). The experimental results corroborate that RMBoost is not only resilient
to label noise but can also provide strong classification accuracy.

Motivation: 从独立同分布观测数据进行因果发现通常是病态的。本文旨在探索在更少环境信息下实现因果图识别的可能性，特别是与非线性独立成分分析(ICA)的对比。

Method: 利用结构因果模型的分布和来自两个噪声统计足够不同的环境的数据。主要约束是噪声项的高斯性，但提出了放松此约束的潜在方法。

Result: 证明了在仅两个环境且噪声统计充分不同的条件下，可以唯一识别整个因果图。这是首个在恒定环境数量和任意非线性机制下保证因果图恢复的结果。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了独立成分分析与因果发现之间的对偶关系，表明因果发现可以在比非线性ICA所需更少的辅助信息下实现。为因果发现提供了新的理论保证和方法框架。

Abstract: Causal discovery from i.i.d. observational data is known to be generally
ill-posed. We demonstrate that if we have access to the distribution of a
structural causal model, and additional data from only two environments that
sufficiently differ in the noise statistics, the unique causal graph is
identifiable. Notably, this is the first result in the literature that
guarantees the entire causal graph recovery with a constant number of
environments and arbitrary nonlinear mechanisms. Our only constraint is the
Gaussianity of the noise terms; however, we propose potential ways to relax
this requirement. Of interest on its own, we expand on the well-known duality
between independent component analysis (ICA) and causal discovery; recent
advancements have shown that nonlinear ICA can be solved from multiple
environments, at least as many as the number of sources: we show that the same
can be achieved for causal discovery while having access to much less auxiliary
information.

Abstract: Amortized simulator-based inference offers a powerful framework for tackling
Bayesian inference in computational fields such as engineering or neuroscience,
increasingly leveraging modern generative methods like diffusion models to map
observed data to model parameters or future predictions. These approaches yield
posterior or posterior-predictive samples for new datasets without requiring
further simulator calls after training on simulated parameter-data pairs.
However, their applicability is often limited by the prior distribution(s) used
to generate model parameters during this training phase. To overcome this
constraint, we introduce PriorGuide, a technique specifically designed for
diffusion-based amortized inference methods. PriorGuide leverages a novel
guidance approximation that enables flexible adaptation of the trained
diffusion model to new priors at test time, crucially without costly
retraining. This allows users to readily incorporate updated information or
expert knowledge post-training, enhancing the versatility of pre-trained
inference models.
