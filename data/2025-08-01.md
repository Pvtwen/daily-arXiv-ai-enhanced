  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模全数字MIMO面临的高能耗、高成本和复杂性挑战，同时解决异构混合模拟-数字H2AD MIMO架构中多发射源数量和方向感知的难题。

Method: 设计了两阶段感知框架，包括三种目标数量感知方法（改进的EDC、增强的DNN和1D-CNN）和低复杂度高精度的OMC-DOA方向估计方法，并推导了多源条件下的CRLB。

Result: 三种目标数量感知方法在中高信噪比下达到100%准确率，1D-CNN在极低信噪比下表现优异；OMC-DOA在多源环境中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了H2AD MIMO架构中的多源感知问题，为未来无线网络提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO
architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or
extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to
address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy
consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to
intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a
structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a
two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction
values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods
are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced
deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an
improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full
eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is
achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.
Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under
multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation
results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets
sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior
under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing
clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤手术切除可能导致术后认知功能障碍，研究旨在通过术前神经动力学特征预测术后工作记忆衰退，为个性化手术规划提供依据。

Method: 分析术前fMRI数据，提取高阶脑交互能量特征，使用统计和随机森林模型评估与术后工作记忆表现的关系。

Conclusion: 术前高阶神经动力学特征可预测术后工作记忆衰退，为个性化手术和干预提供新方向。

Abstract: Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients,
but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study
investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics
relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted
energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the
relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory
performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models.
Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but
more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas
patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts.
Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately
predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1
score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain
tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are
predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path
for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate
cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成扩散模型的环境感知跨基站CKM推理方法BS-1-to-N，通过BSLE嵌入基站位置信息，利用交叉和自注意力机制实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在分布式节点架构中构建CKM成本高昂，而不同基站的CKM共享相同的无线环境，因此需要一种高效的环境感知跨基站CKM推理方法。

Method: 设计了BSLE方法嵌入基站位置信息，利用交叉和自注意力机制学习源与目标基站间的关系，以及目标基站间的关系，实现基于源CKM和位置信息的跨基站CKM推理。

Result: 提出的BS-1-to-N模型能够高效地为任意潜在位置的基站推断CKM，显著优于传统方法，并通过实际应用案例验证了其在基站部署优化中的实用性。

Conclusion: BS-1-to-N方法通过挖掘CKM与基站位置的隐含关联，实现了高效的跨基站CKM推理，为环境感知通信提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) inference across base stations (BSs) is the key
to achieving efficient environmentaware communications. This paper proposes an
environmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the
generative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location
embedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS
location information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the
cross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to
respectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as
that among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target
BSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM
inference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs.
Specifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free
networks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM
construction are prohibitively costly. By contrast, the proposed BS-1-to-N
model is able to achieve efficient CKM inference for a target BS at any
potential location based on the CKMs of source BSs. This is achieved by
exploiting the fact that within a given area, different BSs share the same
wireless environment that leads to their respective CKMs. Therefore, similar to
multi-view synthesis, CKMs of different BSs are representations of the same
wireless environment from different BS locations. By mining the implicit
correlation between CKM and BS location based on the wireless environment, the
proposed BS-1-to-N method achieves efficient CKM inference across BSs. We
provide extensive comparisons of CKM inference between the proposed BS-1-to-N
generative model versus benchmarking schemes, and provide one use case study to
demonstrate its practical application for the optimization of BS deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RIS在非对齐收发器通信中受限，NR-BD-RIS通过非互易性增强波控制能力，适用于全双工系统。

Method: 提出基于NR-BD-RIS的系统模型，结合物理散射效应，采用BCD和PDD算法优化多用户和速率。

Conclusion: NR-BD-RIS为全双工通信提供了高效、安全的解决方案，验证了其性能优势。

Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has arisen as a
promising technology for enhancing wireless communication systems by enabling
flexible and intelligent wave manipulation. This is achieved through the
interconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave
reconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at
one port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local
control of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further
enhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently,
channel reciprocity. This feature potentially benefits communication among
non-aligned transceivers. This paper introduces a novel application of
NR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices
communicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure
transmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses
signal from all other users, and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a
physics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural
scattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect,
the advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate
an all-user sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization
algorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual
decomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS
consistently outperforms reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and conventional diagonal
(D)-RIS in terms of sum-rate performance, particularly when more than two
impinging and reflection directions need to be supported. By analyzing the
power of signals from all other users and the beampatterns, we show that secure
transmission can be achieved.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于FPGA的硬件EVM（EVMx），用于加速智能合约执行，性能显著优于传统CPU环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EVM性能受限于通用计算机的约束，影响了智能合约和区块链平台的效率。

Method: 设计并实现了FPGA为基础的硬件EVM（EVMx），利用硬件架构的并行性和高速处理能力。

Result: EVMx将常用操作码的执行时间减少了61%至99%，区块执行速度比文献中的类似工作快6倍。

Conclusion: EVMx架构有望显著提升智能合约执行速度和EVM兼容区块链的性能。

Abstract: Ethereum blockchain uses smart contracts (SCs) to implement decentralized
applications (dApps). SCs are executed by the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM)
running within an Ethereum client. Moreover, the EVM has been widely adopted by
other blockchain platforms, including Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, and
more. However, the EVM performance is limited by the constraints of the
general-purpose computer it operates on. This work proposes offloading SC
execution onto a dedicated hardware-based EVM. Specifically, EVMx is an
FPGA-based SC execution engine that benefits from the inherent parallelism and
high-speed processing capabilities of a hardware architecture. Synthesis
results demonstrate a reduction in execution time of 61% to 99% for commonly
used operation codes compared to CPU-based SC execution environments. Moreover,
the execution time of Ethereum blocks on EVMx is up to 6x faster compared to
analogous works in the literature. These results highlight the potential of the
proposed architecture to accelerate SC execution and enhance the performance of
EVM-compatible blockchains.

Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems are expected to adopt extremely
large aperture arrays (ELAAs), novel antenna architectures, and operate in
extremely high-frequency bands to meet growing data demands. ELAAs
significantly increase the number of antennas, enabling finer spatial
resolution and improved beamforming. At high frequencies, ELAAs shift
communication from the conventional far-field to near-field regime, where
spherical wavefronts dominate and the channel response depends on both angle
and distance, increasing channel dimensionality. Conventional far-field channel
estimation methods, which rely on angular information, struggle in near-field
scenarios due to increased pilot overhead and computational complexity. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in near-field channel
estimation. It first defines the near- and far-field boundary from an
electromagnetic perspective and discusses key propagation differences,
alongside a brief review of ELAA developments. Then, it introduces mainstream
near-field channel models and compares them with far-field models. Major
estimation techniques are reviewed under different configurations
(single/multi-user, single/multi-carrier), including both direct estimation and
RIS-assisted cascaded estimation. These techniques reveal trade-offs among
estimation accuracy, complexity, and overhead. This survey aims to provide
insights and foundations for efficient and scalable near-field channel
estimation in 6G systems, while identifying key challenges and future research
directions.

Motivation: 传统图分数傅里叶变换（GFRFT）对所有图频率使用单一分数阶，限制了其适应不同信号特性的能力。

Method: 提出两种MPGFRFT，建立理论框架，设计谱压缩策略和可学习阶向量方案。

Result: 实验验证了MPGFRFT在多种图信号处理任务中的优越性能，包括图像加密和解密。

Conclusion: MPGFRFT框架具有灵活性和高性能，适用于广泛的信号处理应用。

Abstract: The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) applies a single global
fractional order to all graph frequencies, which restricts its adaptability to
diverse signal characteristics across the spectral domain. To address this
limitation, in this paper, we propose two types of multiple-parameter GFRFTs
(MPGFRFTs) and establish their corresponding theoretical frameworks. We design
a spectral compression strategy tailored for ultra-low compression ratios,
effectively preserving essential information even under extreme dimensionality
reduction. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a learnable order vector scheme
that enables adaptive compression and denoising, demonstrating strong
performance on both graph signals and images. We explore the application of
MPGFRFTs to image encryption and decryption. Experimental results validate the
versatility and superior performance of the proposed MPGFRFT framework across
various graph signal processing tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架为无线网络优化提供了理论支持，特别是在凸性条件和速率最大化问题中，为高效求解器设计和网络性能优化奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for analyzing utility regions of wireless
networks, with a focus on the signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) and
achievable rate regions. The framework provides valuable insights into
interference patterns of modern network architectures, such as cell-less and
extremely large MIMO networks, and it generalizes existing characterizations of
the weak Pareto boundary. A central contribution is the derivation of
sufficient conditions that guarantee convexity of the utility regions.
Convexity is an important property because it ensures that time sharing (or
user grouping) cannot simultaneously increase the utility of all users when the
network operates on the weak Pareto boundary. These sufficient conditions also
have two key implications. First, they identify a family of (weighted) sum-rate
maximization problems that are inherently convex without any variable
transformations, thus paving the way for the development of efficient, provably
optimal solvers for this family. Second, they provide a rigorous justification
for formulating sum-rate maximization problems directly in terms of achievable
rates, rather than SINR levels. Our theoretical insights also motivate an
alternative to the concept of favorable propagation in the massive MIMO
literature -- one that explicitly accounts for self-interference and the
beamforming strategy.

Abstract: Real-time transmission of high-resolution video signals in an uncompressed

communications (URLLC) medium with high bandwidth to maintain the quality of
experience (QoE) for users. We put forward the design and experimental
demonstration of a high-performance laser-based optical wireless communication
(OWC) system that enables high-definition (HD) video transmission with
submillisecond latencies. The serial digital interface (SDI) output of a camera
is used to transmit the live video stream over an optical wireless link by
directly modulating the SDI signal on the intensity of a 940 nm vertical cavity
surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The proposed SDI over light fidelity (LiFi)
system corroborates error-free transmission of full HD (FHD) and 4K
ultra-high-definition (UHD) resolutions at data rates of 2.97 Gb/s and 5.94
Gb/s, respectively, with a measured end-to-end latency of under 35 ns. Since
SDI standards support various video formats and VCSELs are high-bandwidth and
low-power devices, this presents a scalable and inexpensive solution for
wireless connectivity between professional broadcast equipment using
off-the-shelf SDI components.

Conclusion: NeuroAR能够高保真地模拟个体特异性脑老化轨迹，显著优于其他关键模型。

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

Method: 通过架构设计、训练策略、应用效果及与MLPs的对比评估，从三个视角（数据驱动学习、物理建模、深度算子学习）分类分析了KANs的进展。

Result: KANs在准确性、收敛性和频谱表示上均优于MLPs，能更有效地捕捉复杂动态。

Conclusion: KANs在科学机器学习中展现出显著优势，但仍需解决计算效率、理论保证等挑战，未来研究应关注其鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and
physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合深度学习与可解释人工智能（XAI）的多灾害预警框架，用于农业气候风险管理，具有高预测准确性和时间解释能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单灾害预警方法无法捕捉复杂气候事件的交互作用，气候变化加剧了农业风险，亟需智能化的持续学习系统。

Method: 结合序列深度学习模型（如BiLSTM）和XAI技术（如TimeSHAP），构建多灾害预测框架，并针对不同灾害类型定制模型。

Result: 实验验证了框架的高预测准确性，尤其是BiLSTM架构，同时提供了时间特征影响的详细解释。

Conclusion: 该研究显著提升了多灾害预警系统的可解释性和实用性，支持农业气候风险管理的有效决策。

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

Motivation: 心血管疾病每年导致大量死亡，亟需隐私保护的预测系统。

Method: 提出FedCVD++框架，包括树子集采样、XGBoost特征提取和联邦SMOTE同步。

Result: 在Framingham数据集上，FedCVD++表现优异，通信效率提升3.2倍，F1分数提高15%。

Conclusion: FedCVD++首次将非参数模型成功整合到联邦医疗系统中，提供了隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural
networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart
disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient
strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into
federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated
under real-world clinical constraints.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应集成聚合方法（DEA），通过可学习的方向参数动态调整Q值估计，以优化连续控制任务中的强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态集成聚合方法（如取最小值）在连续控制任务中过于粗糙，无法适应任务需求或学习阶段的变化，导致信息浪费和性能下降。

Method: DEA引入两个可学习的方向参数：一个调节批评者的保守性，另一个指导行动者的策略探索。参数通过基于贝尔曼误差方向的加权机制学习。

Result: DEA在多种连续控制基准和学习模式下均优于静态集成策略，表现出更高的适应性和性能。

Conclusion: DEA通过数据驱动的动态聚合机制，显著提升了连续控制任务中强化学习的效率和效果。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着极端热事件的加剧，城市需要高效且可扩展的工具来评估和缓解户外热压力。

Method: 提出GSM-UTCI框架，融合地表形态、土地覆盖数据和气象条件，使用FiLM架构动态调整空间特征。

Result: 模型在R2和MAE上表现优异，推理时间大幅缩短，并在费城模拟中展示了显著的降温效果。

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI是一种可扩展的决策支持工具，适用于城市气候适应策略的评估。

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,
and performance are crucial.

Result: 指出人类测试用于AI评估缺乏理论和实证支持，呼吁转向AI专用测试。

Conclusion: 应停止用人类测试评估AI，开发针对AI的评估框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

Result: 实验表明，虽然优化可以强制模型生成与目标对齐的输出，但逆向映射的感知质量和语义解释性较差。

Conclusion: 多模态潜在空间缺乏支持稳健逆向映射的结构，需进一步研究开发语义丰富且可逆的潜在空间。

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

Result: 实验显示KLLM在速度和能效上显著优于A100 GPU和Atom。

Conclusion: KLLM有效解决了WAQ的挑战，为LLM推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

Conclusion: 基于时间序列的行为分析方法能更细致地理解个体行为对整体流程效率的影响。

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

Motivation: 万古霉素是ICU治疗严重革兰氏阳性感染的关键抗生素，但肾毒性风险高，早期预测肾损伤具有挑战性。

Method: 研究分析了10,288名ICU患者数据，使用KDIGO标准定义肾损伤，通过特征选择和多种算法（如CatBoost）开发预测模型。

Result: CatBoost表现最佳（AUROC 0.818），关键预测因子包括磷酸盐、总胆红素等，SHAP和ALE提供了可解释性分析。

Conclusion: 该模型能准确预测万古霉素相关肌酐升高，支持ICU早期风险检测和干预。

Abstract: Background: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections
in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in
critically ill patients is challenging. This study aimed to develop a machine
learning model to predict vancomycin-related creatinine elevation using routine
ICU data.
  Methods: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV
database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria
(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were
selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six
algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was
evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior
sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation.
CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800,
specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were
phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP
confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns.
Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%)
in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated
creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and
interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely
interventions in critical care.

that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical
performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general
lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any
differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match
these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable
insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据隐私协议允许用户选择不共享数据，加上设备异构性导致的数据缺失，会引入偏差并降低模型性能。

Method: 提出FLOSS系统，通过技术手段减少数据缺失对联邦学习的影响。

Result: 在模拟实验中验证了FLOSS系统的有效性。

Conclusion: FLOSS能有效缓解联邦学习中数据缺失带来的问题。

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

Motivation: 先前研究在计算机视觉中已发现分布内（ID）和分布外（OOD）精度之间的强相关性，但在音频模型中这种关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过多种神经网络架构在不同评估集上进行基准测试，并使用公平性（F）和鲁棒性（R）两个指标量化噪声对泛化的影响。

Result: 噪声感知训练在某些配置中提高了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了噪声增强在语音模型泛化中的益处和局限性。

Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, such
relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models. In this study, we
investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness
and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD
conditions. We benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of
evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use
of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID
and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves
robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the
benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in
speech models.

Conclusion: 后悔度量能有效识别预测任意性，为提升模型安全性提供实用工具。

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

Motivation: 传统AI求解器在处理微分方程时面临数据稀缺和高频分量逼近困难的问题，需要一种更高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: 结合先验知识或随机场生成解，通过平衡微分方程生成大量训练数据；引入可逆SDO和基于注意力的Transformer求解器，优化高频分量逼近。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多种微分方程上优于现有技术，且训练效率高。

Conclusion: 该AI范式为微分方程求解提供了高效、通用的解决方案，适用于广泛的自然和工程领域。

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市热浪、干旱和土地退化是气候变化背景下的紧迫问题，需要高时空分辨率的地表温度数据来研究。

Method: FuseTen采用生成架构，结合注意力机制和归一化模块，使用基于物理原理的监督策略和PatchGAN判别器。

Result: 实验表明，FuseTen在定量指标和视觉保真度上分别平均提升32.06%和31.42%，优于线性基线方法。

Conclusion: FuseTen是首个能以10米空间分辨率生成每日LST数据的非线性方法。

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NaN-propagation的方法，利用IEEE 754浮点数的NaN特性检测黑盒函数的稀疏性，避免了传统有限差分法的假阴性问题，显著提升了梯度计算的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限差分法在检测黑盒函数稀疏性时存在假阴性问题，导致梯度计算错误且难以诊断。

Method: 通过系统性地用NaN污染输入并观察输出是否变为NaN，重建保守的稀疏模式，消除假阴性。

Result: 在航空航天机翼重量模型中，实现了1.52倍的加速，并检测到传统方法遗漏的数十个依赖关系。

Conclusion: NaN-propagation方法利用IEEE 754标准，无需修改现有黑盒代码即可跨语言和数学库工作，显著提升了稀疏性检测的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

Result: 查询延迟从3.89秒降至2.12秒，效率提升45%；在MMLongBench-Doc基准测试中准确率达64.7%。

Conclusion: DocsRay通过无需训练的方法，在多模态文档理解任务中表现优异，显著超越现有技术。

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 解决AI生成文本中存在的上下文幻觉问题，提供一种实用且可解释的检测方法。

Method: 使用生成器无关的观察模型，通过单次前向传播和残差流上的线性探针检测幻觉，并利用梯度-激活定位信号。

Result: 发现了一个可转移的线性方向，能有效区分幻觉与忠实文本，且可通过操纵该方向控制幻觉率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了内部低维幻觉信号与特定MLP子电路的关联，为检测和缓解幻觉提供了新途径，并发布了ContraTales基准数据集。

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着隐私问题日益突出，机器遗忘（让模型“忘记”特定训练数据）需求增加，但现有基于影响的遗忘方法因计算Hessian矩阵及其逆矩阵的开销过大而难以实用。

Method: 论文从认知科学中“记忆比遗忘更容易”的理论出发，建立了记忆（增量学习）与遗忘（机器遗忘）的理论联系，并基于此提出了高效的IAU算法。

Result: 实验表明，IAU在保证数据删除效果、遗忘效率和模型性能方面优于现有方法，适用于多种数据集和模型架构。

Conclusion: IAU通过增量学习视角实现了高效机器遗忘，为大规模模型和频繁数据删除场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

Result: 在问答、数学推理和编程任务中，DynaSwarm表现优于现有单智能体和多智能体基线。

Conclusion: 样本感知的结构灵活性对LLM多智能体系统设计至关重要。

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed
and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic
framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an
actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph
structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic
graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each
input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the
need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging
sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized
agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to
fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that
DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS
baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance
of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

Result: 发现样本的内在学习难度与隐私风险之间存在强相关性，且最终模型中高度脆弱的样本的隐私风险在训练早期就已确定。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解隐私风险在训练过程中的动态出现提供了基础，支持开发主动的隐私感知模型训练策略。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

Conclusion: SequenceLayers为序列建模提供了高效、正确且易于使用的工具，适用于生产级模型开发。

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers
(JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖稀疏的结果奖励反馈，导致优化效率低下。本文旨在通过过程奖励模型提供更密集的反馈，加速LRMs的训练。

Method: 提出内在信号驱动的生成过程评估机制，将连续正确/错误的步骤聚合为连贯的‘思考’单元，并引入能力自适应奖励机制动态平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在1.5B和7B参数的LRMs上实验表明，该方法比仅依赖结果奖励的基线方法显著提高了问题解决准确率，且训练样本更少。

Conclusion: 结构化的过程奖励能显著加速LRMs在数学推理任务中的优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is

sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

*Tatsuya Mitomi,Fumiyasu Makinoshima,Fumiya Makihara,Eigo Segawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于可微分代理模拟的动态定价方法，用于优化共享单车系统的库存平衡，显著减少损失并提高收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享单车系统中，时空变化的用户需求导致库存不平衡，增加搬迁成本，因此需要通过动态定价优化用户需求管理。

Method: 开发了一种可微分代理模拟方法，用于快速设计动态定价策略，考虑了用户多样性和概率选择。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比传统方法减少了73%至78%的损失，收敛速度提高了100倍以上，并在大规模场景中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 动态定价策略能自然诱导库存平衡，无需人工搬迁，且通过设置合适的初始条件可最小化折扣成本。

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

Conclusion: 提出的因果解释框架提高了对概念漂移的理解和干预能力。

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

Conclusion: PLARE提供了一种高效、自动化的离线强化学习解决方案，减少了对人工奖励设计的依赖，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

Result: 在多个PDE基准测试中表现优于其他方案，参数更少且性能竞争性强，部分观测条件下表现更优。

Conclusion: 时空分解的算子学习方法高效且泛化性强，为PDE建模提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

Conclusion: Coflex为硬件感知神经架构搜索提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent
non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.
Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for
personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods.
This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed
T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients
(36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple
machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause
mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive
explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results. The
extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated
the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776,
with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of
0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause
mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to
interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside
application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting
timely treatment optimization.

Result: 证明在结构不确定性高、因果效应差异大且损失函数敏感时，模型平均方法有效。

Conclusion: 框架补充了现有因果推断方法，解决了常被忽视的结构不确定性。

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

Motivation: 研究证书长度与验证器运行时间的关系，以理解复杂性类之间的分离问题，如NP与EXPTIME，以及自然问题（如字符串周期性和旋转检测）的复杂性。

Method: 通过证明一个验证器权衡定理，展示了验证时间从f(n)减少到g(n)所需的最小证书长度。

Result: 验证器权衡定理表明，验证时间的减少需要至少Ω(log(f(n)/g(n)))的证书长度，并形成了一个基于证书复杂性的自然层次结构。

Conclusion: 该定理为复杂性类分离问题提供了新视角，并探讨了P与NP问题的子线性证书存在性。

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

Method: 提出了一种固定裁剪水平的DP-Clipped-SGD方法，适用于重尾噪声下的凸和非凸平滑优化问题。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了固定裁剪水平下高概率收敛分析的空白，为DP机制提供了更优的收敛速度和隐私权衡。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: 合成边界数据作为隐式正则化器，有效提升决策边界稳定性，显著缓解灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is

a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise orders-of-magnitude lower power
consumption and low-latency inference on neuromorphic hardware for a wide range
of robotic tasks. In this work, we present an energy-efficient implementation
of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using quantized SNNs to solve two
classical control tasks. The network is trained using the Q-learning algorithm,
then fine-tuned and quantized to low-bit (8-bit) precision for embedded
deployment on the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic chip. To evaluate the comparative
advantage of SpiNNaker2 over conventional computing platforms, we analyze
inference latency, dynamic power consumption, and energy cost per inference for
our SNN models, comparing performance against a GTX 1650 GPU baseline. Our
results demonstrate SpiNNaker2's strong potential for scalable, low-energy
neuromorphic computing, achieving up to 32x reduction in energy consumption.
Inference latency remains on par with GPU-based execution, with improvements
observed in certain task settings, reinforcing SpiNNaker2's viability for
real-time neuromorphic control and making the neuromorphic approach a
compelling direction for efficient deep Q-learning.

Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法在多跳推理中表现不足，因其检索和查询阶段依赖预定义启发式方法，未能充分利用LLM的推理潜力。

Method: 提出GraphRAG-R1框架，采用过程约束的强化学习（GRPO改进版）训练LLM，设计渐进检索衰减（PRA）和成本感知F1（CAF）奖励函数，并分阶段训练。

Result: 实验表明，GraphRAG-R1在复杂推理任务中优于现有GraphRAG方法，且能灵活集成多种检索方法。

Conclusion: GraphRAG-R1显著提升了LLM在多跳推理中的能力，具有广泛适用性和性能提升潜力。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently
delivering performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCR方法依赖用户指定组件数量，且在大规模数据或组件数量增加时面临可扩展性和可靠性问题。

Method: 将MCR重新定义为生成过程，使用能量基深度学习求解器EB-gMCR，通过可微分门控网络从候选池中保留活跃组件并估计其浓度。

Result: 在噪声合成数据中，EB-gMCR保持R^2 >= 0.98，组件数量恢复误差在5%以内；低噪声时R^2 >= 0.99，组件估计接近精确。

Conclusion: EB-gMCR结合高容量生成建模和硬组件选择，为大规模信号解混分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了分层策略和消息传递，提升了多智能体系统的协调和规划能力。

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

Result: 在真实数据实验中，模型能有效预测患者招募数量，表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床试验规划提供了更准确的预测工具，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上验证，L-GTA生成的增强数据更可靠、一致且可控，显著提升了预测准确性和相似性度量。

Conclusion: L-GTA为时间序列数据增强提供了一种高效且可控的方法，优于直接变换方法。

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

Result: 揭示了softmax注意力的优越性源于其RNN形式的特定结构和交互机制。

Conclusion: 通过RNN形式的分析，解释了softmax注意力比线性注意力更具表达力的原因。

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和阿尔茨海默MRI数据集上表现优异，比FLGuard提升1.6个百分点。

Conclusion: OptiGradTrust在防御攻击和处理数据异构性方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed medical institutions while preserving patient privacy, but remains
vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and statistical heterogeneity. We present
OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient
updates through a novel six-dimensional fingerprint including VAE
reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency
ratio, and Monte Carlo Shapley value, which drive a hybrid RL-attention module
for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data
heterogeneity, we develop FedBN-Prox (FedBN-P), combining Federated Batch
Normalization with proximal regularization for optimal accuracy-convergence
trade-offs. Extensive evaluation across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's MRI
datasets under various Byzantine attack scenarios demonstrates significant
improvements over state-of-the-art defenses, achieving up to +1.6 percentage

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have
become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in
guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a
SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance
constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage
sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across
samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification
tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model
regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
regression and classification datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves
generalization performance while ensuring robust and interpretable feature
attributions. The proposed technique offers a novel, explainability-driven
regularization approach, making machine learning models both more accurate and
more reliable.

Conclusion: TweakLLM是一种可扩展且资源高效的缓存解决方案，不影响用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and
latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach
proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the
limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present
TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to
dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

Method: 利用流匹配模型中的分布方差与单步采样离散化误差的理论联系，提出了基于流策略和MeanFlow策略的两种算法变体。

Result: 在MuJoCo基准测试中，性能与扩散策略基线相当，但推理时函数评估次数减少数百倍。

Conclusion: FPMD算法在保持高性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement
learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference
of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which
limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow
Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step
sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical
connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of
single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and
requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two
algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations,
respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate
that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy
baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during
inference.

Result: 在TCGA数据集上，DepMicroDiff的Pearson相关系数达0.712，余弦相似度达0.812，RMSE和MAE更低。

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff在微生物组数据插补中表现出鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of
non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is
typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot
settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant
difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous
samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a
methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly
detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We
compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study
the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an
augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the
different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular
industrial anomaly detection datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动学习（AL）中标注数据的成本和时间问题已得到关注，但现有方法未充分考虑标注者的内部因素（如情绪、疲劳）对标注质量的影响。

Method: 使用知识推荐系统（RS）对标注者进行排名，结合其历史准确性、情绪和疲劳水平以及查询实例信息，选择最佳标注者。

Result: 考虑内部因素显著减少了标注错误和模型不确定性，同时提高了准确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 该研究为探索人类认知因素对主动学习的影响提供了初步方法，证明了内部因素的重要性。

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型选择需要大量标注验证数据，成本高且耗时，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Result: 在26个基准任务上，CODA比现有方法显著减少70%以上的标注成本。

Conclusion: CODA提供了一种高效的主动模型选择方法，大幅降低了标注需求。

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

Conclusion: 提出的平滑框架解决了BWGD的不稳定性问题，并提供了严格的超线性收敛保证。

Abstract: We consider the phase retrieval problem, which involves recovering a rank-one
positive semidefinite matrix from rank-one measurements. A recently proposed
algorithm based on Bures-Wasserstein gradient descent (BWGD) exhibits
superlinear convergence, but it is unstable, and existing theory can only prove
local linear convergence for higher rank matrix recovery. We resolve this gap
by revealing that BWGD implements Newton's method with a nonsmooth and
nonconvex objective. We develop a smoothing framework that regularizes the
objective, enabling a stable method with rigorous superlinear convergence
guarantees. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate this superior stability
while maintaining fast convergence.

Result: 通过模拟研究和实际数据集验证了方法的性能，并建立了理论上的价值损失上限。

Conclusion: 该方法在平衡价值优化与公平性方面表现良好，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Individualized treatment rules (ITRs) have gained significant attention due
to their wide-ranging applications in fields such as precision medicine,
ridesharing, and advertising recommendations. However, when ITRs are influenced
by sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or age, they can lead to outcomes
where certain groups are unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged. To address this
gap, we propose a flexible approach based on the optimal transport theory,
which is capable of transforming any optimal ITR into a fair ITR that ensures
demographic parity. Recognizing the potential loss of value under fairness
constraints, we introduce an ``improved trade-off ITR," designed to balance
value optimization and fairness while accommodating varying levels of fairness
through parameter adjustment. To maximize the value of the improved trade-off
ITR under specific fairness levels, we propose a smoothed fairness constraint
for estimating the adjustable parameter. Additionally, we establish a
theoretical upper bound on the value loss for the improved trade-off ITR. We
demonstrate performance of the proposed method through extensive simulation
studies and application to the Next 36 entrepreneurial program dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合去标识化框架，结合规则和AI技术，用于安全去除医学影像数据中的敏感信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据共享对医疗研究至关重要，但其中的敏感信息（如PHI/PII）阻碍了数据的伦理和安全共享。

Method: 采用双层规则系统和AI驱动的命名实体识别（NER），结合不确定性量化技术，从元数据和像素数据中去除敏感信息。

Result: 该框架在多个基准数据集和法规标准（如DICOM、HIPAA）中表现出色，实现了高效的去标识化。

Conclusion: 该解决方案通过自动化、不确定性量化和质量保证，支持医学影像数据的安全、伦理共享。

Abstract: Access to medical imaging and associated text data has the potential to drive
major advances in healthcare research and patient outcomes. However, the
presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
files presents a significant barrier to the ethical and secure sharing of
imaging datasets. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework
developed by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines
rule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification
for comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data.
  Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit
and inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model
(LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of
synthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we
employ an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text,
extract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the
NER pipeline for final redaction. Crucially, uncertainty quantification
provides confidence measures for AI-based detections to enhance automation
reliability and enable informed human-in-the-loop verification to manage
residual risks.
  This uncertainty-aware deidentification framework achieves robust performance
across benchmark datasets and regulatory standards, including DICOM, HIPAA, and
TCIA compliance metrics. By combining scalable automation, uncertainty
quantification, and rigorous quality assurance, our solution addresses critical
challenges in medical data de-identification and supports the secure, ethical,
and trustworthy release of imaging data for research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过分析动态定价分布来识别二级票务市场中表演行为特征的新方法，结合随机森林分类器显著提高了分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示二级票务市场中表演行为的独特经济特征，并通过动态定价分布建模实现更准确的分类。

Method: 使用SeatGeek API的时间序列数据，将票价分布建模为缩放Beta分布，结合分位数匹配和矩估计方法进行参数估计，并将估计参数用于随机森林分类器。

Result: 方法显著提高了艺术家分类的准确性，并通过理论和实证证明零方差特征在随机森林中具有正则化效果。

Conclusion: 研究展示了动态定价分布建模的有效性，零方差特征的正则化作用为随机森林模型提供了新的改进方向。

Abstract: A novel approach is presented for identifying distinct signatures of
performing acts in the secondary ticket resale market by analyzing dynamic
pricing distributions. Using a newly curated, time series dataset from the
SeatGeek API, we model ticket pricing distributions as scaled Beta
distributions. This enables accurate parameter estimation from incomplete
statistical data using a hybrid of quantile matching and the method of moments.
Incorporating the estimated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters into Random Forest
classifiers significantly improves pairwise artist classification accuracy,
demonstrating the unique economic signatures in event pricing data.
Additionally, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that incorporating
zero-variance (constant-value) features into Random Forest models acts as an
implicit regularizer, enhancing feature variety and robustness. This
regularization promotes deeper, more varied trees in the ensemble, improving
the bias-variance tradeoff and mitigating overfitting to dominant features.
These findings are validated on both the new ticket pricing dataset and the
standard UCI ML handwritten digits dataset.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 新方法在遗传学应用中表现出优于频率学基线的预测性能，尤其在源数据有限时。

Conclusion: 提出的贝叶斯框架为数据有限时的转移学习提供了更灵活和强大的解决方案。

Abstract: In analyses with severe data-limitations, augmenting the target dataset with
information from ancillary datasets in the application domain, called source
datasets, can lead to significantly improved statistical procedures. However,
existing methods for this transfer learning struggle to deal with situations
where the source datasets are also limited and not guaranteed to be
well-aligned with the target dataset. A typical strategy is to use the
empirical loss minimizer on the source data as a prior mean for the target
parameters, which places the estimation of source parameters outside of the
Bayesian formalism. Our key conceptual contribution is to use a risk minimizer
conditional on source parameters instead. This allows us to construct a single
joint prior distribution for all parameters from the source datasets as well as
the target dataset. As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty
quantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over
indicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset. We show how
a particular instantiation of our prior leads to a Bayesian Lasso in a
transformed coordinate system and discuss computational techniques to scale our
approach to moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate that recently
proposed minimax-frequentist transfer learning techniques may be viewed as an
approximate Maximum a Posteriori approach to our model. Finally, we demonstrate
superior predictive performance relative to the frequentist baseline on a
genetics application, especially when the source data are limited.
