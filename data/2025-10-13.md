method employs a closed-form weighted least squares estimator and enables the
positioning using a single ground station and a cooperative UAV relaying the
signal. Analytical derivations and simulation results demonstrate effectiveness
of the proposed approach, achieving near-optimal performance aligned with the
Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) under moderate Gaussian noise conditions.

*Hao Jiang,Chongjun Ouyang,Zhaolin Wang,Yuanwei Liu,Arumugam Nallanathan,Zhiguo Ding*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文从贝叶斯克拉美罗界角度研究了夹持天线系统的感知极限，分析了单目标和多目标场景下的性能优化问题，提出了两种目标调度协议，并通过数值结果验证了夹持天线系统相比传统固定位置阵列的优越性。

Method: 采用贝叶斯克拉美罗界分析感知性能，提出夹持切换和夹持复用两种目标调度协议，利用KKT条件将功率最小化和最小最大BCRB问题转化为位置搜索问题，并使用逐元素算法求解。

Conclusion: 夹持天线系统具有大规模可重构性优势，动态调整PA位置对优化感知性能至关重要，夹持切换协议在性能鲁棒性和计算复杂度之间存在权衡。

Abstract: The fundamental sensing limit of pinching-antenna systems (PASS) is studied
from a Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB) perspective. Compared to conventional
CRB, BCRB is independent of the exact values of sensing parameters and is not
restricted by the unbiasedness of the estimator, thus offering a practical and
comprehensive lower bound for evaluating sensing performance. A system where
multiple targets transmit uplink pilots to a single-waveguide PASS under a
time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme is analyzed. For the single-target
scenario, our analysis reveals a unique mismatch between the sensing centroid
(i.e., the optimal PA position) and the distribution centroid (i.e., the center
of the target's prior distribution), underscoring the necessity of dynamic PA
repositioning. For the multi-target scenario, two target scheduling protocols
are proposed: 1) pinch switching (PS), which performs separate pinching
beamforming for each time slot, and 2) pinch multiplexing (PM), which applies a
single beamforming configuration across all slots. Based on these protocols,
both the total power minimization problem under a BCRB threshold and the
min-max BCRB problem under a total power constraint are formulated. By
leveraging Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, these problems are equivalently
converted into a search over PA positions and solved using an element-wise
algorithm. Numerical results show that i)~PASS, endowed with large-scale
reconfigurability, can significantly enhance the sensing performance compared
with conventional fixed-position arrays, and ii)~PS provides more robust
performances than PM at the cost of higher computational complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多层级网络中不同系统间复杂交互的表示和分析问题，需要能够定位不同尺度拓扑同调的代数描述符。

Conclusion: CMC框架为多层级复杂网络分析提供了有效的拓扑代数工具，交叉拉普拉斯算子能捕捉不同尺度的拓扑不变量，在信号处理和拓扑学习中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: One of the key challenges in many research fields is uncovering how different
interconnected systems interact within complex networks, typically represented
as multi-layer networks. Capturing the intra- and cross-layer interactions
among different domains for analysis and processing calls for topological
algebraic descriptors capable of localizing the homologies of different
domains, at different scales, according to the learning task. Our first
contribution in this paper is to introduce the Cell MultiComplexes (CMCs),
which are novel topological spaces that enable the representation of
higher-order interactions among interconnected cell complexes. We introduce
cross-Laplacian operators as powerful algebraic descriptors of CMC spaces able
to capture different topological invariants, whether global or local, at
different resolutions. Using the eigenvectors of these operators as bases for
the signal representation, we develop topological signal processing tools for
signals defined over CMCs. Then, we focus on the signal spectral representation
and on the filtering of noisy flows observed over the cross-edges between
different layers of CMCs. We show that a local signal representation based on
cross-Laplacians yields a better sparsity/accuracy trade-off compared to
monocomplex representations, which provide overcomplete representation of local
signals. Finally, we illustrate a topology learning strategy designed to infer
second-order cross-cells between layers, with applications to brain networks
for encoding inter-module connectivity patterns.

### [5] [Enhanced Breakdown and RF Performance in Field-Plated AlGaN/GaN HEMT for High-Power Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09154)

Conclusion: 所提出的栅极场板HEMT适用于恶劣环境下的高压大功率射频应用，具有优异的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) are most suitable for harsh
environments as they operate reliably under extreme conditions such as high
voltages, high temperatures, radiation exposure and corrosive atmospheres. In
this article, gate field-plated engineering Al0.295GaN/GaN HEMT is proposed for
achieving high breakdown voltage to reliably operate in harsh environments. The
Al0.295GaN/GaN heterointerface results in a 2DEG (two-dimensional electron gas)
density of the order of 1013 cm-2 obtained from the self-consistent solution of
Schr\"odinger and Poisson equations. The device has undergone DC and breakdown
simulations which result in threshold voltage of -5.5 V, drain saturation
current of 3000 mA, and breakdown voltage of 1 kV. The HEMT also shows
excellent RF characteristics which include cut-off frequency (ft) of 28 GHz and
maximum frequency of oscillation (fmax) of 38 GHz. The proposed gate
field-plated HEMT is stable up to 40 GHz and suitable for high-voltage and
high-power RF operation during harsh environment applications.

Result: 在合成数据上的实验表明，该方法相比现有方法具有更高的估计精度和更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效学习二维信号的图结构，为分析复杂不规则域中的依赖关系提供了新方法。

Abstract: Graph learning aims to infer a network structure directly from observed data,
enabling the analysis of complex dependencies in irregular domains. Traditional
methods focus on scalar signals at each node, ignoring dependencies along
additional dimensions such as time, configurations of the observation device,
or populations. In this work, we propose a graph signal processing framework
for learning graphs from two-dimensional signals, modeled as matrix graph
signals generated by joint filtering along both dimensions. This formulation
leverages the concept of graph stationarity across the two dimensions and
leverages product graph representations to capture structured dependencies.
Based on this model, we design an optimization problem that can be solved
efficiently and provably recovers the optimal underlying
Kronecker/Cartesian/strong product graphs. Experiments on synthetic data
demonstrate that our approach achieves higher estimation accuracy and reduced
computational cost compared to existing methods.

### [7] [Energy-Efficient Power Control in Single-User M-MIMO-OFDM System with PA Nonlinearity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09232)
*Siddarth Marwaha,Pawel Kryszkiewicz,Eduard A. Jorswieck*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了单用户M-MIMO下行链路系统中考虑非线性功率放大器效应的能效功率分配问题，提出了基于根查找的低复杂度算法来最大化能量效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有M-MIMO资源分配方案大多忽略功率放大器传输功率优化和非线性失真效应的影响，且多数研究假设窄带传输，忽略了OFDM系统中非线性PA产生的子载波互调失真。

Method: 使用软限幅器PA模型建模宽带传输，在瑞利衰落和最大比传输预编码下推导了信号-失真-噪声比的闭式表达式，定义了考虑两种PA架构和失真OFDM信号的能效函数，并提出低复杂度根查找算法进行传输功率调整。

Result: 仿真结果显示，相比固定PA回退基线，在低和高路径损耗下均实现了超过100%的能效增益提升。

Conclusion: 研究发现最优工作点取决于天线数量、PA模型和传播条件，为M-MIMO系统能效优化提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Although multiple works have proposed energy-efficient resource allocation
schemes for Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (M-MIMO) system, most
approaches overlook the potential of optimizing Power Amplifier (PA)
transmission power while accounting for non-linear distortion effects.
Furthermore, most M-MIMO studies assume narrow-band transmission, neglecting
subcarrier intermodulations at the non-linear PA for an Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system. Therefore, this work investigates the
energy-efficient power allocation for a single-user equipment (UE) M-MIMO
downlink (DL) system employing OFDM with nonlinear PAs. Unlike prior works, we
model wide-band transmission using a soft-limiter PA model and derive a
closed-form expression for the signal-to-distortion-and-noise ratio (SNDR)
under Rayleigh fading and Maximal Ratio Transmission (MRT) precoding. Next, the
Energy Efficiency (EE) function is defined considering two PA architectures and
a distorted OFDM signal. We then propose a low complexity root-finding
algorithm to maximize EE by transmit power adjustment. Simulation results
demonstrate significant EE gains over a fixed PA back-off baseline, with over
$100\%$ improvement under both low and high path loss. Our findings reveal how
the optimal operating point depends on the antenna count, the PA model, and the
propagation conditions.

### [8] [Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for PA Distortion-Aware M-MIMO OFDM System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09238)
*Siddarth Marwaha,Pawel Kryszkiewicz,Eduard Jorswieck*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一个联合优化发射功率和激活天线数量的资源分配框架，明确考虑非线性功率放大器的影响，在MU-MIMO-OFDM系统中显著提升能量效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在采用大规模MIMO技术的无线网络中维持高能量效率至关重要，现有方法往往忽略非线性功率放大器的影响，导致性能下降

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案具有显著影响，明确考虑非线性失真能够带来可观的能量效率提升

Abstract: Maintaining high energy efficiency (EE) in wireless networks is crucial,
particularly with the adoption of massive MIMO technology. This work introduces
a resource allocation framework that jointly optimizes transmit power assigned
to each user and the number of active antennas, while explicitly accounting for
a nonlinear Power Amplifier (PA). We consider a downlink MU-MIMO-OFDM
transmission with zero forcing (ZF) precoding, Rayleigh fading channels, and
soft-limiter PAs, with both ideal and realistic PA architectures. In contrast
to existing formulations, our optimization framework avoids imposing an
explicit transmit power constraint, since the nonlinear distortion inherently
limits the feasible operating region. To solve the resulting non-convex
problem, an alternating optimization approach is adopted that, by exploiting
properties of the EE function, guarantees convergence to a stationary point.
Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent performance gains over
distortion-neglecting and power-only optimized baselines. In a scenario of a 5
km radius cell serving 60 randomly distributed users, the median EE gains over
the distortion-neglecting allocation reach 40% for ideal PAs and 20% for Class
B PAs, confirming high impact of the proposed solution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学链路断层扫描(OLT)是一个快速发展的领域，能够从网络端点仅通过处理相干接收器接收的信号来实现光纤链路上光学功率的多维度端到端可视化。本文旨在进行首个OLT现场试验，并扩展其能力以定位和测量多种QoT退化原因。

Abstract: Optical link tomography (OLT) is a rapidly evolving field that allows the
multi-span, end-to-end visualization of optical power along fiber links in
multiple dimensions from network endpoints, solely by processing signals
received at coherent receivers. This paper has two objectives: (1) to report
the first field trial of OLT, using a commercial transponder under standard
DWDM transmission, and (2) to extend its capability to visualize across 4D
(distance, time, frequency, and polarization), allowing for locating and
measuring multiple QoT degradation causes, including time-varying power
anomalies, spectral anomalies, and excessive polarization dependent loss. We
also address a critical aspect of OLT, i.e., its need for high fiber launch
power, by improving power profile signal-to-noise ratio through averaging
across all available dimensions. Consequently, multiple loss anomalies in a
field-deployed link are observed even at launch power lower than the
system-optimal level. The applications and use cases of OLT from network
commissioning to provisioning and operation for current and near-term network
scenarios are also discussed.

Abstract: We present IF-D, a large-scale inertial dataset designed to enable
self-supervised and foundational learning for IMU time series. IF-D comprises
continuous, long-duration multichannel recordings (accelerometer, gyroscope,
magnetometer) sampled at 200Hz using a UM7 IMU mounted inside a 3D-printed
spherical enclosure that promotes diverse, free rotations during vehicle
traversal. The collection spans approximately 135 minutes of recording,
yielding around 1.6 million samples across nine sensor channels. We describe
the data acquisition setup, preprocessing, and calibration procedures
(six-orientation accelerometer calibration, stationary gyroscope bias
estimation, and ellipsoid fitting for magnetometer hard-/soft-iron correction),
and provide quantitative calibration results. IF-D is designed to mitigate
platform specific motion bias and expose models to both physical dynamics and
typical measurement noise, thereby facilitating robust representation learning
and downstream tasks such as event detection, motion mode recognition, and
inertial navigation.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have
emerged as a transformative technology with applications spanning robotics,
virtual reality, medicine, and rehabilitation. However, existing BCI frameworks
face several limitations, including a lack of stage-wise flexibility essential
for experimental research, steep learning curves for researchers without
programming expertise, elevated costs due to reliance on proprietary software,
and a lack of all-inclusive features leading to the use of multiple external
tools affecting research outcomes. To address these challenges, we present
PyNoetic, a modular BCI framework designed to cater to the diverse needs of BCI
research. PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses
the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition
to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and
finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive
and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart
for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal
programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless
integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding,
ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array
of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity
indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation
methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for
both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design
process, allowing researchers to focus on more intricate aspects of BCI
development and thus accelerate their research endeavors. Project Website:

TL;DR: 提出EDS框架，通过基于能量的模型在推理时动态引导LLM隐藏状态，降低误拒绝率同时保持安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前LLM安全对齐技术过度谨慎导致对良性提示误拒绝的问题，目标是同时提升安全性和减少误拒绝

Method: 训练轻量级外部能量模型，在推理时通过能量梯度动态引导LLM隐藏状态到低能量区域，无需微调模型权重

Result: 在ORB-H基准上，合规率从57.3%提升至82.6%，同时保持基线安全性能

Conclusion: EDS提供了一种有效范式，使LLM能够同时实现低误拒绝率和高安全性

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence
models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear
alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives
improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing
remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed
dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as
dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing
their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential
aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical
analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that
eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency
modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements.
Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications
in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This
correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a
principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the
capabilities of sequence models.

### [15] [Inverse-Free Wilson Loops for Transformers: A Practical Diagnostic for Invariance and Order Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08648)
*Edward Y. Chang,Ethan Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WILSON是一个后处理诊断套件，用于检测大语言模型在无害编辑下的答案翻转问题，通过计算内部表示的曲率图和激活级交换器来识别重排序风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在实践中存在答案不稳定的问题：RAG输出在段落重排序时翻转，微调削弱预训练学到的恒定性，推理过程依赖路径，编译器优化扰动决策边界附近的logits。这些违反预期不变性的问题会破坏持续集成，迫使团队在安全性和速度之间权衡。

Method: WILSON结合了基于位置和层的无逆曲率图（使用JVP和Hutchinson探针计算）与激活级交换器来标记重排序风险。这些信号计算成本低，适用于标准Transformer模型，并输出为阈值和CSV文件供编排器使用。

Result: WILSON能够实现具体行动：保护RAG免受顺序效应影响，捕获微调回归，稳定辩论路径和长多轮上下文，以及在部署中控制融合或重排序操作。

Conclusion: WILSON帮助预测故障并批准安全优化，使得可靠性和吞吐量能够共同提升，而无需改变模型架构或训练过程。

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in
practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes
invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take
path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RareNet是一种基于子图的图神经网络，仅需患者表型数据即可识别最可能的致病基因，为罕见遗传病诊断提供高效解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见遗传病诊断面临三大挑战：患者数据不足、全基因组测序难以获取、致病基因数量庞大，导致诊断周期长、治疗不当，尤其在资源有限地区问题更为严重。

Method: 提出RareNet，一种基于子图的图神经网络方法，仅使用患者表型数据来识别致病基因，并检索相关的患者子图用于临床调查。可作为独立方法或与其他候选基因优先级排序方法结合使用。

Result: 在两个生物医学数据集上的综合评估显示，RareNet在致病基因预测方面具有竞争力和鲁棒性，与其他框架集成时能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: RareNet仅需表型数据即可实现复杂遗传分析，为缺乏先进基因组基础设施的服务不足人群提供了可及性，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient
patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of
possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic
journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately
affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are
scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires
only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve
focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can
function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing
filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing
their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through
comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive
and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when
integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is
readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to
sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved
populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

TL;DR: 提出了两种点级方法LD和LCD来处理时间序列预测中的实例内分布偏移问题，通过在不同时间步使用不同参数来消除内部差异，并在多个基准测试中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列具有复杂的非平稳特性，会导致分布偏移，影响模型性能。现有方法未能处理实例内的分布偏移，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出了两种点级方法：学习分布（LD）通过学习输入和输出的内部分布来消除内部差异；学习条件分布（LCD）使用神经网络预测输出的缩放系数。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，使用不同骨干模型评估了两种方法的性能，通过对比实验证明了点级范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 点级方法能够有效处理时间序列预测中的实例内分布偏移问题，LD和LCD方法在不同骨干模型上都表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex
non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution
shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time,
negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization
techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series
forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within
individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle
inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods:
Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD
eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input
and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD
utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We
evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across
public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm
through comparative experiments.

Conclusion: LeFCert是第一个为语言赋能基础模型设计的具有可证明鲁棒性的少样本分类器，有效解决了中毒攻击问题，为实际应用提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据可视化中常用的质量指标对均匀缩放敏感，即使缩放不会实质改变投影的特性，这影响了降维技术评估的准确性。

Method: 通过分析和实证研究尺度对应力和KL散度的影响，提出了使这两种指标尺度不变的简单技术。

Result: 研究表明尺度变化会显著改变质量指标值，提出的尺度不变方法在小基准测试中能准确捕捉预期行为。

Conclusion: 尺度敏感性会影响降维技术评估，提出的尺度不变方法能更准确地评估可视化投影质量。

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究显示线性模型能达到与复杂架构相当的预测性能，但增强线性模型的方法仍未被充分探索。基于不同时间序列实例可能遵循异质线性映射的假设，需要开发更有效的线性模型增强方法。

Method: 采用分类辅助通道独立(CACI)机制动态路由实例到专用预测器，实现监督通道设计；重新设计趋势-季节性分解架构，包含解耦-线性映射-重耦合框架处理趋势分量，以及复数域线性投影处理季节性分量。

Conclusion: CATS-Linear通过分类辅助通道独立和重新设计的分解架构，有效增强了线性模型的预测性能，在固定超参数设置下实现了竞争性的最先进精度。

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting
performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for
enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that
distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we
propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy
against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因组选择方法在处理复杂性状和大数据集时预测精度不足，需要更有效的模型来捕捉复杂的基因型-表型关系。

Method: 使用8维one-hot编码处理SNP数据，按染色体排序，采用PMF算法进行特征选择，集成卷积神经网络和自注意力机制。

Conclusion: DPCformer在精度、小样本稳健性和可解释性方面表现优异，为精准育种和全球粮食安全提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop
phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle
with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose
DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with
a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships.
We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato,
rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP
data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature
selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize
datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved
by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On
small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait
increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by
16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample
scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for
precision breeding and addressing global food security challenges.

TL;DR: 提出了Soft Graph Transformer (SGT)，一种用于MIMO检测的软输入软输出神经网络架构，结合自注意力和图感知交叉注意力，实现近最大似然性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最大似然检测计算复杂度高，传统消息传递算法在有限维度下失效，现有Transformer检测器忽略MIMO因子图结构且无法利用先验软信息。

Method: 结合自注意力（编码符号和约束子图内的上下文依赖）与图感知交叉注意力（在子图间执行结构化消息传递），具有软输入接口以集成辅助先验。

Result: 实验表明SGT实现近最大似然性能，为利用软先验的接收机系统提供灵活可解释的框架。

Conclusion: SGT通过结合图结构和Transformer架构，有效解决了MIMO检测中的计算复杂度和性能平衡问题，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural
architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML)
detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it
infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely
on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent
Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the
MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT
addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes
contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with
graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across
subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors,
producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency.
Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a
flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft
priors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出频率感知缓存(FreqCa)方法，通过分析扩散模型中不同频率分量的动态特性，分别处理低频和高频特征，显著降低扩散变换器的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法假设相邻时间步的特征相似或连续，但这在扩散模型中并不总是成立。通过频域分析发现，低频分量相似度高但连续性差，高频分量连续性好但相似度低，这促使开发更有效的缓存策略。

Method: 提出FreqCa方法：直接重用低频特征（基于相似性），使用二阶Hermite插值器预测高频特征（基于连续性）。同时提出缓存累积残差特征(CRF)而非所有层特征，减少99%内存占用。

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev、FLUX.1-Kontext-dev、Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit等数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法在生成和编辑任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: FreqCa通过频率感知的特征缓存策略，成功解决了扩散变换器推理成本高的问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on
GitHub.

TL;DR: 提出LENS方法改进GRPO算法，通过利用负样本组（没有正确响应的组）来提升强化学习效率，在MATH基准测试中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO算法在处理负样本组时浪费计算资源，因为这些组中没有任何采样响应正确，导致零优势和无效梯度。

Method: 从奖励建模的最大似然目标出发，推导出等价于修改价值函数的策略梯度，为错误响应添加置信度加权的惩罚项，即LENS方法。

Result: 在MATH基准测试中使用Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-3B模型，LENS方法持续优于GRPO基线，在较难项目上获得显著提升。

Conclusion: LENS提供了一种原则性和实用的方法来"拯救"负样本组，提高了RLVR的效率和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

Motivation: 现有ICL均衡器主要针对静态信道设计，缺乏对非平稳时变信道的理论分析和实际应用。本文旨在探索ICL在非平稳问题中的能力，特别是时变信道均衡场景。

Method: 采用原则性框架设计高效的注意力机制，利用自适应信号处理算法指导设计。提出了基于LMS算法、LRMS公式和多步梯度更新的注意力变体，以增强非平稳任务中的适应性。

Result: 实验结果表明ICL在非平稳MIMO均衡中表现出强大潜力，受经典自适应算法启发的注意力机制显著提升了动态环境下的适应性和性能。

Conclusion: ICL在非平稳信道均衡中具有重要应用前景，基于自适应算法的注意力机制设计为开发具有更强适应性和鲁棒性的下一代无线基础模型提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as
frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard
supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

Motivation: 解决黑盒模型在关键决策场景中缺乏可解释性的问题，提高模型的可信度和透明度。

Conclusion: SHAP值聚类是一种有效的可解释AI方法，能够揭示黑盒模型的内部决策机制，增强模型在高风险应用中的可信度。

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

Abstract: Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm
wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes.
This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance
by applying stochastic transformations, which encourages the model to learn

Conclusion: 通过将干扰转化为多原因信号，该框架连接了空间和去混杂文献，推进了结构化数据中的稳健因果推断。

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets

multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures

### [29] [Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08724)
*Ozgur Guldogan,Neeraj Sarna,Yuanyuan Li,Michael Berger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP)方法，通过保护属性干预的对称化来生成反事实公平的预测集，同时保持边际覆盖特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的反事实公平研究主要关注点预测器，而预测集在不确定性下的公平决策中至关重要。同时，保形预测虽然能提供有效的预测集，但不保证反事实公平性。

Method: 通过对保护属性干预的符合度分数进行对称化，开发了CF-CP方法，在保持边际覆盖特性的同时确保预测集的反事实公平性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，CF-CP在回归和分类任务中都能实现所需的反事实公平性，并以最小的预测集大小增加达到目标覆盖率。

Conclusion: CF-CP提供了一种简单、无需训练的路径来实现反事实公平的不确定性量化。

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新颖的频域分析框架，将多臂老虎机问题重新表述为信号处理问题，证明了UCB算法中的置信区间项在频域中等效于对不确定频谱分量施加时变增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分析主要从时域和累积遗憾角度出发，难以刻画学习过程的动态特性，需要新的分析框架来更好地理解探索与利用的权衡。

Method: 构建频域老虎机模型，将每个臂的奖励估计视为频谱分量，其不确定性对应分量频率，将老虎机算法解释为自适应滤波器。

Result: 证明了UCB算法置信区间项在频域中相当于对不确定频谱分量施加时变增益，该增益与访问次数的平方根成反比，并推导了关于探索率衰减的有限时间动态界。

Conclusion: 该理论不仅为经典算法提供了新颖直观的物理解释，还为设计具有自适应参数调整的下一代算法奠定了严格的理论基础。

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most
fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

TL;DR: 本文为大型语言模型推理时内部状态控制技术提供了理论基础，解释了这些干预如何从transformer架构的基本计算中产生，并推导出将文本输入转化为可重用权重更新的原则性方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型行为控制技术虽然有效，但多基于经验启发式方法，缺乏理论支撑。本文旨在为这些干预技术提供数学理论基础。

Method: 基于最近发现提示影响可数学映射为隐式权重更新的理论，将其推广到深度多块transformer架构，推导出将提示信息压缩为token无关的思想向量和思想矩阵的原则性方法。

Result: 开发了理论框架解释现有向量和矩阵模型编辑技术，提供了将文本输入直接转化为可重用权重更新的计算方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为大语言模型内部状态控制技术提供了理论基础，建立了文本输入与权重更新之间的直接数学联系，为模型编辑技术提供了计算基础。

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable
weight updates.

*Yikai Zhao,Jiekai Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个双方法框架，通过替代模型解释和频谱可预测性分析来解决复杂时间序列集成模型的解释性和可预测性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代时间序列预测越来越依赖AutoML系统生成的复杂集成模型，虽然精度高但缺乏透明度和可解释性，需要解决准确性与可解释性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 1) 训练LightGBM替代模型来模拟AutoGluon的时间序列预测，实现稳定的SHAP特征归因；2) 集成频谱可预测性分析，通过比较时间序列的频谱可预测性与纯噪声基准来量化固有可预测性。

Result: 在M5数据集上的实证评估显示，较高的频谱可预测性不仅与改进的预测准确性强相关，还与替代模型和原始预测模型之间的高保真度相关。

Conclusion: 该框架为最先进的集成预测提供了可解释的实例级解释，同时为用户提供了可预测性指标，作为预测及其解释的可靠性指标。

Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models
generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but
with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper
introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the
explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.
First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the
accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic
AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature
attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection
experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP
values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral
predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By
comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise
benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in
forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset
found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with
improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate
and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as
effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to
calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further
demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful
SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The
resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for
state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability
metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their
explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DemoDiff是一个基于演示条件扩散模型的分子设计方法，通过少量分子-评分示例定义任务上下文，在33个设计任务中表现优于大100-1000倍的语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分子设计中上下文学习效果有限的问题，利用ChEMBL等数据库中的分子属性数据，但每个属性的标记数据稀缺。

Method: 使用演示条件扩散模型，通过少量分子-评分示例指导去噪Transformer生成符合目标属性的分子；开发了节点对编码的分子标记器，在基序级别表示分子；在包含数百万上下文任务的数据集上预训练7亿参数模型。

Result: 在6个类别的33个设计任务中，DemoDiff匹配或超越大100-1000倍的语言模型，平均排名3.63，优于领域特定方法的5.25-10.20。

Conclusion: DemoDiff作为分子基础模型，为上下文分子设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our

Motivation: 现有异常检测方法在处理混合类型表格数据时存在语义信息丢失和缺乏可解释性的问题，无法准确识别导致异常的具体值。

Method: 将异常检测重构为特征条件重构问题，为每个特征训练条件随机森林；使用调整后的Gower距离进行单元格级评分，结合不确定性加权平均生成行级异常分数。

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular
data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种控制优化确定性等价(OCE)风险的方法，扩展了传统的共形风险控制框架，能够处理尾部风险，并引入了端到端的共形风险训练方法以提升平均性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型虽然预测准确率高，但缺乏可证明的风险或可靠性保证，这在高风险应用中至关重要。传统共形风险控制只能控制期望损失，无法处理对尾部风险敏感的实际应用。

Method: 开发了控制OCE风险类的方法，包括条件风险价值(CVaR)等尾部风险度量；引入了端到端的共形风险训练，在模型训练或微调期间通过共形OCE风险控制进行反向传播。

Result: 方法在控制分类器假阴性率和电池储能操作金融风险的应用中，相比后处理方法显著提升了平均性能，同时保持了可证明的风险保证。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够为深度学习模型提供可证明的风险保证，特别是针对尾部风险，并通过端到端训练改善了平均性能，适用于高风险应用场景。

Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their
predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or
reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The
framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free,
finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习记忆化检测技术一次只关注一个样本，低估了跨样本记忆化的风险，而集中式学习的细粒度记忆化评估方法无法直接应用于联邦学习。

Method: 提出了一个框架，使用细粒度跨样本记忆化测量来量化联邦学习中的客户端内部和客户端间记忆化，并研究了解码策略、前缀长度和联邦学习算法等关键因素。

Result: 发现联邦学习模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内部数据比客户端间数据更容易被记忆，记忆化程度受到训练和推理因素的影响。

Conclusion: 联邦学习存在记忆化风险，需要更细粒度的检测方法，记忆化程度受多种因素影响，客户端内部数据比客户端间数据更容易被记忆。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOTION是一个用于量化优化的平滑框架，通过随机舍入噪声的期望来近似量化损失表面，保证标准优化器收敛到局部最小值，并在语言模型上表现优于标准QAT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络面临根本性挑战，因为量化器是分段常数函数，除了量化阈值处导数未定义外，其他地方梯度为零。现有方法如STE缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 受Nesterov平滑启发，提出LOTION框架，用无偏随机舍入噪声下的期望损失替代原始量化损失，创建连续可微的损失表面。

Result: 在合成测试集和150M/300M参数语言模型上的实验表明，该方法优于标准量化感知训练(QAT)。

Conclusion: LOTION提供了一个有理论保证的量化优化框架，能够保持原始量化损失的全局最小值，同时确保标准优化器的收敛性。

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

Motivation: 传统CT协议优化方法需要穷举参数组合，计算成本高且不实用，需要更高效的优化方法

Method: 使用虚拟成像工具模拟CT成像，结合PPO强化学习算法优化管电压、管电流、重建核、层厚和像素大小等参数，以最大化肝脏病灶的可检测性指数

Result: 强化学习方法在所有测试案例中都达到了全局最大d'值，比穷举搜索减少了79.7%的计算步骤

Conclusion: 虚拟成像工具与强化学习结合为CT协议管理提供了准确且计算高效的优化框架，具有很好的应用潜力

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

Conclusion: 量纲分析为增强RL策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力提供了强大实用的工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本嵌入模型通常只处理原始文本，忽略了现实数据中丰富的结构信息（如超链接、引用等），而这些结构信息在许多应用中提供了关键上下文。

Method: 研究了两种主要的内部处理方法：顺序连接和并行缓存，并针对噪声结构数据问题提出了上下文蒸馏和语义平衡两种有效技术。

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

Motivation: RL智能体在稀疏奖励环境中难以发现有效动作序列，而LLM具有程序性知识和推理能力，但现有方法要么强制RL策略遵循LLM建议，要么将其直接纳入奖励函数，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 通过增强观察空间提供LLM生成的动作推荐，允许RL智能体学习何时遵循或忽略指导，利用LLM的世界知识和推理能力，同时通过软约束保持灵活性。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的BabyAI环境中，LLM指导的益处随任务难度增加而增强。在最挑战的环境中，最终成功率相对基线提升71%，样本效率提升高达9倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用LLM的规划能力来加速RL在挑战性环境中的训练，无需修改现有RL算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward
environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover
effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural
knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL
exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL
policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward
functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action
recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to
learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world
knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft
constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of
increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with
task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative
improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides
substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance
thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL
algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM
planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

Conclusion: 基于初始化的策略为可扩展和模块化的神经函数逼近提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the
advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such
models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires
training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to
architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently
generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function
pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to
approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned
parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target
functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further
introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference
domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained
models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings
demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization,
and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based
strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full
code is made publicly available on Gitee.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多臂老虎机问题中欺骗性智能体的最优策略，该智能体在观察者的监督下试图识别最佳私有臂而不被发现，通过KL散度约束确保行为不被察觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多臂老虎机设置中，智能体需要在观察者的监督下（观察者期望智能体遵循公共奖励的Thompson采样）识别最佳私有臂，同时避免被检测到欺骗行为。

Method: 将可检测性形式化为智能体实际拉臂概率与观察者预期拉臂概率之间的逐步KL散度约束，将公共次优臂的成功拉动建模为伯努利过程，并提出了受top-two算法启发的自适应探索算法。

Result: 在KL约束下，公共次优臂的拉动最多以Θ(√T)的速率发生，提出了基于公共和私有均值的极大极小问题，其解刻画了最佳私有臂识别的最优错误指数。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能够根据公共次优性差距自适应调整探索策略，数值实验验证了Θ(√T)速率和算法的有效性。

Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a
private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson
Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to
quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can
observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.
The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We
formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the
anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of
public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability
decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at
a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin
problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the
optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose
an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts
its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public
suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the
$\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: PO-CKAN是一个基于分块有理Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(KANs)的物理信息深度算子框架，用于近似偏微分方程的解算子，相比PI-DeepONet在Burgers方程上减少约48%的相对L2误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够高效学习物理一致的时空解算子，并快速预测参数化时间相关PDE的框架，解决传统方法在处理变化输入(如参数、初始/边界条件)时的效率问题。

Method: 采用DeepONet分支-主干架构，子网络实例化为有理KAN模块，通过PDE残差(PINN风格)损失强制物理一致性，结合物理信息神经网络原理与算子学习框架。

Result: 在Burgers方程(ν=0.01)上，PO-CKAN相比PI-DeepONet减少约48%的平均相对L2误差；在Eikonal和扩散-反应基准测试中达到竞争性精度。

Conclusion: PO-CKAN框架能够准确学习算子，结果与高保真解高度匹配，为参数化时间相关PDE的高效求解提供了有效方法。

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on
Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the
solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages
a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise
Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function
approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are
integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical
consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically
consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction
for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters,
initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark
problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely
matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk
architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and
enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers'
equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by
approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy
on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

Result: 建立了TAPAS数据集创建文档，设定了攻击性能基准，并为未来工作指明了方向。

Conclusion: TAPAS数据集填补了AI研究LWE攻击的数据空白，为加速该领域研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math
problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform "classical" attacks
on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach,
a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and
improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and
compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap
and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a
Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These
datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI
practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents
TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out
directions for future work.

TL;DR: 提出了Edu-EmotionNet框架，用于在线教育中的情感识别，通过动态跨模态注意力对齐、模态重要性估计和时间反馈循环来提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感识别方法依赖静态融合策略并假设模态输入始终可靠，这在真实学习环境中很少成立，需要更鲁棒的方法来理解学习者的情感状态。

Method: 包含三个关键组件：跨模态注意力对齐模块用于动态跨模态上下文共享，模态重要性估计器为每个时间步的模态分配基于置信度的权重，时间反馈循环利用先前预测来增强时间一致性。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MOSEI的教育子集上评估，重新标注了困惑、好奇、无聊和沮丧等情感，取得了最先进的性能，并对缺失或噪声模态表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 可视化证实了模型捕捉情感转换和自适应优先可靠信号的能力，使其非常适合部署在实时学习系统中。

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

Motivation: 探索资源效率高的小型语言模型在图结构推理任务中的潜力，因为目前大多数研究关注大型语言模型，而小型模型的潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 引入TinyGraphEstimator数据集，评估多个小型开源模型预测图参数的能力，并应用LoRA技术进行轻量级微调。

Result: 通过LoRA微调在所有评估指标上实现了持续改进，证明小型语言模型在图结构数据上具有非平凡的推理能力。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型能够有效进行图结构推理，通过高效的参数调优可以适应结构推断任务。

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

Motivation: 现实世界数据分布通常存在不平衡（长尾）问题，这导致深度分类模型偏向频繁类别，对尾部类别表现不佳。

Method: 第一阶段从信息论角度提出新的表示学习技术，理论上等同于最小化类内距离；第二阶段开发新的采样策略，选择数学上信息丰富的实例来修正多数类偏见的决策边界。

Result: 该方法在各种长尾基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并通过广泛实验验证。

Conclusion: 所提出的两阶段学习方法有效缓解了多数类偏见，同时保持了模型的整体性能。

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via
extensive experiments. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的边缘资源管理框架能够在不稳定和资源受限的边缘环境中实现可靠的多视角3D重建，为关键边缘应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: FairTTE是首个用于评估医学影像中时间到事件预测公平性的综合框架，涵盖多种成像模态和TTE结果，揭示当前公平性方法在医学图像预后中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习公平性研究主要关注医学图像诊断任务，忽视了预后场景中的公平性问题，特别是时间到事件预测中的潜在偏见。

Method: 开发FairTTE框架，整合先进的TTE预测和公平性算法，利用因果分析技术识别和量化医学影像数据集中的偏见来源。

Result: 大规模评估显示偏见在不同成像模态中普遍存在，现有公平性方法缓解效果有限，分布偏移下公平性更难维持。

Conclusion: 需要针对所有偏见形式的整体方法，以及更稳健、公平的预后模型来解决医学图像预后中的公平性挑战。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

TL;DR: 本文分析了自监督对比学习(CL)与负样本监督对比学习(NSCL)在表示层面的对齐性，证明在共享随机性条件下它们的表示保持相似，而参数空间则可能发散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有理论表明CL损失近似于NSCL损失，但尚不清楚两者在训练过程中的表示层面是否保持对齐，而不仅仅是目标函数层面的相似。

Method: 在共享随机性条件下训练CL和NSCL模型，分析它们的表示相似性矩阵，并证明在现实条件下这些矩阵保持接近。同时分析参数空间的不稳定性。

Result: 证明CL和NSCL的表示相似性矩阵在现实条件下保持接近，提供CKA和RSA对齐度量的高概率保证。参数空间可能随时间指数级发散。

Conclusion: NSCL可作为自监督与监督学习之间的理论桥梁，CL-NSCL对齐性随规模、温度增加而增强，NSCL比其他监督目标更接近CL。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

TL;DR: 提出自适应时间掩码(ATM)方法解决稀疏自编码器训练中的特征吸收问题，通过动态调整特征选择来学习更稳定的可解释特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前稀疏自编码器训练方法存在特征吸收问题，特征相互吸收以最小化L1惩罚，导致难以一致识别和分析模型行为。

Method: 引入ATM方法，通过跟踪激活幅度、频率和重构贡献来计算随时间演化的重要性分数，基于统计阈值应用概率掩码机制进行特征选择。

Result: 在Gemma-2-2b模型上的实验表明，ATM相比TopK和JumpReLU SAEs方法显著降低了吸收分数，同时保持了优秀的重构质量。

Conclusion: ATM为学习稳定、可解释的神经网络特征提供了原则性解决方案，为更可靠的模型分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

Result: 发现三个视觉通路的组件响应特征存在明显差异，标准视觉DNN与腹侧通路的对齐度高于背侧和外侧通路。

Conclusion: SCA方法能更精确地揭示大脑与DNN的表征对齐关系，对理解神经调谐的潜在轴具有敏感性。

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational
simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of
a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a
Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper
introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active
learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the
intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher
predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于乐观DEC的方法只能处理随机环境，无法扩展到对抗环境。需要一种既能处理随机又能处理对抗环境的统一方法，同时缩小现有遗憾边界的差距。

Method: 引入Dig-DEC，通过纯信息增益驱动探索而非乐观主义。改进了在线函数估计过程，包括平均估计误差最小化和贝尔曼完备MDP中的平方误差最小化。

Result: Dig-DEC总是小于或等于乐观DEC，在特殊情况下更小。在混合MDP中获得了首个模型自由的遗憾边界。改进的估计器将遗憾边界从T^{3/4}提升到T^{2/3}（在线）和从T^{5/6}提升到T^{7/9}（离线）。在贝尔曼完备MDP中，遗憾边界从T^{2/3}提升到√T。

Conclusion: Dig-DEC提供了一种统一的框架来处理随机和对抗环境，解决了Liu等人（2025）留下的主要开放问题，并在多个场景中显著改进了遗憾边界。

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from
$T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves
performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie
et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.

exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM和DDPG的双路径优化方法，解决车联网SPS中因数据包碰撞和车速相关信道不确定性导致的AoI恶化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决车联网半持续调度中数据包碰撞和车速相关信道不确定性导致的年龄信息恶化问题。

Method: 建立受车速、车辆密度和资源预留间隔影响的AoI计算模型，设计双路径优化方案：DDPG基于状态空间和奖励函数进行指导，LLM利用上下文学习生成最优参数配置。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM在积累少量样本后无需模型训练即可显著降低AoI，而DDPG方法在训练后能实现更稳定的性能。

Conclusion: LLM和DDPG的双路径优化方法能有效改善车联网中的AoI性能，LLM具有快速部署优势，DDPG提供稳定性能。

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对小地球数据的时空预测方法，通过量化时空模式并利用表格基础模型实现跨场景的准确预测，相比传统方法具有更好的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型需要针对不同场景进行特定训练，而基础模型存在对预训练分布全局均值的预测偏差问题，需要一种简单鲁棒的方法来处理小地球数据的时空预测。

Method: 通过表征和量化小地球数据的时空模式，然后利用表格基础模型进行跨场景的准确预测。

Result: 在三个典型场景的比较中，该方法在大多数情况下比图深度学习模型（T-GCN）和表格基础模型（TabPFN）实现了更优的准确性，表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为小地球数据的时空预测提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案，能够克服传统方法的局限性，实现跨场景的准确预测。

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs在处理多尺度问题时表达能力有限，静态域分解方法需要大量超参数调优且容易陷入局部最小值。

Method: 采用动态域分解策略，让子域根据解的内在特征自适应调整，并在高残差区域动态添加新子域，提供额外的表达能力。

Result: 数值实验表明AB-PINNs能有效解决各种复杂多尺度偏微分方程问题。

Conclusion: AB-PINNs提供了一种灵活的域分解方法，特别适合多尺度问题，能减少超参数调优需求并避免局部最小值。

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

*Moyu Zhang,Yun Chen,Yujun Jin,Jinxin Hu,Yu Zhang,Xiaoyi Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的测试时优化范式MATT，通过特征组合置信度引导生成多个推理路径，缓解低置信度特征对预测的影响，提升CTR模型预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注训练阶段的优化，忽视了推理阶段的优化机会。不常出现的特征组合会降低预测性能，导致不可靠或低置信度的输出。

Method: 1. 引入分层概率哈希方法估计不同阶特征组合的出现频率作为置信度分数；2. 使用置信度分数作为采样概率，通过迭代采样生成多个实例特定的推理路径；3. 聚合多个路径的预测分数进行鲁棒预测。

Result: 广泛的离线实验和在线A/B测试验证了MATT在现有CTR模型上的兼容性和有效性。

Conclusion: MATT能够解锁已训练CTR模型的预测潜力，通过测试时优化显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and
effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

TL;DR: 提出了Meta-Policy Controller (MPC)框架，通过元学习动态调整KL散度系数和Dirichlet先验强度，解决传统EDL方法在动态数据分布下校准不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EDL方法使用静态超参数进行不确定性校准，在动态数据分布下适应性差，导致高风险决策任务中校准和泛化性能不佳。

Method: 采用双层优化：内层通过动态配置的损失函数更新模型参数；外层使用策略网络基于多目标奖励优化KL散度系数和类别特定的Dirichlet先验强度。

Result: 实验结果表明MPC显著提升了模型预测的可靠性和校准性，改善了不确定性校准、预测准确率以及基于置信度样本剔除后的性能保持。

Conclusion: MPC框架通过动态元学习机制有效解决了传统EDL方法的局限性，实现了更优的不确定性建模和预测可靠性。

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据存在非平稳行为、机制转换和时间变化噪声，这些因素会降低标准回归模型的鲁棒性。

Method: VARNN在传统前馈预测器基础上增加学习的误差记忆状态，该状态从短上下文步长的残差中更新，作为变异性和漂移的信号，并用于调节当前时间步的最终预测。

Result: 在多个领域数据集上的实验表明，VARNN在漂移和波动环境下实现了优越性能，相比静态、动态和循环基线模型获得了更低的测试MSE，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: VARNN模型在漂移和波动环境下提供鲁棒预测，显示出作为时间序列学习框架的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

Method: 提出LAGA多智能体框架，包含四个协作智能体：检测、规划、行动和评估。行动智能体采用双编码器和三目标设计，捕捉跨模态互补信息并进行整体图质量增强。

Result: 在九个场景下的实验表明，LAGA显著提升了图质量，并在各种任务和骨干网络上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的质量优化是实现可靠文本属性图和鲁棒图学习的关键。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that
combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide
range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical
study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant
degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and
imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing
approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting
systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in
practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph
Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a
first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative
agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed
loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective
design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform
holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that
LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as
key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

Abstract: Learning with high-resource data has demonstrated substantial success in
artificial intelligence (AI); however, the costs associated with data
annotation and model training remain significant. A fundamental objective of AI
research is to achieve robust generalization with limited-resource data. This
survey employs agnostic active sampling theory within the Probably
Approximately Correct (PAC) framework to analyze the generalization error and
label complexity associated with learning from low-resource data in both
model-agnostic supervised and unsupervised settings. Based on this analysis, we
investigate a suite of optimization strategies tailored for low-resource data
learning, including gradient-informed optimization, meta-iteration
optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms
that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer,
reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we
conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and
highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional
latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture

Motivation: 探索学习优化器是否能够学习正则化效果，挑战传统显式正则化的必要性。

Method: 通过标准基准测试（MNIST、FMNIST、CIFAR）和神经网络（MLP、MLP-Relu、CNN），比较有/无显式正则化的学习优化器性能。

Result: 正则化学习优化器在测试精度和泛化能力上始终优于未正则化版本，并能将正则化效果迁移到新优化任务中。

Conclusion: 学习优化器能够内在地学习正则化特性，质疑了传统显式正则化的必要性。

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due
to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization.
Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization
techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware
Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to
enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental
question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that
LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional
regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective
function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
(including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and
CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.
Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in
terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain
and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by
inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our
results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties,
\textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss
regularization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR依赖标注样本限制了数据扩展，而RLIR在无标注设置下虽然能持续扩展但性能和稳定性较差，主要原因是模型对高置信度轨迹的过度奖励导致的系统偏差。

Method: 提出RLER方法：1）集成多个模型聚合奖励；2）自适应奖励插值；3）轨迹选择策略。通过三个偏差指标(ρ_noise、ρ_selfbias、ρ_symbias)分析系统偏差。

Result: RLER相比RLIR提升13.6%，仅比RLVR低3.6%，在无标注样本上实现了稳定的扩展。

Conclusion: RLER有效缓解了RLIR的系统偏差问题，实现了接近RLVR的性能，在无标注设置下具有高度适用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

Motivation: 癫痫预测需要大量EEG数据，但标注成本高且涉及隐私问题。联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但在现实场景中由于患者间差异导致性能不稳定。

Method: 提出FedL2T框架，采用双教师知识蒸馏策略：每个客户端同时从全局聚合模型和动态分配的同伴模型学习；使用自适应多级蒸馏对齐预测输出和特征表示；引入近端正则化增强训练稳定性。

Result: 在两个EEG数据集上的实验表明，FedL2T始终优于最先进的联邦学习方法，特别是在低标签条件下表现更佳，且收敛快速稳定，减少了通信轮次和开销。

Conclusion: FedL2T为隐私敏感的医疗场景中的癫痫预测提供了一个可靠且个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

Motivation: 现有推理方法如CoT、ToT等在复杂多步规划中难以确保计划符合用户意图和符号约束，容易产生不可行动作或幻觉步骤。

Method: 使用(intent, constraint)对作为结构化先验，压缩搜索空间并确保有效性，将Const-o-T集成到MCTS中，通过约束剪枝不可行分支并引导探索语义有效动作。

Conclusion: Const-o-T为约束引导推理提供了可泛化的基础，使LLM能够进行更高效、约束对齐和领域自适应的规划。

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code
and tutorials are available at github.com/amai-gsu/PlatformX.

### [71] [SQS: Bayesian DNN Compression through Sparse Quantized Sub-distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08999)
*Ziyi Wang,Nan Jiang,Guang Lin,Qifan Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的贝叶斯变分学习框架SQS，同时进行剪枝和低比特量化，相比现有方法实现了更高的压缩率且性能损失相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常单独进行权重剪枝或低比特量化，导致压缩率不理想。需要统一框架同时处理这两种压缩技术。

Method: 使用spike-and-slab先验诱导稀疏性，采用高斯混合模型建模量化权重以实现低比特精度，通过贝叶斯变分学习统一处理剪枝和量化。

Result: 在ResNet、BERT-base、Llama3和Qwen2.5模型上的实验表明，该方法比现有方法获得更高压缩率，同时保持可比的性能下降。

Conclusion: SQS框架成功实现了同时剪枝和量化的统一处理，在保持性能的同时显著提高了神经网络压缩率。

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

*Changsheng Wang,Yihua Zhang,Dennis Wei,Jinghan Jia,Pin-Yu Chen,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在噪声遗忘数据集下的大语言模型遗忘问题，发现即使遗忘数据被扰动或质量较低，只要核心语义信号保留，遗忘过程仍能保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中遗忘数据往往是低质量、合成改写或带有水印的，而现有遗忘方法假设访问干净、定义明确的遗忘数据，这引发了遗忘可靠性的担忧。

Method: 系统性地在噪声遗忘集上对最先进的LLM遗忘方法RMU和NPO进行基准测试，并提出基于显著性的解释框架来分析遗忘鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现遗忘对扰动具有惊人的鲁棒性，只要核心语义信号得以保留。关键语义组件在表面形式变化时仍保持一致的遗忘影响力。

Conclusion: 遗忘算法主要受深层语义线索而非浅层词汇模式引导，这解释了在噪声遗忘数据下遗忘过程的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

*Rui Bu,Haofeng Zhong,Wenzheng Chen,Yangyan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Value-State Gated Attention (VGA)机制，通过基于值向量的可学习门控来打破注意力与值状态之间的恶性循环，有效缓解极端token现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构中的极端token现象（如注意力汇聚和值状态流失）会降低模型性能、量化保真度和可解释性，这些问题的根源在于注意力与值状态之间的相互强化机制。

Method: VGA引入基于值向量的可学习数据依赖门控，直接调节注意力输出，通过理论分析证明这种基于值状态的门控比基于输入嵌入的门控更有效。

Result: 实验表明VGA显著减轻了注意力汇聚的形成，稳定了值状态范数，提升了模型性能、量化鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: VGA提供了一种简单、专用且稳定的架构机制，通过直接打破注意力与值状态之间的恶性循环，有效解决了极端token问题。

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to
extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Slim Scheduler是一个混合调度框架，结合PPO强化学习和贪心调度器，用于可瘦身模型的分布式推理调度，实现延迟、能耗和准确性的权衡优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络调度研究主要关注固定宽度的静态端到端模型，忽视了适应异构硬件和动态运行时条件的动态方法。

Method: 采用分层设计：本地贪心调度器处理请求批处理和实例扩展，PPO路由器学习全局路由策略（设备选择、宽度比例、批配置），降低搜索空间复杂度。

Result: 相比随机任务分配基线，在降至最瘦模型（70.3%准确率）时，平均延迟减少96.45%，能耗减少97.31%；在提高准确率时也能降低平均延迟和能耗，但延迟和能耗的标准差更高。

Conclusion: 该混合调度框架能有效平衡效率和吞吐量，适应异构硬件环境，实现准确性、延迟和能耗的多目标优化。

Abstract: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on optimizing static,
end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to
heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions. We present Slim
Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy
schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each
server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and
manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the
PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio,
and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space
complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency
and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline,
Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A
96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage
dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then
accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with
an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said
latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

TL;DR: MagicDock是一个用于从头配体设计的框架，通过梯度反演和可微分表面建模解决现有方法的局限性，在蛋白质和分子配体设计中相比最先进方法分别提升27.1%和11.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有从头配体设计方法存在的三个主要问题：伪从头设计、有限的对接建模和僵化的配体类型限制，这些限制了方法在生物医学应用中的实际效果。

Method: 采用梯度反演框架，将受体和配体的对接知识融入主干模型，通过结合预测实例化为反向梯度流来迭代指导配体生成；强调可微分表面建模，使用可学习的3D点云表示精确捕捉结合细节；为不同配体类型定制设计并集成到统一的梯度反演框架中。

Result: 在9个场景的广泛实验中，MagicDock相比专门用于蛋白质或分子配体设计的最先进基线方法，分别实现了27.1%和11.7%的平均提升。

Conclusion: MagicDock通过创新的梯度反演框架和可微分表面建模，有效解决了从头配体设计中的关键挑战，为生物医学应用提供了强大且灵活的解决方案，并获得了理论保证和实验验证。

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or
molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and
achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了近十年AI系统训练的环境影响，发现即使采用优化策略，机器学习模型训练的环境影响仍在指数级增长，存在回弹效应，仅靠效率提升无法确保可持续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习性能提升，计算需求激增导致能源消耗和环境问题日益严重，需要评估现有优化策略是否能实现可持续的ML模型训练。

Method: 通过估算过去十年中包括大语言模型在内的著名AI系统训练的环境影响，重点关注显卡全生命周期的分析。

Result: 发现显卡生产影响持续增加，ML模型训练能耗和环境影响呈指数增长，优化策略无法抵消训练带来的影响，存在回弹效应。

Conclusion: 仅提高效率无法确保ML可持续性，需要减少AI活动、质疑资源密集型训练的规模和频率，并考虑硬件全生命周期而非仅使用阶段的影响。

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

TL;DR: 该论文批评当前语言模型防御评估方法的缺陷，提出应使用自适应攻击者进行测试，并通过系统优化方法成功绕过了12种最新防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型防御评估方法存在缺陷，通常使用静态攻击集或弱优化方法，无法真实反映防御能力。需要更强大的攻击方法来验证防御的鲁棒性。

Method: 系统调整和扩展通用优化技术（梯度下降、强化学习、随机搜索和人工引导探索），针对12种不同技术的最新防御进行攻击。

Result: 成功绕过了12种防御中的大多数，攻击成功率超过90%，而大多数防御原本报告的攻击成功率接近零。

Conclusion: 未来的防御工作必须考虑更强的攻击方法，如本文所述，才能做出可靠且令人信服的鲁棒性声明。

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

TL;DR: 本文从反向视角出发，假设优化器收敛到任意点，研究不同优化器作为特征值滤波器的行为。研究发现梯度下降天然避免最尖锐的极小值，而SAM算法更积极地偏好宽盆地。基于此提出了两种增强特征值滤波的新算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习训练中多种优化器都能找到接近全局最优解，本文从收敛到任意点的假设出发，研究优化器作为特征值滤波器的本质特性，特别是它们在边缘稳定性现象中的作用。

Method: 采用广义Hadamard-Perron稳定流形定理，分析一般半代数C²函数，无需额外非退化条件或全局Lipschitz边界假设。提出两种增强特征值滤波的新算法。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，标准梯度下降天然避免最尖锐极小值，SAM算法更积极地偏好宽盆地。新提出的算法能更有效地促进宽极小值。

Conclusion: 不同优化器本质上作为特征值滤波器运行，其行为由超参数决定。这一视角为理解优化器选择提供了新见解，并启发了更有效的算法设计。

Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a
variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we
adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is
assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption.
From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability
phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue
filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard
gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively
favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel
algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting
wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron
stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions,
without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz
bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on
feed-forward neural networks.

<details>

Motivation: 深度强化学习在自动驾驶中表现出色，但对对抗攻击的脆弱性阻碍了实际部署。现有鲁棒方法存在三个关键问题：对抗短视攻击、难以引发真正安全关键事件、以及训练不稳定和策略漂移。

Method: IGCARL包含战略目标对抗者和鲁棒驾驶智能体。对抗者利用DRL的时序决策能力执行战略协调的多步攻击，采用一般和博弈目标诱导安全关键事件。智能体通过与对抗者交互学习鲁棒策略，并在约束条件下优化以确保学习稳定性。

Result: 实验表明IGCARL比现有最优方法的成功率至少提高27.9%，展现出对对抗攻击的优越鲁棒性，增强了DRL自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: IGCARL通过战略对抗攻击和约束学习框架，有效解决了自动驾驶DRL策略的鲁棒性问题，为实际部署提供了更安全可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,
highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such
as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular
utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid
stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a
spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional
Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in
Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather
conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV
infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons,
clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour)
forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with
1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows
disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee,
reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape
model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of
data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both
sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

Result: 通过分割预处理，AUC-ROC指标从0.8599（PCA和LSTM集成）显著提升至0.9760（随机森林和XGBoost）。

Conclusion: 分割技术能够减少时间模糊性，促进监督算法的学习过程，在工业异常检测中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes
within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal
and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection
(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

TL;DR: FLToP CTC是一种基于帧级token剪枝的CTC解码算法，通过动态剪除低概率token来减少计算和内存需求，在LibriSpeech上实现10.5倍运行速度提升和2.78倍内存减少，同时保持WER性能几乎不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTC-based ASR系统在资源受限环境中面临计算和内存瓶颈，传统CTC解码器需要消耗高达90%的处理时间，效率低下主要源于详尽的token级操作。

Method: 提出帧级token剪枝方法(FLToP CTC)，采用基于相对阈值概率的帧级token剪枝策略，动态消除每帧中的低概率token。

Result: 在LibriSpeech数据集上，FLToP CTC相比标准CTC解码器实现了10.5倍的运行速度提升和2.78倍的内存减少，同时WER退化可忽略不计。

Conclusion: FLToP CTC解决了CTC瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境和实时应用提供了可扩展性，提高了语音识别的可访问性和效率。

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in
resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of
processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face
inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces
Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP
CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided
by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability
tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while
maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a
10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders.
Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms
(CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability
for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech
recognition accessibility and efficiency.

Motivation: 神经生理记录（如EEG）产生高维、嘈杂的时间序列数据，通常需要大量预处理和手工特征提取。现有方法难以有效解码和解释生物信号。

Method: 提出BioCodec框架，受神经编解码器启发，将生物信号的低级特征捕获为离散标记。在数千小时EEG数据上预训练，适用于多种生物信号。

Conclusion: BioCodec为生物信号标记化提供了通用解决方案，性能与最先进模型相当，并适用于多种生物信号类型。

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

TL;DR: 提出AdaPM自适应训练策略，使用部分动量实现内存高效优化器，通过非均匀动量设计和偏置校正技术，在保持性能的同时减少90%以上动量内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练中动量被广泛使用但存储动量存在内存挑战，需要开发内存高效的优化器。

Method: 采用非均匀动量设计，对大多数块不使用完整动量，通过偏置校正技术增强部分动量以减轻性能损失。

Result: 经验验证表明，该方法在60M到1.5B语言模型预训练、监督微调和RLHF中减少90%以上动量内存，同时保持效率和性能，结合二阶统计量技术可进一步减少95%优化器状态内存，为GPT-2 1.5B预训练节省30%以上GPU小时。

Conclusion: AdaPM通过自适应部分动量策略有效解决了动量存储的内存瓶颈，在保持训练性能的同时显著提升了内存效率。

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

TL;DR: 提出MemLoss方法，利用先前生成的对抗样本来增强模型鲁棒性，同时保持干净数据的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法在提高模型鲁棒性时往往会牺牲在干净数据上的准确率，需要一种平衡的方法

Method: 使用先前生成的对抗样本（记忆对抗样本）在多个训练周期中进行训练，实现自然准确率和对抗鲁棒性的平衡提升

Result: 在CIFAR-10等多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有对抗训练方法获得了更好的准确率，同时保持了对攻击的强鲁棒性

Conclusion: MemLoss通过利用记忆对抗样本，有效提升了模型的对抗鲁棒性而不损害自然准确率

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach called MemLoss to improve the
adversarial training of machine learning models. MemLoss leverages previously
generated adversarial examples, referred to as 'Memory Adversarial Examples,'
to enhance model robustness and accuracy without compromising performance on
clean data. By using these examples across training epochs, MemLoss provides a
balanced improvement in both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness.
Experimental results on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, demonstrate that
our method achieves better accuracy compared to existing adversarial training
methods while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的成员推理游戏来高效审计数据记录的近似最坏情况隐私风险，并改进了DP-SGD算法，通过自适应组特定梯度裁剪策略来减少组隐私风险差异，提升差分隐私机器学习中的隐私保护公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要基于数据记录的平均隐私风险评估组隐私风险，这可能低估组隐私风险及其差异。同时，当前评估最坏情况隐私风险的方法耗时较长，限制了实际应用。

Method: 引入新的成员推理游戏来高效审计近似最坏情况隐私风险；改进标准DP-SGD算法，采用自适应组特定梯度裁剪策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能更严格地测量组隐私风险，可靠评估组隐私风险差异；改进的算法有效减少了组隐私风险差异。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够提升差分隐私机器学习中隐私保护的公平性，通过更准确的组隐私风险评估和有效的风险差异减少策略。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了具有延迟反馈的上下文多臂老虎机问题，提出了在有限策略类和一般函数逼近设置下的遗憾最小化算法，并建立了相应的遗憾上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实世界的在线学习场景中，反馈往往不是即时获得的，而是存在延迟。本文旨在解决在对抗性延迟反馈下的上下文多臂老虎机问题，为延迟反馈环境提供有效的学习算法。

Method: 对于有限策略类，直接使用策略类进行学习；对于一般函数逼近设置，使用在线最小二乘回归预言机。特别地，提出了一种基于Hedge的Vovk聚合预测器的稳定性分析作为预言机实现。

Result: 在有限策略类下获得了最优期望遗憾界O(√(KT log|Π|) + √(D log|Π|))；在一般函数逼近设置下获得了O(√(KTℛ_T(O)) + √(d_max D β))的遗憾界，其中通过稳定性分析将β限制为log|F|，得到O(√(KT log|F|) + √(d_max D log|F|))的遗憾界。

Conclusion: 本文为延迟反馈下的上下文多臂老虎机问题提供了有效的算法框架，在有限策略类下达到了最优遗憾界，在一般函数逼近设置下获得了接近下界的遗憾界，仅相差√d_max因子。

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是专家知识获取和从人类反馈中学习，通过成对比较来估计复杂的多元信念密度。

Method: 方法包括：将目标密度与温度调节的胜者密度关联，通过得分匹配学习胜者得分，提出温度场的估计器，使用基于得分缩放的退火Langevin动力学生成温度样本，训练扩散模型。

Result: 结果表明，该方法能够仅使用数百到数千个成对比较，就能学习模拟专家的复杂多元信念密度。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法有效地建立了信念密度和胜者密度之间的关系，通过温度调节和去温度调节过程实现了从成对比较中进行密度估计。

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of
pairwise comparisons.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Logits Replay + MoClip两阶段框架，通过压缩logit空间的监督信号和稳定优化更新，在提升领域性能的同时减轻通用能力遗忘，并降低40%以上的训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在领域适应中面临的权衡问题：提升专业领域性能往往以牺牲通用能力为代价。现有方法在计算、数据访问或适应性方面成本高昂。

Method: 两阶段框架：Stage 0记录覆盖概率阈值的动态Top-K token子集（包含正确标签）；Stage 1重放这些紧凑子集计算精确重归一化损失，避免完整softmax计算。MoClip优化器限制梯度-动量旋转并应用基于arctan2的更新重缩放。

Result: 在通信技术(CT)和NL2SQL任务上提升领域性能，同时在通用基准(MMLU、BBH、GPQA、MATH)上减轻遗忘，训练成本降低超过40%。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs的领域适应提供了一条可扩展、架构无关的路径，无需牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path
for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

TL;DR: Agentic-KGR是一个通过多轮强化学习实现LLM与知识图谱协同进化的框架，解决了传统知识增强LLM中静态知识库的覆盖不足和时效性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前知识增强的大语言模型依赖静态、预构建的知识库，存在覆盖差距和时间过时问题，限制了在动态信息环境中的有效性。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1）动态模式扩展机制，在训练期间系统扩展图本体；2）检索增强记忆系统，通过持续优化实现模型参数与知识结构的协同进化；3）可学习的多尺度提示压缩方法，通过自适应序列优化减少计算复杂度。

Result: 实验结果显示在知识提取任务中显著优于监督基线和单轮RL方法。与GraphRAG集成后，在下游QA任务中表现出优越性能，在准确性和知识覆盖方面相比现有方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: Agentic-KGR框架通过LLM与知识图谱的协同进化，有效解决了传统知识增强方法的局限性，在动态信息环境中展现出更好的性能。

Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static,
pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个系统性基准来比较EHR表示方法，包括多变量时间序列、事件流和文本事件流，发现在不同临床场景下事件流模型表现最佳，且特征选择策略需要根据临床环境进行调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于评估实践不一致，电子健康记录(EHR)中患者数据的最佳表示方法仍不明确，需要系统性的基准来比较不同表示方法。

Method: 创建标准化基准，在MIMIC-IV和EHRSHOT数据集上评估三种EHR表示范式：多变量时间序列(使用Transformer、MLP、LSTM、Retain)、事件流(使用CLMBR和基于计数的模型)、文本事件流(使用8-20B LLMs)，并分析基于数据缺失的特征修剪影响。

Result: 事件流模型始终提供最强性能；预训练模型如CLMBR在少样本设置中样本效率高；特征选择策略需适应临床环境：修剪稀疏特征改善ICU预测，但保留这些特征对纵向任务至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过统一可复现的流程，研究结果为基于临床环境和数据制度选择EHR表示提供了实用指导，事件流是最有效的表示方法。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

TL;DR: 提出了WASI方法，通过将训练限制在固定子空间内，显著降低Transformer模型的内存占用和计算成本，同时保持与标准训练相当的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的应用日益广泛，能耗和数据隐私成为紧迫问题。设备端学习虽然能降低能耗和保护隐私，但现代神经网络规模扩大成为主要障碍。

Method: 应用基于子空间的训练方法到Transformer模型，提出Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration (WASI)，通过将训练限制在模型关键信息所在的固定子空间内，缓解反向传播的内存瓶颈。

Result: WASI在保持与标准训练相当准确率的同时，内存使用减少高达62倍，计算成本(FLOPs)降低高达2倍。在Raspberry Pi 5上，训练和推理速度比标准训练快约1.5倍。

Conclusion: WASI方法有效解决了设备端训练的内存和计算瓶颈，为在资源受限的边缘设备上部署Transformer模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

Method: 提出了分层模型融合方案，与标准MergeMany算法进行比较，并测试了Re-Basin对模型鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 分层融合方案显著优于标准算法，Re-Basin能增强模型的对抗性和扰动鲁棒性，且参与融合的模型越多效果越强，但会导致比预期更大的性能下降。

Conclusion: Git Re-Basin虽然能提升模型鲁棒性，但实际性能损失比原作者报告的要大，需要谨慎使用。

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach
to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that
significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new
algorithm, we find that Re-Basin induces adversarial and perturbation
robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more
models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our
experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by
the original authors.

Motivation: 传统功能性脑网络建模依赖局部成对交互，无法捕捉高阶依赖关系；现有超图建模方法计算负担重且依赖启发式方法，难以实现端到端学习。

Method: 提出全局约束导向的多分辨率（GCM）框架，整合4种全局约束（信号同步、被试身份、期望边数、数据标签）来学习4个不同分辨率水平（样本/被试/组/项目）的脑网络结构。

Result: 在5个数据集和2种任务设置中，相比9个基线和10个最先进方法，GCM实现相对准确率提升30.6%，计算时间减少96.3%。

Conclusion: GCM为功能性脑网络结构学习提供了新视角，为认知神经科学的跨学科应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise
interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and
heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end
learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this,
we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and
implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN
structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint
(signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data
labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels
(sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results
demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy
and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task
settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight
the interpretability of GCM. This work offers a novel perspective on FBN
structure learning and provides a foundation for interdisciplinary applications
in cognitive neuroscience. Code is publicly available on

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures
deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference
across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct
rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is

Motivation: 理解持续学习中灾难性遗忘的深层原因，现有方法未能完全解决这个问题。作者发现新任务训练会通过前向和后向传播导致对抗性对齐，从而快速增加旧任务损失。

Method: 通过理论分析揭示灾难性遗忘的机制，提出backGP方法来缓解后向传播导致的对抗性对齐问题。该方法是对现有梯度投影(GP)方法的改进。

Result: backGP方法在平均上比GP方法减少了10.8%的遗忘，提高了12.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 灾难性遗忘的根本原因是新任务训练作为对抗性攻击，通过前向和后向传播导致梯度与旧任务损失尖锐方向对齐。backGP方法能有效缓解这一问题。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in
machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose
underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this
paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task
training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.
Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with
the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the
old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive
because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by
chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's
low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the
two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.
Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of
forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward
propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We
propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves
accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法仅限于文本，限制了多模态大语言模型的全部潜力，因此需要扩展到多模态空间。

Method: 提出多模态提示优化器(MPO)，通过保持对齐的联合更新来优化多模态提示，并利用贝叶斯选择策略指导候选提示的选择。

Result: 在图像、视频甚至分子等多种模态上的实验表明，MPO优于领先的纯文本优化方法。

Conclusion: 多模态提示优化是实现多模态大语言模型潜力的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升了学习效率、泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在从次优专家数据学习时表现突出

Conclusion: 通过分离表达能力和在线学习，实现了高效稳定的策略学习，为复杂分布建模与在线强化学习的结合提供了有效方案

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的化学反应预测模型虽然预测成功，但缺乏透明度和可解释性，需要开发能够解释预测结果的方法。

Method: 引入了质蕴涵解释的新表述，并提出了在小规模反应预测任务中计算此类解释的算法。

Result: 初步实验表明，质蕴涵解释保守地捕捉了真实解释，虽然常包含冗余的键和原子，但一致地捕获了预测反应可行性的关键分子属性。

Conclusion: 质蕴涵解释方法能够有效识别化学反应预测中的关键分子特征，为模型可解释性提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions
have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive
success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We
introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as
minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm
for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

Conclusion: 提出的时间感知数据共享框架能有效激励早期参与，满足公平性和个体理性要求。

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Motivation: 金融机器学习模型容易受到模型漂移的影响，特别是在中亚和高加索等发展中经济体，这些地区频繁且不可预测的宏观经济冲击会破坏金融数据的稳定性。目前对这些地区金融数据集漂移缓解方法的研究较少。

Method: 研究采用合成异常值的方法来提高模型对不可预见冲击的稳定性，并引入了一个两级评估框架来衡量性能下降程度和冲击严重性。

Result: 在宏观经济表格数据集上的实验表明，添加少量合成异常值通常能提高模型稳定性，但最佳添加比例因数据集和模型而异。

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift,
where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue
is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and
the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

Motivation: 传统Modelica模型中的代数环会导致仿真效率低下，且存在多解问题，需要一种高效且稳定的替代方法。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络，在损失函数中直接使用代数环的残差进行训练，无需监督数据，并确保收敛到一致解。

Result: 在IEEE 14-Bus系统上，仿真时间减少60%，同时通过误差控制机制保持相同精度水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了代数环的仿真效率和多解问题，为大规模系统仿真提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for
replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network
surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)
of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a
supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous
solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather
than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus
system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to
conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through
error control mechanisms.

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

Result: 证明了黑盒安全对齐的可行性，为资源受限环境提供了可扩展的安全保障途径

Conclusion: 该框架为各种利益相关者提供了在快速发展的LLM生态系统中实施安全的可行方案

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

Motivation: 标准评估指标往往无法反映人类偏好，而人类评估虽然更可靠但成本高且噪声大。现有Bradley-Terry方法要么忽略评分者变异性，要么缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 提出BBQ方法，使用贝叶斯框架显式建模评分者质量，通过期望最大化算法提供单调似然收敛保证，对不可靠参与者进行降权或移除。

Result: BBQ实现了更快的收敛速度、良好校准的不确定性估计，以及相比基线Bradley-Terry模型更稳健、可解释的排名，即使在有噪声或众包评分者的情况下也表现良好。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现更可靠和成本效益高的生成模型人类评估。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

Method: 开发了两阶段自回归图注意力网络(GAT)模型，将系统表示为运营事件(到达和出发)的时空图，并包含平台和车站拥堵等细粒度特征。

Result: 虽然提出的GATv2模型在纯误差指标(MAE)上被更简单的持续性基线挑战，但在延误事件分类精度上始终表现更高，这对于可靠的决策支持工具至关重要。

Conclusion: 该框架为实时列车延误预测提供了可行的解决方案，特别在延误事件分类精度方面具有优势，适合作为决策支持工具部署。

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern
economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.
Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for
real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap
remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive
forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,
interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses
this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,
explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a
two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a
real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model
represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events
(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including
platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the
model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting
protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can
compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is
challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it
achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial
advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

Method: 应用完整高斯-牛顿预条件处理到transformer模型，并与层式GN预条件器进行对比，评估不同预条件方法的性能。

Result: 完整GN更新相比SOAP和Muon等强基线实现5.4倍训练迭代减少；层式GN预条件器几乎匹配完整GN方法的性能。

Conclusion: GN近似对预条件处理非常有效，高阶损失项对收敛速度可能不关键；层式Hessian结构包含足够信息实现大部分潜在收益；当前近似方法与理想层式oracle存在显著性能差距。

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，HINT在不同规模模型上均优于现有方法，取得了最先进的结果，同时展现出更稳定的学习和更高的数据效率。

Conclusion: HINT框架通过改善训练亲和力，有效解决了复杂推理任务中的RL训练挑战，为增强LLM的长链推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs)
to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute
outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and
systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that
makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination
coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by
impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from
approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a
common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures
softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new
model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design
principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby
identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation,
geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for
numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several
insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains
empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for
systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for
wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections
introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter
identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in
extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by
receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise
transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and
receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel
noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the
RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is
particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,
as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance
degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to
cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer
to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing
domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware
signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver
changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a
10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了权重初始化对神经网络训练的影响，包括ReLU多层感知机和GPT-2风格transformer，发现了稳定的初始化范围，比较了不同初始化方法的性能，并观察到transformer层间权重方差的深度依赖性变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 权重初始化在训练开始时控制信号传播和梯度流动，对训练稳定性和收敛速度有重要影响。本文旨在通过理论和实验研究，连接经典初始化原则与现代transformer行为，为稳健训练提供实用指导。

Method: 采用对数扫描初始标准差的方法识别稳定区域，比较Kaiming和Xavier初始化在ReLU网络中的表现，并在12层GPT-2风格模型中追踪Q/K/V权重方差在预训练期间的变化。

Result: 发现1e-2到1e-1标准差范围内存在广泛的稳定性带；Kaiming初始化比Xavier在ReLU网络中收敛更快更稳定；transformer浅层权重方差快速扩展，深层变化更渐进，形成窄带均衡。

Conclusion: 研究结果连接了经典初始化原理与现代transformer行为，为稳健训练提供了简单实用的初始化策略，特别是在深度网络中保持层间权重方差平衡的重要性。

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the
start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically
validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and
GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard
deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability
band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled
comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more
stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory.
Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks
layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent
equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper
layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic
initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple,
practical recipes for robust training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线随机匹配问题中，由于缺乏结构假设导致计算最优匹配是NP难的问题，通过引入单峰偏好结构来克服计算障碍。

Method: 使用基于PQ树的顺序近似方法，开发了高效的离线预算匹配算法，并将其转化为在线算法。对于已知单峰结构的情况，设计了类似UCB的算法。

Result: 对于未知单峰结构的情况，算法遗憾界为O(UKT^{2/3})；对于已知结构的情况，遗憾界为O(U√(TK))。

Conclusion: 单峰偏好结构使得在线随机匹配问题变得可计算，提出的算法在已知和未知偏好结构的情况下都能实现高效的在线学习。

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm
sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解交叉注意力在跨域序列推荐中的工作机制，超越传统的残差对齐观点。

Method: 通过300多次实验分析交叉注意力机制，发现正交对齐现象，即查询输入与交叉注意力输出正交时性能最佳。

Result: 正交对齐能自然提升缩放定律，带有交叉注意力模块的基线模型在参数匹配条件下获得更优的准确率-参数比。

Conclusion: 正交对齐为多模态研究中的参数高效缩放提供了新方向，交叉注意力的两种对齐机制可以共存于推荐模型中。

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了均匀缩放流(USFs)统一了深度单类分类和密度估计两种异常检测范式，通过理论分析表明USFs训练等价于带特殊正则化的Deep SVDD目标，既能保持密度估计的忠实性又具备距离推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督异常检测存在两种主要范式：深度单类分类(如Deep SVDD)学习正常数据的紧凑潜在表示，而密度估计器(如归一化流)直接建模正常数据的似然。本文旨在建立这两种方法的理论联系。

Method: 提出均匀缩放流(USFs)，即具有常数雅可比行列式的归一化流。通过理论证明USFs的最大似然训练等价于Deep SVDD目标加特殊正则化，防止表示坍塌。将USFs作为现代异常检测架构中非USFs的即插即用替代品。

Result: 实验表明，在多个基准测试和模型骨干上，USFs替代非USFs能带来一致的性能提升和显著改善的训练稳定性，适用于图像级和像素级检测。USFs在负对数似然和潜在范数之间诱导了更紧密的对齐。

Conclusion: USFs统一了异常检测的两大主要范式，既推进了理论理解又提升了实际性能，建议在异常检测架构中使用USFs作为非USFs的替代方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

TL;DR: 本文研究AI控制协议中的自适应攻击，发现基于LLM监控器的现有协议存在根本性漏洞，攻击者通过嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入可一致性地规避监控器完成恶意任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI控制协议主要依赖LLM监控器作为防御机制，但将其视为安全单点故障。研究在攻击者了解协议和监控器模型的情况下，如何通过自适应攻击绕过这些控制机制。

Method: 实例化简单自适应攻击向量，攻击者在模型输出中嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入，利用监控器的漏洞。特别分析了Defer-to-Resample协议的反效果。

Result: 前沿模型在两个主要AI控制基准测试中一致性地规避了多样化监控器并完成恶意任务。攻击对当前依赖监控器的协议具有普遍有效性，Defer-to-Resample协议甚至会产生反效果。

Conclusion: 对监控模型的自适应攻击代表了当前控制协议的主要盲点，应成为未来AI控制机制评估的标准组成部分。

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Abstract: This study develops an interpretable machine learning framework to forecast
startup outcomes, including funding, patenting, and exit. A firm-quarter panel
for 2010-2023 is constructed from Crunchbase and matched to U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) data. Three horizons are evaluated: next funding

initial public offering (IPO) or acquisition within 36 months. Preprocessing is
fit on a development window (2010-2019) and applied without change to later

weights and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Nominal and
Continuous features (SMOTE-NC). Logistic regression and tree ensembles,
including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are compared using
the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) and the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Patent, funding, and exit
predictions achieve AUROC values of 0.921, 0.817, and 0.872, providing

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

Result: 在MEPS区域数据集上，CRPS-LAM的采样速度比扩散模型快39倍，同时匹配了扩散模型的低误差水平，并保留了精细尺度预报细节。

Conclusion: CRPS-LAM是概率区域天气预报的有效方法，在保持预报质量的同时显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble
methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown
strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally
expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather
forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS),
we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a
CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector
into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

Motivation: 现有工作主要关注全局极小极大最优性，而本文从局部视角出发，研究在固定分布P0邻域内的采样问题，这更符合实际应用中存在公共数据分布的场景。

Method: 将先前工作从纯LDP扩展到功能性LDP框架，证明全局最优功能性LDP采样器在约束到P0邻域分布时也是局部最优采样器，并推导出局部极小极大最优采样器的闭式表达式。

Result: 确定了局部极小极大风险的确切值，该值取决于P0和隐私水平，且局部最优采样器在公共数据场景下始终优于全局极小极大采样器。

Conclusion: 局部框架自然建模了带公共数据的私有采样问题，局部最优采样器在实际应用中表现优于全局方法，为LDP下的采样提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population
is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney
function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney
damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are
crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning
models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an
enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector
nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction
capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%
accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and

Abstract: Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which
is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37
years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,
Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both
regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental
monitoring and decision-making.

Automation (PETRA). It applies evolutionary optimization to model architecture
and training strategy. PETRA includes pruning, quantization, and loss
regularization. Experimental studies on real-world data with financial event
sequences, as well as image and time-series -- benchmarks, demonstrate PETRA's
ability to improve neural model performance and scalability -- namely, a
significant decrease in model size (up to 75%) and latency (up to 33%), and an
increase in throughput (by 13%) without noticeable degradation in the target
metric.

### [128] [STaTS: Structure-Aware Temporal Sequence Summarization via Statistical Window Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09593)
*Disharee Bhowmick,Ranjith Ramanathan,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaTS是一个轻量级的无监督框架，用于结构感知的时间序列摘要，通过自适应压缩时间序列为紧凑的标记序列，实现高达30倍的序列压缩，同时保留核心时间动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据通常包含潜在的时间结构、局部平稳状态间的转换、重复模式和变异性爆发，这些在标准表示学习流程中很少被利用。现有模型通常在原始或固定窗口序列上操作，将所有时间步视为同等信息量，导致效率低下、鲁棒性差和在长或噪声序列中可扩展性有限。

Method: STaTS使用基于BIC的统计差异准则检测多个时间分辨率的变化点，然后使用简单函数（如均值）或生成模型（如GMM）总结每个片段。该框架作为模型无关的预处理器，可以与现有的无监督时间序列编码器集成而无需重新训练。

Result: 在150多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，STaTS能够实现85-90%的完整模型性能，同时显著降低计算成本。此外，STaTS在噪声下提高了鲁棒性，并保留了判别结构，优于均匀和基于聚类的压缩基线。

Conclusion: STaTS为高效、结构感知的时间序列建模提供了一个原则性的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

*Nathan Quiblier,Roy Friedman,Matthew Ricci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MODE（混合动态专家）框架，通过神经门控机制将复杂动态分解为稀疏可解释组件，能够无监督发现行为机制并在机制转换间进行准确长期预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生命科学中的动态系统常包含重叠行为机制的复杂混合，传统基于流的方法假设局部平滑动态，难以处理机制间噪声和不规则转换。

Method: MODE采用图形建模框架，通过神经门控机制将复杂动态分解为稀疏可解释组件，允许代理跳转到不同控制规律，特别适合处理噪声转换。

Result: 在合成和真实计算生物学数据集上验证：在无监督分类任务中表现优异，在挑战性预测任务中成功模拟细胞生物学关键循环和分支过程，在单细胞RNA测序数据中能区分增殖与分化动态并预测细胞命运承诺时间。

Conclusion: MODE框架能有效处理复杂动态系统中的行为机制发现和跨机制预测，在计算生物学中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.

*Sangyun Lee,Brandon Amos,Giulia Fanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaNEL算法仅使用失败样本进行后训练，通过建模失败模式来引导生成远离已知错误，在稀疏奖励任务中显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成模型在困难任务中面临的两个问题：(1)基础模型获得接近零的奖励信号，(2)奖励函数调用成本高昂

Method: 将学习失败规律建模为另一个生成建模问题，利用该模型评估新数据是否类似已知失败并引导生成远离这些模式

Result: 在多个稀疏奖励任务中，BaNEL无需观察成功样本即可提升模型性能，比现有新颖性奖励方法成功率高出数个数量级，且使用更少的奖励评估

Conclusion: BaNEL能够有效处理稀疏奖励环境中的学习挑战，通过负样本学习实现模型改进

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.

*Morris Trestman,Stefan Gugler,Felix A. Faber,O. A. von Lilienfeld*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: GGFPS是一种基于梯度引导的最远点采样方法，通过利用分子力范数来改进分子构型空间的采样效率，相比传统FPS和均匀采样具有更好的数据效率和预测鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统FPS方法在分子构型空间采样中系统性地低估平衡几何结构的问题，导致对松弛结构预测误差大，需要开发更有效的训练集选择方法。

Method: 提出GGFPS方法，在传统FPS基础上引入分子力范数作为指导，通过梯度信息优化采样过程，更有效地覆盖构型空间。

Result: 在Styblinski-Tang函数和MD17数据集上的实验表明：GGFPS相比FPS可减少高达两倍的训练成本而不牺牲精度；在MD17中系统性地降低了平衡和应变结构的预测误差；显著降低了所有构型空间的预测误差方差。

Conclusion: 梯度感知采样方法作为有效的训练集选择工具具有巨大潜力，而单纯使用FPS可能导致训练不平衡和预测结果不一致。

Abstract: Smart training set selections procedures enable the reduction of data needs
and improves predictive robustness in machine learning problems relevant to
chemistry. We introduce Gradient Guided Furthest Point Sampling (GGFPS), a
simple extension of Furthest Point Sampling (FPS) that leverages molecular
force norms to guide efficient sampling of configurational spaces of molecules.
Numerical evidence is presented for a toy-system (Styblinski-Tang function) as
well as for molecular dynamics trajectories from the MD17 dataset. Compared to
FPS and uniform sampling, our numerical results indicate superior data
efficiency and robustness when using GGFPS. Distribution analysis of the MD17
data suggests that FPS systematically under-samples equilibrium geometries,
resulting in large test errors for relaxed structures. GGFPS cures this
artifact and (i) enables up to two fold reductions in training cost without
sacrificing predictive accuracy compared to FPS in the 2-dimensional
Styblinksi-Tang system, (ii) systematically lowers prediction errors for
equilibrium as well as strained structures in MD17, and (iii) systematically
decreases prediction error variances across all of the MD17 configuration
spaces. These results suggest that gradient-aware sampling methods hold great
promise as effective training set selection tools, and that naive use of FPS
may result in imbalanced training and inconsistent prediction outcomes.

Result: 经验评估显示，该方法在合成数据集上达到了与现有最先进核方法相当的预测精度，同时显著提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: 提出的新型表示定理为多元霍克斯过程触发核估计提供了一种高效的非参数方法，能够更好地处理大规模数据。

Abstract: The representer theorem is a cornerstone of kernel methods, which aim to
estimate latent functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) in a
nonparametric manner. Its significance lies in converting inherently
infinite-dimensional optimization problems into finite-dimensional ones over
dual coefficients, thereby enabling practical and computationally tractable
algorithms. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the latent
triggering kernels--functions that encode the interaction structure between
events--for linear multivariate Hawkes processes based on observed event
sequences within an RKHS framework. We show that, under the principle of
penalized least squares minimization, a novel form of representer theorem
emerges: a family of transformed kernels can be defined via a system of
simultaneous integral equations, and the optimal estimator of each triggering
kernel is expressed as a linear combination of these transformed kernels
evaluated at the data points. Remarkably, the dual coefficients are all
analytically fixed to unity, obviating the need to solve a costly optimization
problem to obtain the dual coefficients. This leads to a highly efficient
estimator capable of handling large-scale data more effectively than
conventional nonparametric approaches. Empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets reveal that the proposed method attains competitive predictive
accuracy while substantially improving computational efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art kernel method-based estimators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准对数障碍镜像映射会导致重尾对偶分布，产生病态动力学；高斯先验在匹配重尾目标时表现不佳。

Result: 提供了理论保证，包括速度场的空间Lipschitz性和时间正则性、Wasserstein收敛率等。在合成凸域模拟中优于基线方法，在现实约束生成任务中达到竞争性样本质量。

Conclusion: Mirror Flow Matching方法有效解决了凸域生成建模中的基本挑战，在理论和实验上都表现出色。

Abstract: We study generative modeling on convex domains using flow matching and mirror
maps, and identify two fundamental challenges. First, standard log-barrier
mirror maps induce heavy-tailed dual distributions, leading to ill-posed
dynamics. Second, coupling with Gaussian priors performs poorly when matching
heavy-tailed targets. To address these issues, we propose Mirror Flow Matching
based on a \emph{regularized mirror map} that controls dual tail behavior and
guarantees finite moments, together with coupling to a Student-$t$ prior that
aligns with heavy-tailed targets and stabilizes training. We provide
theoretical guarantees, including spatial Lipschitzness and temporal regularity
of the velocity field, Wasserstein convergence rates for flow matching with
Student-$t$ priors and primal-space guarantees for constrained generation,
under $\varepsilon$-accurate learned velocity fields. Empirically, our method
outperforms baselines in synthetic convex-domain simulations and achieves
competitive sample quality on real-world constrained generative tasks.

Conclusion: 明确建模对抗性不确定性具有显著优势，贝叶斯框架为对抗性防御提供了统计严谨的理论基础。

Abstract: The vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks remains a
critical security challenge. Traditional defenses, such as adversarial
training, typically robustify models by minimizing a worst-case loss. However,
these deterministic approaches do not account for uncertainty in the
adversary's attack. While stochastic defenses placing a probability
distribution on the adversary exist, they often lack statistical rigor and fail
to make explicit their underlying assumptions. To resolve these issues, we
introduce a formal Bayesian framework that models adversarial uncertainty
through a stochastic channel, articulating all probabilistic assumptions. This
yields two robustification strategies: a proactive defense enacted during
training, aligned with adversarial training, and a reactive defense enacted
during operations, aligned with adversarial purification. Several previous
defenses can be recovered as limiting cases of our model. We empirically
validate our methodology, showcasing the benefits of explicitly modeling
adversarial uncertainty.

TL;DR: 提出了一种因果自回归缓冲区方法，将上下文编码与条件集更新解耦，使基于Transformer的概率模型能够高效生成联合分布，同时保持集合条件化的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的摊销概率推理模型擅长单次边际预测，但许多实际应用需要捕获预测间依赖关系的联合分布。纯自回归架构能生成联合分布但牺牲了集合条件化的灵活性，而标准方法需要昂贵的重复编码。

Method: 引入因果自回归缓冲区，模型一次性处理并缓存上下文，动态缓冲区捕获目标依赖关系：当目标被纳入时，它们进入缓冲区并关注缓存的上下文和先前缓冲的目标。

Result: 在合成函数、EEG信号、认知模型和表格数据上，该方法与强基线预测准确性相当，同时提供高达20倍的联合采样速度提升。

Conclusion: 该方法将自回归生成模型的效率与基于集合条件化的表示能力相结合，使基于Transformer的概率模型的联合预测变得实用。

Abstract: Transformer-based models for amortized probabilistic inference, such as
neural processes, prior-fitted networks, and tabular foundation models, excel
at single-pass marginal prediction. However, many real-world applications, from
signal interpolation to multi-column tabular predictions, require coherent
joint distributions that capture dependencies between predictions. While purely
autoregressive architectures efficiently generate such distributions, they
sacrifice the flexible set-conditioning that makes these models powerful for
meta-learning. Conversely, the standard approach to obtain joint distributions
from set-based models requires expensive re-encoding of the entire augmented
conditioning set at each autoregressive step. We introduce a causal
autoregressive buffer that preserves the advantages of both paradigms. Our
approach decouples context encoding from updating the conditioning set. The
model processes the context once and caches it. A dynamic buffer then captures
target dependencies: as targets are incorporated, they enter the buffer and
attend to both the cached context and previously buffered targets. This enables
efficient batched autoregressive generation and one-pass joint log-likelihood
evaluation. A unified training strategy allows seamless integration of
set-based and autoregressive modes at minimal additional cost. Across synthetic
functions, EEG signals, cognitive models, and tabular data, our method matches
predictive accuracy of strong baselines while delivering up to 20 times faster
joint sampling. Our approach combines the efficiency of autoregressive
generative models with the representational power of set-based conditioning,
making joint prediction practical for transformer-based probabilistic models.

Abstract: Real-world clinical problems are often characterized by multimodal data,
usually associated with incomplete views and limited sample sizes in their
cohorts, posing significant limitations for machine learning algorithms. In
this work, we propose a Bayesian approach designed to efficiently handle these
challenges while providing interpretable solutions. Our approach integrates (1)
a generative formulation to capture cross-view relationships with a
semi-supervised strategy, and (2) a discriminative task-oriented formulation to
identify relevant information for specific downstream objectives. This dual
generative-discriminative formulation offers both general understanding and
task-specific insights; thus, it provides an automatic imputation of the
missing views while enabling robust inference across different data sources.
The potential of this approach becomes evident when applied to the multimodal
clinical data, where our algorithm is able to capture and disentangle the
complex interactions among biological, psychological, and sociodemographic
modalities.

Abstract: We propose a generative multivariate posterior sampler via flow matching. It
offers a simple training objective, and does not require access to likelihood
evaluation. The method learns a dynamic, block-triangular velocity field in the
joint space of data and parameters, which results in a deterministic transport
map from a source distribution to the desired posterior. The inverse map, named
vector rank, is accessible by reversibly integrating the velocity over time. It
is advantageous to leverage the dynamic design: proper constraints on the
velocity yield a monotone map, which leads to a conditional Brenier map,
enabling a fast and simultaneous generation of Bayesian credible sets whose
contours correspond to level sets of Monge-Kantorovich data depth. Our approach
is computationally lighter compared to GAN-based and diffusion-based
counterparts, and is capable of capturing complex posterior structures.
Finally, frequentist theoretical guarantee on the consistency of the recovered
posterior distribution, and of the corresponding Bayesian credible sets, is
provided.
