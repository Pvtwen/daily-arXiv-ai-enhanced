Abstract: Recently, Wi-Fi signals have emerged as a powerful tool for contactless sensing. During the sensing process, obtaining target direction information can provide valuable contextual insights for various applications. Existing direction estimation methods typically rely on antenna arrays, which are costly and complex to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present WiRainbow, a novel approach that enables single-antenna-based direction awareness for Wi-Fi sensing by leveraging the dispersion effect of frequency-scanning antennas (FSAs), which can naturally steer Wi-Fi subcarriers toward distinct angles during signal transmission. To address key challenges in antenna design and signal processing, we propose a coupled-resonator-based antenna architecture that significantly expands the narrow Field-of-View inherent in conventional FSAs, improving sensing coverage. Additionally, we develop a sensing signal-to-noise-ratio-based signal processing framework that reliably estimates target direction in multipath-rich environments. We prototype WiRainbow and evaluate its performance through benchmark experiments and real-world case studies, demonstrating its ability to achieve accurate, robust, and cost-effective direction awareness for diverse Wi-Fi sensing applications.

*Khuram Naveed,Naveed ur Rehman*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出完全多变量MFDFA方法，结合MVMD预处理，用于多通道机器振动数据的故障诊断，能有效区分健康与故障状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MFDFA方法无法充分捕捉多通道振动数据中的跨通道依赖关系和方差偏差，需要开发能更好表征多变量信号多尺度结构的方法。

Method: 引入基于马氏距离的协方差加权Lpq矩阵范数定义完全多变量波动函数，结合多变量变分模态分解(MVMD)进行故障相关分量分离。

Result: 在风力涡轮机齿轮箱数据上的实验表明，该方法优于传统MFDFA方法，即使在噪声条件下也能有效区分机器健康与故障状态。

Conclusion: 提出的FM-MFDFA框架为多通道机器振动数据提供了一种有效的故障诊断方法，能更好地捕捉多变量信号的复杂结构特征。

Abstract: We propose a fully multivariate generalization of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) and leverage it to develop a fault diagnosis framework for multichannel machine vibration data. We introduce a novel covariance-weighted $L_{pq}$ matrix norm based on Mahalanobis distance to define a fully multivariate fluctuation function that uniquely captures cross-channel dependencies and variance biases in multichannel vibration data. This formulation, termed FM-MFDFA, allows for a more accurate characterization of the multiscale structure of multivariate signals. To enhance feature relevance, the proposed framework integrates multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) to isolate fault-relevant components before applying FM-MFDFA. Results on wind turbine gearbox data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional MFDFA approaches by effectively distinguishing between healthy and faulty machine states, even under noisy conditions.

### [3] [Wavelet-Guided Water-Level Estimation for ISAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20936)
*Ayoob Salari,Kai Wu,Khawaja Fahad Masood,Y. Jay Guo,J. Andrew Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于LTE下行功率指标的被动式低成本水位监测方法，利用连续小波变换提取潮汐特征，结合轻量级神经网络实现高精度水位跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统水位监测方法依赖固定仪器，成本高且易受极端天气影响，需要一种低成本、易部署的替代方案。

Method: 使用商用接收器报告的LTE下行功率指标（RSRP、RSSI、RSRQ），通过连续小波变换提取半日潮分量，形成潮汐特征，结合轻量级神经网络进行水位预测，支持多基站协作融合。

Result: 在420米河流路径实验中，视距条件下RMSE为0.8cm，MAE为0.5cm；非视距条件下经过微调后RMSE为1.7cm，MAE为0.8cm。

Conclusion: 该方法无需阵列校准，可在标准硬件上运行，相比基于CSI的方法更实用，多基站融合可进一步提高鲁棒性，适合大规模部署。

Abstract: Real-time water-level monitoring across many locations is vital for flood response, infrastructure management, and environmental forecasting. Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical. When signals from multiple base stations are available, fusion further improves robustness.

Abstract: Current rehabilitation of lower limb prostheses has significant challenges, especially with skin conditions, irritation and discomfort. Understanding the skin temperature and having comfortable wearable sensors that would monitor skin temperature in a real-time outdoor environment would be useful. The system would help the user and orthopedic technician to provide feedback and changes that might be required in the prosthesis. Hence in this paper, a series of experiments are conducted in order to understand and characterize the system behavior and compare a general thermistor and a modified thermistor as a potential method of temperature measurement for outdoor usage of prostheses. The paper goes on to compare the different modified thermistors behavior with their regular counterpart and highlights the challenges and improvement areas needed for such a modified thermistor for outdoor temperature monitoring in a prosthetic system. Initial results show that some of the modified thermistors showed better temperature recording compared to the rest. Finally, such modified thermistors can be a potential alternative for comfortable temperature measurement embedded in the prosthesis system. Such a system can provide valuable insights into temperature distribution and an early warning system for skin problems

### [5] [Multiport Analytical Pixel Electromagnetic Simulator (MAPES) for AI-assisted RFIC and Microwave Circuit Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21274)

Conclusion: MAPES为AI辅助微波电路和RFIC设计提供了一种实用且通用的工具，具有高效性、可扩展性和可靠性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel analytical framework, termed the Multiport Analytical Pixel Electromagnetic Simulator (MAPES). MAPES enables efficient and accurate prediction of the electromagnetic (EM) performance of arbitrary pixel-based microwave (MW) and RFIC structures. Inspired by the Integrated Internal Multiport Method (IMPM), MAPES extends the concept to the pixel presence/absence domain used in AI-assisted EM design. By introducing virtual pixels and diagonal virtual pixels and inserting virtual ports at critical positions, MAPES captures all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal electromagnetic couplings within a single multiport impedance matrix. Only a small set of full-wave simulations (typically about 1% of the datasets required by AI-assisted EM simulators) is needed to construct this matrix. Subsequently, any arbitrary pixel configuration can be evaluated analytically using a closed-form multiport relation without additional full-wave calculations. The proposed approach eliminates data-driven overfitting and ensures accurate results across all design variations. Comprehensive examples for single- and double-layer CMOS processes (180 nm and 65 nm) and PCBs confirm that MAPES achieves high prediction accuracy with 600- 2000x speed improvement compared to CST simulations. Owing to its efficiency, scalability and reliability, MAPES provides a practical and versatile tool for AI-assisted MW circuit and RFIC design across diverse fabrication technologies.

Abstract: Subsurface defects such as delamination, voids, and honeycombing critically affect the durability of concrete bridge decks but are difficult to detect reliably using visual inspection or manual sounding. This paper presents a machine learning based Impact Echo (IE) framework that automates both defect localization and multi-class classification of common concrete defects. Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability. The proposed framework enhances the objectivity, scalability, and repeatability of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE), supporting intelligent, data-driven bridge health monitoring at a network scale.

### [7] [2D Sparse Array Design via Reweighted L1 Second Order Cone Programming for 3D Ultrasound Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21133)
*Xi Zhang,Miguel Bernal,Wei-Ning Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于二阶锥规划和重加权L1技术的稀疏阵列设计方法，设计出252个激活元素的准平坦旁瓣二维稀疏阵列，在256通道限制下实现了-21.26dB的旁瓣水平，在分辨率和对比度之间取得了良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全寻址二维阵列实现三维超声成像需要数千个独立通道，成本高昂。现有随机优化方法设计的稀疏阵列结果不稳定，需要更稳定高效的稀疏阵列设计方法。

Method: 将稀疏阵列合成问题建模为二阶锥规划问题，并实现重加权L1技术来顺序优化SOCP，设计出准平坦旁瓣二维稀疏阵列。

Result: 设计的Q-Flats阵列在Field II仿真中与密集阵列、费马螺旋阵列和50%-Tukey锥化螺旋阵列相比，分辨率比螺旋阵列好约3%，对比度略差于螺旋阵列，但优于锥化螺旋阵列。

Conclusion: 重加权L1 SOCP方法是一种有前景且灵活的方法，能够在分辨率、对比度和激活元素数量之间寻求平衡。

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) fully-addressed arrays can conveniently realize three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging while fully controlled such arrays usually demands thousands of independent channels, which is costly. Sparse array technique using stochastic optimization methods is one of promising techniques to reduce channel counts while due to the stochastic nature of these methods, the optimized results are usually unstable. In this work, we introduce a sparse array design approach that formulates the synthesis problem of sparse arrays as second-order cone programming (SOCP) and a re-weighted L1 technique is implemented to sequentially optimize the SOCP. Based on this method, an on-grid quasi-flatten side-lobe (Q-Flats) 2D sparse array with side-lobe level (SLL) no more than -21.26 dB and 252 activated elements is designed, which aims to achieve as high contrast performance as possible under the limits of resolution and maximum number of independent channels (i.e., 256). The imaging performance of the Q-Flats array was compared with those of a corresponding dense array (Dense), a Fermat spiral array (Spiral) and a spatially 50%-Tukey tapered spiral array (Spiral-Taper) using Field II simulations in a multi-angle steered diverging wave transmission scheme. It was demonstrated that the Dense achieved the best resolution and contrast and the Spiral-Taper the worst. The Q-Flats showed better resolution (about 3%) but slightly worse contrast than the Spiral. All the results indicate the re-weighted L1 SOCP method is a promising and flexible method for seeking trade-offs among resolution, contrast, and number of activated elements.

*Chin-Hung Chen,Ivana Nikoloska,Wim van Houtum,Yan Wu,Alex Alvarado*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于OFDM系统PSK调制的全盲相位感知EM算法，通过利用解码器的外部信息作为模型证据度量来解决EM算法中的局部最大值问题，有效消除信道估计中的相位模糊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统盲EM估计器无法解决信道估计中的未知相位模糊问题，这导致了EM算法的局部最大值问题，限制了其在OFDM系统中的应用效果。

Method: 基于PSK调制的固有对称性生成有限候选模型集，利用解码器选择最可能的候选模型，在EM初始化阶段后仅调用一次算法，后续turbo迭代中复杂度可忽略。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了盲信道估计中的相位模糊问题，显著提高了EM算法的收敛性能，同时保持了较低的额外计算复杂度。

Abstract: This paper presents a fully blind phase-aware expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for OFDM systems with the phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation. This is primarily caused by the unknown phase ambiguity in the channel estimates, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations.

### [9] [Blind Turbo Demodulation for Differentially Encoded OFDM with 2D Trellis Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21345)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全盲的turbo-DE-PSK方案，能够直接从接收信号中联合估计信道相位、信道增益和噪声方差，无需导频信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 利用二维网格分解进行盲相位估计，辅以基于功率的信道增益和噪声方差估计器，实现联合信道参数估计。

Result: 仿真结果显示，盲2D turbo解调器性能接近完美信道知识的接收机，并在实际传输条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的盲turbo-DE-PSK方案能够有效解决DAB类系统中的信道估计挑战，实现接近理想性能的接收效果。

Abstract: Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB)-like systems employ differentially encoded (DE) phase-shift keying (PSK) for transmission. While turbo-DE-PSK receivers offer substantial performance gains through iterative decoding by making the DE-PSK an inner code, they rely on accurate channel estimation without pilots, which is a key challenge in DAB-like scenarios. This paper develops a fully blind turbo-DE-PSK scheme that jointly estimates channel phase, channel gain, and noise variance directly from the received signal. The design leverages a two-dimensional (2D) trellis decomposition for blind phase estimation, complemented by power-based estimators for channel gain and noise variance. We provide a comprehensive system assessment across practical system parameters, including inner code length, phase quantization, and 2D block size. Simulation results show that the blind 2D turbo demodulator approaches the performance of receivers with perfect channel knowledge and remains robust under realistic transmission conditions.

Conclusion: 所提出的分组语义分割多址接入框架通过有效利用用户语义相似性，显著提升了多用户语义通信的性能，为下一代无线网络提供了高效的语义通信解决方案。

Abstract: In this letter, we propose a group-wise semantic splitting multiple access framework for multi-user semantic communication in downlink scenarios. The framework begins by applying a balanced clustering mechanism that groups users based on the similarity of their semantic characteristics, enabling the extraction of group-level common features and user-specific private features. The base station then transmits the common features via multicast and the private features via unicast, effectively leveraging both shared and user-dependent semantic information. To further enhance semantic separability and reconstruction fidelity, we design a composite loss function that integrates a reconstruction loss with a repulsion loss, improving both the accuracy of semantic recovery and the distinctiveness of common embeddings in the latent space. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 3.26% performance improvement over conventional schemes across various channel conditions, validating its robustness and semantic efficiency for next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: This work describes the design and implementation of a low-power wireless communication system for transmitting text using ESP32 modules and the LoRa DXLR01. The proposal arises as a solution to connectivity and energy-efficiency problems commonly found in rural areas and certain urban environments where Wi-Fi or mobile networks are unavailable or operate with limitations. To address this, LoRa technology known for its long-range capability and low power consumption is integrated with an ESP32 responsible for capturing, processing, and sending messages.
  The LoRa DXLR01 module, which operates in the 433 MHz band, is configured with parameters aimed at maximising both transmission range and efficient energy usage. Messages are sent using Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation, improving signal penetration in obstructed areas and reducing the likelihood of errors. On the receiving end, the ESP32 interprets the data and displays it on an LCD screen. Additionally, the received information is sent to the ThingSpeak platform, allowing remote storage and visualisation without relying on conventional network infrastructure.
  Tests conducted in a controlled environment show an average latency of 3.2 seconds for text transmission. It was also verified that the system can be used in applications such as remote monitoring, infrastructure management, and access control.

TL;DR: 本文分析了AFBM波形在MMSE均衡下的SIR性能，发现在滤波时域中出现干扰与正交性近似误差的抵消现象，这解释了滤波时域检测方案相比仿射域等效方案的显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AFBM波形在不同域中的SIR性能差异，特别是探索滤波时域检测方案相比仿射域检测的性能优势及其内在机制。

Method: 在最小均方误差均衡条件下，分别在仿射域和滤波时域分析AFBM波形的信号干扰比，结合离散仿射傅里叶变换和去扩展/映射操作。

Result: 发现滤波时域中出现干扰与正交性近似误差的抵消现象，这种反直觉的抵消在仿射域中不会发生，导致滤波时域检测方案的误码率性能显著优于仿射域等效方案。

Conclusion: 滤波时域检测方案通过干扰与正交性近似误差的抵消机制实现了性能提升，该分析为AFBM波形的优化设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the Affine Filter Bank Modulation (AFBM) waveform is analyzed under minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization in two domains; namely, the affine domain and the filtered time-domain (TD). Due to the incorporation of the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) and despreading/mapping, an interesting and counter-intuitive cancellation of the unwanted combination of the channel induced interference with the orthogonality approximation error is seen in the filtered TD, a process which does not occur in the affine domain. The direct impact on bit error rate (BER) provides a thorough validation of the proposed analysis and explains the substantial gains in performance of the filtered TD detection scheme as opposed to its affine domain equivalent

Conclusion: 该框架为未来B5G/6G和大规模物联网系统中设计能效热噪声通信接收机提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Thermal noise communication (TNC) enables ultra-low-power wireless links for Internet of Things (IoT) devices by modulating the variance of thermal noise, rather than using active carriers. Existing analyses often rely on Gaussian approximations and overlook fading effects, which limits their accuracy. This paper presents an accurate analytical framework for optimal bit detection in TNC systems under Rician fading. Using chi-squared statistics, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood detection threshold and an expression for the bit error probability (BEP) via Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. The proposed model eliminates approximation errors and accurately characterizes performance for finite sample sizes. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the analytical results and demonstrate significant improvements in BEP compared with suboptimal Gaussian-based detection. Furthermore, the influence of key parameters, sample size, resistance ratio, and Rician K-factor, is quantified. The proposed framework provides a solid foundation for designing energy-efficient TNC receivers in future B5G/6G and large-scale IoT systems.

### [14] [Prototype-Guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning for Cross-subject EEG Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20696)
*Dan Li,Hye-Bin Shin,Yeon-Woo Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需历史EEG样本的原型引导无示例持续学习框架，用于跨被试的持续EEG解码任务，有效解决了知识遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于EEG信号在个体间存在显著变异性，在持续EEG解码任务中，随着新被试的引入，先前获得的知识往往会被覆盖。现有方法主要依赖存储历史数据作为重放缓冲区来防止遗忘，但隐私问题或内存限制使得保存这些数据不切实际。

Method: 提出了ProNECL框架，构建类级原型来总结每个被试的判别性表示，并通过跨被试特征对齐和知识蒸馏逐步将新特征空间与全局原型记忆对齐。

Result: 在BCI Competition IV 2a和2b数据集上验证，该框架有效平衡了知识保留和适应性，在跨被试持续EEG解码任务中实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: ProNECL框架能够在无需访问任何历史EEG样本的情况下保留先验知识，为持续EEG解码提供了一种实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to the significant variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals, knowledge acquired from previous subjects is often overwritten as new subjects are introduced in continual EEG decoding task. Current works mainly rely on storing the historical data of seen subjects as a replay buffer to prevent forgetting. However, privacy concerns or memory constraints make keeping such data impractical. Instead, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL)framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing any historical EEG samples. ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject and incrementally aligns new feature spaces with the global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Obtaining safety guarantees for reinforcement learning is a major challenge to achieve applicability for real-world tasks. Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的注意力机制——现代Hopfield注意力(MHA)，通过在现代Hopfield网络和自注意力之间建立更广义的对应关系，解决了深度Transformer中的秩崩溃和token均匀性问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现代Hopfield网络(MHN)在绝热近似下的状态更新规则与Transformer的自注意力层一致，但需要超越这一近似来探索MHN与自注意力之间更深入的关系。

Method: 通过在现代Hopfield网络中引入隐藏状态变量，构建了现代Hopfield注意力(MHA)机制，使注意力分数可以从Transformer的输入层继承到输出层。

Result: 理论和实验证明MHA隐藏状态显著改善了深度Transformer的秩崩溃和token均匀性问题，在Vision Transformer和GPT中无需增加训练参数即可系统性地提高准确率。

Conclusion: Hopfield网络为改进Transformer架构提供了有用的视角，MHA机制展示了Hopfield网络在深度学习中的实用价值。

Abstract: Associative memory models based on Hopfield networks and self-attention based on key-value mechanisms have been popular approaches in the study of memory mechanisms in deep learning. It has been pointed out that the state update rule of the modern Hopfield network (MHN) in the adiabatic approximation is in agreement with the self-attention layer of Transformer. In this paper, we go beyond this approximation and investigate the relationship between MHN and self-attention. Our results show that the correspondence between Hopfield networks and Transformers can be established in a more generalized form by adding a new variable, the hidden state derived from the MHN, to self-attention. This new attention mechanism, modern Hopfield attention (MHA), allows the inheritance of attention scores from the input layer of the Transformer to the output layer, which greatly improves the nature of attention weights. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that MHA hidden states significantly improve serious problem of deep Transformers known as rank collapse and token uniformity. We also confirm that MHA can systematically improve accuracy without adding training parameters to the Vision Transformer or GPT. Our results provide a new case in which Hopfield networks can be a useful perspective for improving the Transformer architecture.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Model pruning is a widely adopted technique to reduce the computational complexity and memory footprint of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, global unstructured pruning often leads to significant degradation in accuracy, typically necessitating fine-tuning on the original training dataset to recover performance. In privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare or finance, access to the original training data is often restricted post-deployment due to regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). This paper proposes a Data-Free Knowledge Distillation framework to bridge the gap between model compression and data privacy. We utilize DeepInversion to synthesize privacy-preserving ``dream'' images from the pre-trained teacher model by inverting Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. These synthetic images serve as a transfer set to distill knowledge from the original teacher to the pruned student network. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 across various architectures (ResNet, MobileNet, VGG) demonstrate that our method significantly recovers accuracy lost during pruning without accessing a single real data point.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for enabling timely intervention and improving outcomes. However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.

Abstract: Inverse problems are fundamental to science and engineering, where the goal is to infer an underlying signal or state from incomplete or noisy measurements. Recent approaches employ diffusion models as powerful implicit priors for such problems, owing to their ability to capture complex data distributions. However, existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems often rely on strong approximations of the posterior distribution, require computationally expensive gradient backpropagation through the score network, or are restricted to linear measurement models.
  In this work, we propose Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS), a general and efficient framework for solving both linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models. RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling. Unlike some of the prior approaches, RePS avoids backpropagation through the score network, substantially reducing computational cost.
  We demonstrate that RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion-based baselines across a range of inverse problems, including both linear and non-linear settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在特定数据子集上存在系统性错误，手动识别这些错误切片需要大量标注工作，需要更高效的方法来发现这些错误模式。

Method: 使用主动学习算法，结合不同的特征表示，通过有限的标注验证来主动发现共享相同错误模式的切片。

Result: 在毒性分类任务中，基于不确定性的主动学习算法效果最好，仅使用2-10%的切片成员信息就能达到竞争性准确率，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 主动切片发现是识别LLMs系统性错误的有效方法，基于不确定性的主动学习算法在多个切片上表现优异，大幅减少了标注需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit systematic errors on specific subsets of data, known as error slices. For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms. On several slices, we find that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms are most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using 2-10% of the available slice membership information, while significantly outperforming baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了两种稳定多轮对话中PPO训练的技术：轮级重要性采样和裁剪偏差校正，解决了令牌级PPO在LLM训练中的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO在训练大型语言模型时经常出现性能不稳定和崩溃的问题，主要源于令牌级重要性采样与多轮环境结构不匹配，以及离策略样本导致的优势估计不准确。

Method: 引入两种互补的稳定技术：轮级重要性采样（与多轮推理的自然结构对齐）和裁剪偏差校正（通过降低不可靠离策略样本的权重来归一化梯度）。提出了三个变体：Turn-PPO、S-PPO和ST-PPO。

Result: 在多轮搜索任务上的实验表明，ST-PPO和S-PPO能有效防止性能崩溃，保持较低的裁剪比率，并获得比标准令牌级PPO更高的任务性能。

Conclusion: 结合轮级重要性采样和裁剪偏差校正为多轮LLM智能体训练提供了一个实用且可扩展的稳定解决方案。

Abstract: PPO has been widely adopted for training large language models (LLMs) at the token level in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces critical challenges in rare long-tail events and complex multi-agent interactions, which are scarce in real-world data yet essential for robust safety validation. This paper presents a high-fidelity scenario generation framework that integrates a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a large language model (LLM). The CVAE encodes historical trajectories and map information from large-scale naturalistic datasets to learn latent traffic structures, enabling the generation of physically consistent base scenarios. Building on this, the LLM acts as an adversarial reasoning engine, parsing unstructured scene descriptions into domain-specific loss functions and dynamically guiding scenario generation across varying risk levels. This knowledge-driven optimization balances realism with controllability, ensuring that generated scenarios remain both plausible and risk-sensitive. Extensive experiments in CARLA and SMARTS demonstrate that our framework substantially increases the coverage of high-risk and long-tail events, improves consistency between simulated and real-world traffic distributions, and exposes autonomous driving systems to interactions that are significantly more challenging than those produced by existing rule- or data-driven methods. These results establish a new pathway for safety validation, enabling principled stress-testing of autonomous systems under rare but consequential events.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态重置是模拟器的基本能力，支持基于样本的规划和模拟器校准。但在复杂模拟器中，当存在潜在变量时，状态重置需要从给定可观测历史的后验分布中采样潜在状态，这是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 将信念状态选择问题简化为一般条件分布选择任务，开发了在仅采样访问下的新算法。提出了两种不同的选择方法：基于潜在状态的选择和基于观测的选择，并分析了它们与下游roll-out方法的交互。

Result: 研究发现两种选择方法在与下游roll-out方法交互时表现出不同的性质：基于观测的选择在最自然的Single-Reset方法下可能失败，但在不太传统的Repeated-Reset方法下具有保证。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了在这个看似简单的问题中存在的丰富算法选择、理论细微差别和开放问题，包括分布偏移和采样策略选择等问题。

Abstract: State resetting is a fundamental but often overlooked capability of simulators. It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.
  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.

In addition, the tutorial highlights open challenges and outlines promising research directions to advance spatio-temporal general intelligence through the development of robust, responsible, and transferable TFMs.

Abstract: We study streaming data with categorical features where the vocabulary of categorical feature values is changing and can even grow unboundedly over time. Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

Conclusion: CHiQPM在可解释性方面取得显著改进，在不牺牲整体准确性的情况下融入可解释性，为人类-AI互补铺平道路。

Abstract: Globally interpretable models are a promising approach for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains. Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.

Conclusion: 提出的Cliff方法成功地将理论原理转化为实践标准，在非线性映射下实现了有效的无监督解缠。

Abstract: Recent theoretical work established the unsupervised identifiability of quantized factors under any diffeomorphism. The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement.

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute "delta" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.

Abstract: We develop a data-driven approach for runtime safety monitoring in flight testing, where pilots perform maneuvers on aircraft with uncertain parameters. Because safety violations can arise unexpectedly as a result of these uncertainties, pilots need clear, preemptive criteria to abort the maneuver in advance of safety violation. To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction. We evaluate our method on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating its ability to reliably identify unsafe scenarios, match theoretical guarantees, and outperform baseline approaches in preemptive classification of risk.

### [31] [Estimating Ising Models in Total Variation Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21008)
*Constantinos Daskalakis,Vardis Kandiros,Rui Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架来分析Ising模型的最大伪似然估计器(MPLE)，针对两类广义Ising模型：具有有界算子范数且满足修正对数Sobolev不等式(MLSI)的模型，以及具有有界无穷范数(有界宽度)的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Ising模型在总变差距离下的统计复杂性已被充分理解，但寻找计算和统计效率高的算法一直具有挑战性。现有研究仅针对特定设置(如树结构、高斯分布交互矩阵等)，缺乏统一的TV距离多项式时间估计框架。

Method: 使用最大伪似然估计器(MPLE)，并采用张量化不等式、测度分解和集中界等多种工具进行统一分析。

Result: 为两类广义Ising模型提供了多项式时间算法和最优或接近最优的样本复杂度保证，统一了多种设置下的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架成功解决了Ising模型在TV距离下的高效估计问题，为两类广义模型提供了多项式时间算法和最优样本复杂度保证。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating Ising models over $n$ variables in Total Variation (TV) distance, given $l$ independent samples from the model. While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings. Our proofs employ a variety of tools from tensorization inequalities to measure decompositions and concentration bounds.

TL;DR: 未经训练的大型神经网络在随机初始化后存在初始猜测偏差，倾向于少数类别，影响早期训练动态。损失函数选择对此阶段有显著影响，特别是Blurry和Piecewise-zero损失函数在面临此偏差时可能无法有效引导训练方向。

Motivation: 研究大型神经网络在随机初始化后存在的初始猜测偏差现象，以及这种偏差如何与不同损失函数相互作用影响早期训练动态。

Method: 分析未经训练的大型神经网络在随机初始化后的预测行为，研究不同损失函数（特别是Blurry和Piecewise-zero损失）在面对初始猜测偏差时的表现。

Result: 发现初始猜测偏差会导致网络偏向少数类别，损失函数选择对早期训练动态有显著影响，某些损失函数在面临此偏差时可能无法有效引导训练。

Conclusion: 损失函数选择对神经网络早期训练阶段有重要影响，需要仔细考虑初始猜测偏差如何与训练方案的各个组件相互作用。

Abstract: Untrained large neural networks, just after random initialization, tend to favour a small subset of classes, assigning high predicted probabilities to these few classes and approximately zero probability to all others. This bias, termed Initial Guessing Bias, affects the early training dynamics, when the model is fitting to the coarse structure of the data. The choice of loss function against which to train the model has a large impact on how these early dynamics play out. Two recent loss functions, Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss, were designed for robustness to label errors but can become unable to steer the direction of training when exposed to this initial bias. Results indicate that the choice of loss function has a dramatic effect on the early phase training of networks, and highlights the need for careful consideration of how Initial Guessing Bias may interact with various components of the training scheme.

Motivation: 传统微调方法（SFT和RLHF）存在安全-能力权衡问题，提升任务性能会降低安全对齐性。RLVR作为有前景的替代方法，其安全性影响尚未被探索。

Method: 通过理论分析推导KL约束优化下的安全漂移上界，并进行大规模实验验证，在五个对抗性安全基准上测试RLVR的效果。

Conclusion: RLVR训练方法能够同时实现安全性和能力提升，为部署具备推理能力的LLMs提供了安全部署的见解。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks typically exhibit a fundamental safety-capability tradeoff, where improving task performance degrades safety alignment even on benign datasets. This degradation persists across standard approaches including supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising alternative that optimizes models on objectively measurable tasks, its safety implications remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of safety properties in RLVR. Theoretically, we derive upper bounds on safety drift under KL-constrained optimization and prove conditions under which safety degradation is eliminated. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments across five adversarial safety benchmarks, demonstrating that RLVR can simultaneously enhance reasoning capabilities while maintaining or improving safety guardrails. Our comprehensive ablation studies examine the effects of optimization algorithms, model scale, and task domains. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption of an inevitable safety capability trade-off, and establish that a specific training methodology can achieve both objectives simultaneously, providing insights for the safe deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统三维磁流体动力学模型计算成本高，限制了边界条件不确定性的快速探索，需要开发高效的替代模型来改进空间天气预报。

Method: 使用球形傅里叶神经算子(SFNO)，通过预测有限径向范围并迭代向外传播解，构建自回归的太阳风径向速度预测模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为高保真太阳风建模建立了新颖的方法论，代码和可视化结果已在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: The solar wind, a continuous outflow of charged particles from the Sun's corona, shapes the heliosphere and impacts space systems near Earth. Accurate prediction of features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is critical for space weather forecasting, but traditional three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties. We introduce the first autoregressive machine learning surrogate for steady-state solar wind radial velocity using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). By predicting a limited radial range and iteratively propagating the solution outward, the model improves accuracy in distant regions compared to a single-step approach. Compared with the numerical HUX surrogate, SFNO demonstrates superior or comparable performance while providing a flexible, trainable, and data-driven alternative, establishing a novel methodology for high-fidelity solar wind modeling.

Motivation: 受超维计算启发，利用高维向量表示实现高效硬件部署和模型鲁棒性，为构建稳健的二进制/量化深度学习模型开辟新方向。

Method: 提出G-Nets家族，将数据作为超立方体中的点进行二进制嵌入，使用汉明距离，每个浮点G-Net都有随机化的二进制嵌入版本（EHD G-Net）。

Result: 二进制模型匹配CNN精度，在CIFAR-10上比先前HDC模型准确率高近30%，实证验证了理论保证的有效性。

Conclusion: G-Nets是神经网络与随机化二进制神经网络之间的理论桥梁，为构建鲁棒的二进制/量化深度学习模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel randomized algorithm for constructing binary neural networks with tunable accuracy. This approach is motivated by hyperdimensional computing (HDC), which is a brain-inspired paradigm that leverages high-dimensional vector representations, offering efficient hardware implementation and robustness to model corruptions. Unlike traditional low-precision methods that use quantization, we consider binary embeddings of data as points in the hypercube equipped with the Hamming distance. We propose a novel family of floating-point neural networks, G-Nets, which are general enough to mimic standard network layers. Each floating-point G-Net has a randomized binary embedding, an embedded hyperdimensional (EHD) G-Net, that retains the accuracy of its floating-point counterparts, with theoretical guarantees, due to the concentration of measure. Empirically, our binary models match convolutional neural network accuracies and outperform prior HDC models by large margins, for example, we achieve almost 30\% higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to prior HDC models. G-Nets are a theoretically justified bridge between neural networks and randomized binary neural networks, opening a new direction for constructing robust binary/quantized deep learning models. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/GNet2025/GNet.

TL;DR: Primal是一个确定性特征映射框架，利用素数平方根的数论独立性构建可调谐的向量表示，提供静态和动态两种算法变体，在低频率下作为等距核映射，在高频率下作为最大熵单向哈希。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 与标准随机投影方法不同，该方法旨在利用Besicovitch性质创建无理频率调制，保证无限非重复相位轨迹，提供数学上严谨的确定性特征映射替代方案。

Method: 提出两种算法变体：StaticPrime（生成接近Welch界准正交性的时间位置编码）和DynamicPrime（通过单一缩放参数σ统一两种数学效用类别的可调谐投影层）。

Result: 经验评估表明，与归一化高斯基线相比，该框架在正交性保持和分布紧致性方面表现更优，计算效率高。

Conclusion: Primal框架为随机矩阵投影提供了一种计算高效、数学严谨的确定性替代方案，在信号重构、压缩感知、超维计算和隐私保护分割学习等应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: We present Primal, a deterministic feature mapping framework that harnesses the number-theoretic independence of prime square roots to construct robust, tunable vector representations. Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter σ. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个插件框架来校正LLM作为评估器时的偏差，并构建置信区间，同时引入自适应算法来优化校准样本分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估器虽然可扩展，但其判断存在噪声，导致准确性估计存在偏差。现有的偏差校正方法通常假设已知模型的精确特异性和敏感性，且在实际中我们只有这些值的估计，如何构建置信区间尚不明确。

Conclusion: 提出的插件框架和自适应算法为LLM作为评估器提供了偏差校正和不确定性量化的实用解决方案，促进了统计上可靠的LLM评估实践。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in lieu of humans. While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation. Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in the accuracy estimate, we introduce an adaptive algorithm that efficiently allocates calibration sample sizes.

TL;DR: 使用自监督学习预训练特征提取器，然后在有噪声标签的数据集上进行标准监督训练，可以在不需要干净标签子集的情况下训练出更抗噪声的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络在有噪声标签的数据上训练会导致过拟合噪声标签，从而泛化能力差、准确率下降。现有方法通常依赖干净数据子集，而本文旨在不依赖干净标签子集的情况下提高模型的噪声鲁棒性。

Method: 采用自监督学习（SimCLR和Barlow Twins）预训练特征提取器，然后在有噪声的数据集上进行标准监督训练。在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上评估合成和真实世界噪声。

Result: 在所有噪声率下，自监督预训练持续提高分类准确率并增强下游标签错误检测能力。随着噪声率增加，性能差距扩大，显示出改进的鲁棒性。在低噪声水平下与ImageNet预训练模型结果相当，在高噪声条件下显著优于它们。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练是一种有效的噪声鲁棒学习方法，无需干净标签子集，在高噪声条件下表现尤其出色。

Abstract: Training deep networks with noisy labels leads to poor generalization and degraded accuracy due to overfitting to label noise. Existing approaches for learning with noisy labels often rely on the availability of a clean subset of data. By pre-training a feature extractor backbone without labels using self-supervised learning (SSL), followed by standard supervised training on the noisy dataset, we can train a more noise robust model without requiring a subset with clean labels. We evaluate the use of SimCLR and Barlow~Twins as SSL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under synthetic and real world noise. Across all noise rates, self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and enhances downstream label-error detection (F1 and Balanced Accuracy). The performance gap widens as the noise rate increases, demonstrating improved robustness. Notably, our approach achieves comparable results to ImageNet pre-trained models at low noise levels, while substantially outperforming them under high noise conditions.

Motivation: 传统基准测试仅通过任务特定分数评估动态图学习器，但很少关注嵌入本身是否能真实反映演化网络的变化。本文旨在解决这一评估缺口。

Method: 定义了表示完整性的概念，设计了三个合成场景（渐进合并、突然移动、周期性重连）来筛选42个候选指标，推荐了一个经过理论和实证验证的指标。

Result: 验证的指标始终将可证明稳定的UASE和IPP模型排名最高，神经方法在特定场景下表现优势，与一步链接预测AUC呈强正相关。

Conclusion: 提出的完整性框架为动态图表示质量提供了任务无关且可解释的评估工具，为模型选择和未来架构设计提供更明确的指导。

Abstract: Real-world systems ranging from airline routes to cryptocurrency transfers are naturally modelled as dynamic graphs whose topology changes over time. Conventional benchmarks judge dynamic-graph learners by a handful of task-specific scores, yet seldom ask whether the embeddings themselves remain a truthful, interpretable reflection of the evolving network. We formalize this requirement as representation integrity and derive a family of indexes that measure how closely embedding changes follow graph changes. Three synthetic scenarios, Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, and Periodic Re-wiring, are used to screen forty-two candidate indexes. Based on which we recommend one index that passes all of our theoretical and empirical tests. In particular, this validated metric consistently ranks the provably stable UASE and IPP models highest. We then use this index to do a comparative study on representation integrity of common dynamic graph learning models. This study exposes the scenario-specific strengths of neural methods, and shows a strong positive rank correlation with one-step link-prediction AUC. The proposed integrity framework, therefore, offers a task-agnostic and interpretable evaluation tool for dynamic-graph representation quality, providing more explicit guidance for model selection and future architecture design.

TL;DR: 比较三种数据重加权方法（遗传算法演化权重、基于数据集特征计算权重、等权重分配）在机器学习模型公平性和预测性能之间的权衡效果。实验表明，演化权重方法能在多数数据集上实现更好的公平性-性能平衡，特别是使用准确率和人口统计均等差异作为优化目标时效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在真实数据上训练时可能产生有偏预测，对边缘化群体造成负面影响。重加权方法通过为训练数据点分配权重来缓解这种偏见。

Method: 比较三种权重生成方法：1）使用遗传算法演化权重，2）仅基于数据集特征计算权重，3）为所有数据点分配相等权重。使用预测指标（准确率、AUC）和公平性指标（人口统计均等差异、子群假阴性公平性）作为评估标准和遗传算法的优化目标。

Result: 在11个公开数据集上的实验表明，演化样本权重产生的模型在公平性和预测性能之间实现了比替代权重方法更好的权衡。但改进程度强烈依赖于优化目标的选择，使用准确率和人口统计均等差异指标优化时，演化权重在最多数据集上显著优于其他策略。

Conclusion: 演化权重方法能够有效平衡模型公平性和预测性能，但优化目标的选择对结果有重要影响。准确率和人口统计均等差异的组合是最有效的优化目标。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data may inadvertently make biased predictions that negatively impact marginalized communities. Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.

Conclusion: 时间步长是医疗保健离线强化学习的核心设计选择，研究结果为超越传统4小时设置提供了证据支持。

Abstract: Existing studies on reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis management have mostly followed an established problem setup, in which patient data are aggregated into 4-hour time steps. Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEC攻击造成巨大经济损失（年损失29亿美元），存在显著的经济不对称性：漏报成本远高于误报成本（比例约1:5480），需要开发有效的检测方案。

Method: 提出两种检测范式：1) 法证心理语言学流：使用CatBoost分析心理语言学特征，具有高可解释性和低延迟；2) 语义流：使用DistilBERT进行深度学习上下文理解，准确性更高但计算成本较大。在对抗性污染数据集(N=7,990)上进行评估。

Result: DistilBERT在Tesla T4 GPU上实现优异检测性能(AUC=1.0000, F1=0.9981)，延迟7.403毫秒；CatBoost实现竞争性检测(AUC=0.9905, F1=0.9486)，延迟降低8.4倍(0.885毫秒)，计算资源消耗可忽略。

Conclusion: 对于有GPU基础设施的组织，DistilBERT提供更优准确性；对于边缘部署或成本敏感环境，CatBoost因可比较的安全性和更低运营成本更合适。两种方法通过成本敏感学习都能实现超过99.96%的投资回报率。

Abstract: Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated social engineering threat that manipulates organizational hierarchies and exploits psychological vulnerabilities, leading to significant financial damage. According to the 2024 FBI Internet Crime Report, BEC accounts for over $2.9 billion in annual adjusted losses, presenting significant economic asymmetry: the cost of a False Negative (fraud loss) exceeds the cost of a False Positive (manual review) by orders of magnitude (approximately 1 to 5,480).
  This paper examines two detection paradigms for BEC: the Forensic Psycholinguistic Stream, which utilizes CatBoost to analyze psycholinguistic cues with high interpretability and low latency, and the Semantic Stream, which employs DistilBERT for deep learning-based contextual language understanding, offering superior accuracy at higher computational cost. We evaluated DistilBERT on an adversarially poisoned dataset (N = 7,990) generated via our Black Hole protocol, benchmarked on Tesla T4 GPU infrastructure, achieving superior detection (AUC = 1.0000, F1 = 0.9981) with acceptable real-time latency (7.403 milliseconds). CatBoost achieves competitive detection (AUC = 0.9905, F1 = 0.9486) at 8.4x lower latency (0.885 milliseconds), consuming negligible computational resources. For organizations with GPU infrastructure, DistilBERT offers superior accuracy. CatBoost is preferable for edge deployments or cost-sensitive environments due to comparable security and lower operational costs. Both approaches demonstrate return on investment exceeding 99.96% when optimized through cost-sensitive learning, by significantly reducing false negatives and associated financial losses.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a popular framework for training sequential decision policies from expert demonstrations via supervised learning. As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

### [44] [Subgoal Graph-Augmented Planning for LLM-Guided Open-World Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20993)
*Shanwei Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SGA-ACR框架，通过集成环境特定的子目标图和结构化实体知识，结合多LLM规划管道，解决LLM在强化学习中规划-执行不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在强化学习中虽然具备强大的高层规划能力，但存在规划-执行不一致的问题，主要源于：1）子目标语义合理但环境不可行；2）单一LLM规划混淆生成与验证，产生过度自信但不可靠的子目标。

Method: SGA-ACR框架包含环境特定子目标图、结构化实体知识和多LLM规划管道（明确分离生成、批判和精炼），以及子目标跟踪器监控执行进度、提供辅助奖励并自适应更新子目标图。

Result: 在开放世界游戏"Crafter"的22个多样化任务上的实验结果表明该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SGA-ACR通过结构化知识表示和多LLM协作规划，显著改善了LLM在强化学习中的规划-执行对齐问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer strong high-level planning capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) by decomposing tasks into subgoals. However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions. Experimental results on 22 diverse tasks in the open-world game "Crafter" demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出FANoise方法，一种特征自适应噪声注入策略，用于改进多模态表示学习中的噪声注入效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多依赖启发式或静态噪声，忽略了训练过程中特征分布的动态特性，需要更智能的噪声注入策略。

Method: 从梯度和特征分布角度系统研究噪声在表示学习中的作用，提出基于对比学习动态特性的特征自适应噪声注入策略FANoise。

Result: 在各种基础VLM模型上的综合实验表明，FANoise在多模态任务上持续提升整体性能。

Conclusion: FANoise通过理论支撑的框架有效减轻噪声的负面影响，同时保留其益处，为表示学习提供了更有效的噪声注入方法。

Abstract: Representation learning is fundamental to modern machine learning, powering applications such as text retrieval and multimodal understanding. However, learning robust and generalizable representations remains challenging. While prior work has demonstrated that active noise injection, a form of data augmentation, can enhance encoding performance, most existing methods rely on heuristic or static noise, overlooking the dynamic nature of feature distributions during training. In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models.

Abstract: The challenge of separating AI-generated text from human-authored content is becoming more urgent as generative AI technologies like ChatGPT become more widely available. In this work, we address this issue by looking at both the detection of content that has been entirely generated by AI and the identification of human text that has been reworded by AI. In our work, a comprehensive methodology to detect AI- generated text using XLM-RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art multilingual transformer model. Our approach includes rigorous preprocessing, and feature extraction involving perplexity, semantic, and readability features. We fine-tuned the XLM-RoBERTa model on a balanced dataset of human and AI-generated texts and evaluated its performance. The model demonstrated high accuracy and robust performance across various text genres. Additionally, we conducted feature analysis to understand the model's decision-making process, revealing that perplexity and attention-based features are critical in differentiating between human and AI-generated texts. Our findings offer a valuable tool for maintaining academic integrity and contribute to the broader field of AI ethics by promoting transparency and accountability in AI systems.

Conclusion: 交错重置是一种简单有效的技术，能显著减少同步重置引起的非平稳性，提升强化学习训练效果

Abstract: Massively parallel GPU simulation environments have accelerated reinforcement learning (RL) research by enabling fast data collection for on-policy RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To maximize throughput, it is common to use short rollouts per policy update, increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ra- tio. However, we find that, in this setting, standard synchronous resets introduce harmful nonstationarity, skewing the learning signal and destabilizing training. We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance. Finally, this technique scales better with more parallel environments compared to naive synchronized rollouts.

### [48] [Gated KalmaNet: A Fading Memory Layer Through Test-Time Ridge Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21016)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gated KalmaNet (GKA) 是一种高效的线性状态空间模型层，通过在线岭回归和卡尔曼滤波的稳定实现，在保持恒定内存和线性计算的同时，解决了传统SSM在召回任务中的性能不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性状态空间模型(SSM)虽然计算高效，但只能维护有损的过去信息摘要，在召回导向任务中表现不佳。需要一种既能完整利用历史信息又能保持SSM效率的方法。

Method: 1. 在测试时解决在线岭回归问题，使用卡尔曼滤波迭代求解

3. 采用切比雪夫迭代替代传统迭代求解器，提高低精度环境下的稳定性

Conclusion: GKA成功弥合了SSM在召回任务中的性能差距，通过数值稳定的在线岭回归实现，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了语言理解能力。

Abstract: As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear state-space models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.

TL;DR: 提出基于自回归条件生成对抗网络的概率性野火蔓延预测模型，相比传统物理模拟器和深度学习模型，在预测精度和边界描绘方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化加剧了野火的频率和严重性，需要快速准确的火灾蔓延预测。物理模拟器计算密集，深度学习模型预测过于平滑，无法捕捉火灾传播的复杂非线性动态。

Conclusion: 提出的自回归CGAN框架提高了野火蔓延预测的准确性和物理可解释性，为时间敏感的响应和疏散规划提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of wildfires, making rapid and accurate prediction of fire spread essential for effective mitigation and response. Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution. The proposed CGAN-based autoregressive framework enhances both the accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, offering a promising foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.

Conclusion: ELBO$_{TDS}$框架有效解决了推荐系统中的时间分布偏移问题，通过数据增强和因果建模实现了更好的时间泛化能力，具有实际工业应用价值。

Abstract: Temporal distribution shift (TDS) erodes the long-term accuracy of recommender systems, yet industrial practice still relies on periodic incremental training, which struggles to capture both stable and transient patterns. Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure. Extensive experiments supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate that our method achieves superior temporal generalization, yielding a 2.33\% uplift in GMV per user and has been successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search.

Abstract: Dairy farmers should decide to keep or cull a cow based on an objective assessment of her likely performance in the herd. For this purpose, farmers need to identify more resilient cows, which can cope better with farm conditions and complete more lactations. This decision-making process is inherently complex, with significant environmental and economic implications. In this study, we develop an AI-driven model to predict cow longevity using historical multivariate time-series data recorded from birth. Leveraging advanced AI techniques, specifically Multi-Head Attention Transformers, we analysed approximately 780,000 records from 19,000 unique cows across 7 farms in Australia. The results demonstrate that our model achieves an overall determination coefficient of 83% in predicting herd life across the studied farms, highlighting its potential for practical application in dairy herd management.

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a core technology for future wireless communication systems, enabling the identification of modulation schemes without prior knowledge. This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions. This paper's experimental results validate the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for AMC, suggesting its potential application in adaptive spectrum management and advanced cognitive radio systems.

Abstract: Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI)-based sensing provides a non-invasive, device-free approach for tasks such as human activity recognition and crowd counting, but large-scale deployment is hindered by the need for extensive site-specific training data. Federated learning (FL) offers a way to avoid raw data sharing but is challenged by heterogeneous sensing data and device resources. This paper proposes FedAPA, a collaborative Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing algorithm that uses adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy to assign similarity-based weights to peer prototypes, enabling adaptive client contributions and yielding a personalized global prototype for each client instead of a fixed-weight aggregation. During local training, we adopt a hybrid objective that combines classification learning with representation contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge. We provide a convergence analysis of FedAPA and evaluate it in a real-world distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting scenario with six environments and up to 20 people. The results show that our method outperform multiple baselines in terms of accuracy, F1 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and communication overhead, with FedAPA achieving at least a 9.65% increase in accuracy, a 9% gain in F1 score, a 0.29 reduction in MAE, and a 95.94% reduction in communication overhead.

Method: 提出时间扩散规划器(TDP)：1)生成随时间逐渐模糊的初始计划；2)后续时间步用少量去噪步骤更新而非重新生成计划；3)引入自动重规划机制防止偏差。

Result: 在D4RL数据集上，相比每时间步生成新计划的方法，TDP将决策频率提高11-24.8倍，同时达到更高或相当的性能。

Conclusion: TDP通过时间维度的去噪分布和自动重规划，在保持性能的同时显著提高了扩散规划的决策效率。

Abstract: Diffusion planning is a promising method for learning high-performance policies from offline data. To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance.

Abstract: Offline data selection and online self-refining generation, which enhance the data quality, are crucial steps in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. We tackle offline data selection and online self-refining generations through an optimization perspective. Specifically, bilevel data selection is used for offline data selection with respect to the validation dataset, and we treat online self-refining generation as a model adaptation step of selecting the model trained on current responses that best fits the validation data. Our framework offers a unified understanding of offline data selection and self-refining generation by assigning a learned data weight to each question and response, either explicitly or implicitly. For the first time, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel data selection framework and demonstrate its performance gains over unfiltered direct mixing baselines. By combining offline data with validation-weighted online generations, our method enhances fine-tuning performance. Experiments on quality enhancement and safety-aware LLM fine-tuning validate its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了平衡微调（BFT）方法，通过两层加权机制解决生物医学领域LLM后训练中的过拟合和奖励信号缺失问题，显著优于标准监督微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在将LLM与生物医学知识对齐时面临两个主要限制：1）标准监督微调容易过拟合到表面指令模式而无法内化碎片化科学知识；2）强化学习因需要实验验证奖励信号而不实用。

Method: BFT采用两层加权机制：1）在token级别通过预测概率缩放损失来稳定梯度防止过拟合；2）在样本级别使用"最小组置信度"自适应增强困难样本的学习。

Result: 在医学任务中，BFT使LLM获得了SFT遗漏的知识；在生物学任务中，BFT-based LLM在生物过程推理上超越了GeneAgent；BFT生成的文本嵌入可直接用于下游任务如基因相互作用和单细胞扰动响应预测。

Conclusion: BFT促进了LLM在生物医学研究中的广泛应用，能够从稀疏数据中学习复杂推理而无需外部奖励信号。

Abstract: Effective post-training is essential to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized biomedical knowledge to accelerate life science research. However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses "minimum group confidence" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research.

TL;DR: 提出Deceptron双向模块，通过输出空间梯度下降和局部逆映射，显著加速逆问题求解，在热传导和阻尼振荡器问题上分别减少约20倍和2-3倍迭代次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理科学中的逆问题通常在输入空间是病态的，导致步长敏感。需要一种轻量级方法来学习局部逆映射以改善收敛性。

Method: Deceptron学习可微前向代理的局部逆，结合监督拟合、前向-反向一致性、轻量谱惩罚、软偏置约束和雅可比组合惩罚(JCP)。D-IPG在输出空间进行下降步，通过g拉回并在相同回溯和停止规则下投影。

Result: 在Heat-1D初始条件恢复和阻尼振荡器逆问题上，D-IPG达到固定归一化容差所需的迭代次数比投影梯度少约20倍(Heat)和2-3倍(Oscillator)，与Gauss-Newton方法在迭代次数和成本上竞争。

Conclusion: Deceptron和D-IPG方法能有效加速逆问题求解，JCP减少组合误差并跟踪迭代收益。DeceptronNet(v0)在严格公平协议下学习少步校正，表现出快速收敛特性。

Abstract: Inverse problems in the physical sciences are often ill-conditioned in input space, making progress step-size sensitive. We propose the Deceptron, a lightweight bidirectional module that learns a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate. Training combines a supervised fit, forward-reverse consistency, a lightweight spectral penalty, a soft bias tie, and a Jacobian Composition Penalty (JCP) that encourages $J_g(f(x))\,J_f(x)\!\approx\!I$ via JVP/VJP probes. At solve time, D-IPG (Deceptron Inverse-Preconditioned Gradient) takes a descent step in output space, pulls it back through $g$, and projects under the same backtracking and stopping rules as baselines. On Heat-1D initial-condition recovery and a Damped Oscillator inverse problem, D-IPG reaches a fixed normalized tolerance with $\sim$20$\times$ fewer iterations on Heat and $\sim$2-3$\times$ fewer on Oscillator than projected gradient, competitive in iterations and cost with Gauss-Newton. Diagnostics show JCP reduces a measured composition error and tracks iteration gains. We also preview a single-scale 2D instantiation, DeceptronNet (v0), that learns few-step corrections under a strict fairness protocol and exhibits notably fast convergence.

*Ivan Novikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLPMoE是一种无需训练、确定性的转换方法，将Transformer块中的稠密MLP重构为静态高基数专家混合结构，通过张量切片和求和实现，无需梯度、校准数据或路由器训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型作为稠密Transformer部署，每个前馈块的所有参数都对每个token激活，计算效率低下。现有方法依赖聚类、激活分析等复杂技术，需要校准数据。

Method: 使用张量切片和求和将稠密MLP转换为静态专家混合结构，引入Fractal Fade（差分分支稀疏）和Compensated Pruning（方差保持分支缩减）实现结构化稀疏。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-0.5B和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B上，零样本转换使困惑度变化小于0.05%，参数数量基本不变。在8B模型上，差分稀疏移除约20%MLP参数，困惑度保持在稠密基线2%以内。

Conclusion: 该方法完全基于现有检查点后处理，无需梯度、校准集或路由器训练，提供了一种高效的计算优化方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly deployed as dense transformers, where every parameter in every feed-forward block is activated for every token. While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

Result: 实验结果表明该模型优于基线方法，提供了一个鲁棒且可解释的多级神经影像元分析范式。

Conclusion: 通过双曲脑-文本表示，该框架能够有效捕捉神经影像数据的语义和层次特征，为神经影像元分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Various neuroimaging studies suffer from small sample size problem which often limit their reliability. Meta-analysis addresses this challenge by aggregating findings from different studies to identify consistent patterns of brain activity. However, traditional approaches based on keyword retrieval or linear mappings often overlook the rich hierarchical structure in the brain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to bridge the gap between neuroscience literature and brain activation maps. By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines, offering a robust and interpretable paradigm of multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis via hyperbolic brain-text representation.

Conclusion: GESR范式通过引入目标感知的注意力机制，在保持早期排序系统效率的同时，有效提升了推荐效果，实现了效率与效果的更好平衡。

Abstract: Large-scale recommendations commonly adopt a multi-stage cascading ranking system paradigm to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the "user-item decoupling" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling within an ESR stage at such a scale.

TL;DR: 本文分析了扩散语言模型解码策略的瓶颈，提出高置信度token优先策略存在信息效率问题，并提出了探索-利用策略ETE来提升解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DLM解码策略依赖高置信度token，但这种方法存在信息理论瓶颈，限制了解码进度并减缓生成速度。高概率token携带信息量少，严格依赖它们会限制每轮解码的有效进展。

Method: 提出了探索-利用策略ETE，结合跨块解码和针对高不确定性token的探索，重塑条件分布并触发置信预测的级联效应。

Result: 实验验证了理论界限，表明ETE相比仅依赖置信度的基线方法，在不影响生成质量的情况下持续减少所需解码轮数。

Conclusion: 证明了高置信度token优先策略本质上效率低下，建立了比特-轮数原则，并提出了有效的ETE解码策略来最大化信息吞吐量和解码效率。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive language models (LMs). DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRIDGE提出了一种结构化提示方法，用于可扩展的验证程序生成，通过将验证分解为代码、规范和证明三个相互关联的领域，显著提高了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在代码生成方面表现出色，但在程序验证方面存在困难，特别是在交互式证明框架如Lean4中。主要挑战是可扩展性：验证合成不仅需要代码，还需要精确的规范和正确性证明，而现有方法很少能同时涵盖这三个领域。

Method: BRIDGE将验证分解为三个相互关联的领域：代码（可执行实现）、规范（形式化意图声明）和证明（构造性正确性论证）。通过引出不同的推理行为（功能性、规范驱动和证明导向）作为中间表示，保留语义结构并连接这些领域。

Result: 功能性推理将形式语言（Lean4）中代码的正确性提高了近1.5倍（pass@5），推理时间计算效率提高了2倍。规范驱动提示将Python编码通过率提高了高达17.5%。

Conclusion: 结构化领域对齐是推进验证合成的有前景方向。BRIDGE为通过专家迭代或RLVR进行训练奠定了基础，使模型能够在代码、规范和证明之间内化这些推理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs.

Motivation: 现有的基于神经网络的MILP分支方法在处理树深度变化时的语义差异、上游节点数据稀缺以及强分支样本收集成本高等方面存在困难。

Method: 通过基于特征分布对分支定界节点进行分组，训练GCNN判别模型逐步分离不同组别的节点，学习更细粒度的节点表示。引入上游增强的MILP推导过程，生成理论等价和扰动实例来解决数据稀缺和不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 所提出的动态分层对比训练框架能够有效建模节点间的细微语义差异，显著提升分支准确性和求解效率，特别对于上游节点效果更为明显。

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental class of NP-hard problems that has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. The Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) method is the dominant approach for solving MILPs and the branching plays an important role in B\&B methods. Neural-based learning frameworks have recently been developed to enhance branching policies and the efficiency of solving MILPs. However, these methods still struggle with semantic variation across depths, the scarcity of upstream nodes, and the costly collection of strong branching samples. To address these issues, we propose \ours, a Dynamic \underline{\textbf{S}}tratified \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Training Framework for \underline{\textbf{MILP}} Branching. It groups branch-and-bound nodes based on their feature distributions and trains a GCNN-based discriminative model to progressively separate nodes across groups, learning finer-grained node representations throughout the tree. To address data scarcity and imbalance at upstream nodes, we introduce an upstream-augmented MILP derivation procedure that generates both theoretically equivalent and perturbed instances. \ours~effectively models subtle semantic differences between nodes, significantly enhancing branching accuracy and solving efficiency, particularly for upstream nodes. Extensive experiments on standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that our method enhances branching accuracy, reduces solving time, and generalizes effectively to unseen instances.

Abstract: Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is retracing the Internet's path from centralized provision to distributed creation. Initially, resource-intensive computation concentrates within institutions capable of training and serving large models.Eventually, as federated learning matures, billions of edge devices holding sensitive data will be able to collectively improve models without surrendering raw information, enabling both contribution and consumption at scale. This democratic vision remains unrealized due to certain compositional gaps; aggregators handle updates without accountability, economic mechanisms are lacking and even when present remain vulnerable to gaming, coordination serializes state modifications limiting scalability, and governance permits retroactive manipulation. This work addresses these gaps by leveraging cryptographic receipts to prove aggregation correctness, geometric novelty measurement to prevent incentive gaming, parallel object ownership to achieve linear scalability, and time-locked policies to check retroactive manipulation.

Abstract: Understanding how chemical perturbations propagate through biological systems is essential for robust molecular property prediction. While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks. These results demonstrate the advantage of hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning for reliable and biologically grounded molecular representations, offering a generalizable framework for integrative biomedical modeling.

Motivation: 联邦学习(FL)中的梯度反转攻击是严重的隐私威胁，但这一漏洞在SNN中的影响尚未被充分探索。SNN的非可微性和替代梯度训练可能使其梯度与原始输入相关性较低，从而提供更好的隐私保护。

Conclusion: 事件驱动动力学和替代梯度训练的结合显著降低了梯度的信息含量，表明神经形态计算具有固有的隐私保护潜力。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.

Abstract: Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction hinges on the quality of health indicators (HIs), yet existing methods often fail to disentangle complex degradation mechanisms in multi-sensor systems or quantify uncertainty in HI reliability. This paper introduces a novel framework for HI construction, advancing three key contributions. First, we adapt Reconstruction along Projected Pathways (RaPP) as a health indicator (HI) for RUL prediction for the first time, showing that it outperforms traditional reconstruction error metrics. Second, we show that augmenting RaPP-derived HIs with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) via Monte Carlo dropout and probabilistic latent spaces- significantly improves RUL-prediction robustness. Third, and most critically, we propose indicator groups, a paradigm that isolates sensor subsets to model system-specific degradations, giving rise to our novel method, I-GLIDE which enables interpretable, mechanism-specific diagnostics. Evaluated on data sourced from aerospace and manufacturing systems, our approach achieves marked improvements in accuracy and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art HI methods while providing actionable insights into system failure pathways. This work bridges the gap between anomaly detection and prognostics, offering a principled framework for uncertainty-aware degradation modeling in complex systems.

This work proposes a more robust and efficient pipeline that leverages Fast-mRMR feature selection to retain only relevant, non-redundant features for classifiers. This enables us to build simpler and more effective models, as well as to combine different biological feature sets. Experiments on Dietary Restriction datasets show significant improvements over existing methods, proving that feature selection can be critical for reliable gene prioritization.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient seismic response prediction is essential for the design of resilient structures. While the Finite Element Method (FEM) remains the standard for nonlinear seismic analysis, its high computational demands limit its scalability and real time applicability. Recent developments in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, have shown promise in reducing the computational cost of nonlinear seismic analysis of structures. However, these data driven models often struggle to generalize and capture the underlying physics, leading to reduced reliability. We propose a novel Physics Informed U Net LSTM framework that integrates physical laws with deep learning to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. By embedding domain specific constraints into the learning process, the proposed model achieves improved predictive performance over conventional Machine Learning architectures. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between purely data driven methods and physics based modeling, offering a robust and computationally efficient alternative for seismic response prediction of structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDPM能够生成合成时间序列数据来提升分类器性能，但其采样过程计算成本高昂，需要加速方法。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can generate synthetic timeseries data to help improve the performance of a classifier, but their sampling process is computationally expensive. We address this by combining implicit diffusion models with a novel Sawtooth Sampler that accelerates the reverse process and can be applied to any pretrained diffusion model. Our approach achieves a 30 times speed-up over the standard baseline while also enhancing the quality of the generated sequences for classification tasks.

Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated unparalleled sampling quality and diversity in numerous fields, such as image generation, voice synthesis, and tabular data synthesis, etc. Inspired by those outstanding results, we apply SGMs to synthesize time-series by learning its conditional score function. To this end, we present a conditional score network for time-series synthesis, deriving a denoising score matching loss tailored for our purposes. In particular, our presented denoising score matching loss is the conditional denoising score matching loss for time-series synthesis. In addition, our framework is such flexible that both regular and irregular time-series can be synthesized with minimal changes to our model design. Finally, we obtain exceptional synthesis performance on various time-series datasets, achieving state-of-the-art sampling diversity and quality.

TL;DR: 研究发现掩码扩散语言模型存在两个关键限制：强烈的局部性偏见和对附加掩码标记的敏感性，并提出了一种掩码无关损失函数来改善这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MDLMs理论上应该能够更均匀地利用上下文，但需要验证其实际上下文理解能力，并识别现有训练范式的局限性。

Method: 通过系统消融实验分析MDLMs的上下文理解能力，并引入掩码无关损失函数来减少掩码标记的干扰效应。

Result: 发现MDLMs存在强烈的局部性偏见，性能对相关信息位置敏感；附加掩码标记会显著降低上下文理解能力；使用掩码无关损失函数微调可大幅改善模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 当前MDLM训练范式存在关键限制，提出的掩码无关损失函数为构建具有更强上下文理解能力的基于扩散的语言模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs), leveraging a denoising objective that, in principle, should enable more uniform context utilisation. In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly adopted in scientific research, yet the quality and reliability of results often depend on how experiments are designed and documented. Poor baselines, inconsistent preprocessing, or insufficient validation can lead to misleading conclusions about model performance. This paper presents a practical and structured guide for conducting ML experiments in scientific applications, focussing on reproducibility, fair comparison, and transparent reporting. We outline a step-by-step workflow, from dataset preparation to model selection and evaluation, and propose metrics that account for overfitting and instability across validation folds, including the Logarithmic Overfitting Ratio (LOR) and the Composite Overfitting Score (COS).

TL;DR: 提出Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL)方法，通过结合监督损失和随机正则化机制来增强对抗性逆强化学习在复杂不完美信息环境中的表现，特别是在HULHE扑克游戏中取得了更好的样本效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性逆强化学习(AIRL)在处理稀疏奖励问题方面有潜力，但在高度复杂的不完美信息环境中的表现尚未充分探索。本文旨在解决AIRL在HULHE扑克等复杂环境中推断奖励函数能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出H-AIRL方法，在AIRL基础上结合专家数据的监督损失和随机正则化机制，增强奖励推断和策略学习能力。在Gymnasium基准和HULHE扑克环境中进行实验评估。

Result: 实验结果显示H-AIRL相比AIRL具有更高的样本效率和更稳定的学习过程，在复杂不完美信息环境中表现更好。

Conclusion: 将监督信号融入逆强化学习具有显著优势，H-AIRL为处理具有挑战性的现实世界问题提供了一个有前景的框架。

Abstract: Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) has shown promise in addressing the sparse reward problem in reinforcement learning (RL) by inferring dense reward functions from expert demonstrations. However, its performance in highly complex, imperfect-information settings remains largely unexplored. To explore this gap, we evaluate AIRL in the context of Heads-Up Limit Hold'em (HULHE) poker, a domain characterized by sparse, delayed rewards and significant uncertainty. In this setting, we find that AIRL struggles to infer a sufficiently informative reward function. To overcome this limitation, we contribute Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL), an extension that enhances reward inference and policy learning by incorporating a supervised loss derived from expert data and a stochastic regularization mechanism. We evaluate H-AIRL on a carefully selected set of Gymnasium benchmarks and the HULHE poker setting. Additionally, we analyze the learned reward function through visualization to gain deeper insights into the learning process. Our experimental results show that H-AIRL achieves higher sample efficiency and more stable learning compared to AIRL. This highlights the benefits of incorporating supervised signals into inverse RL and establishes H-AIRL as a promising framework for tackling challenging, real-world settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的局部特征归因方法保真度评估指标DPC，通过结合扰动和归因方向，实现10倍加速并消除随机性，提供确定性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等高风险场景中，需要忠实反映模型决策过程的解释方法。现有保真度指标如Infidelity依赖蒙特卡洛近似，需要大量模型评估且引入随机性不确定性。

Method: 在引导扰动实验中修改现有的预测变化(PC)指标，结合扰动和归因方向，提出定向预测变化(DPC)指标。

Result: 在皮肤病变图像和金融表格数据两个数据集、两个黑盒模型、七种解释算法和广泛超参数范围内，评估了4744个不同解释，DPC与PC一起实现了对基线导向和局部特征归因方法的全面高效评估。

Conclusion: DPC指标提供了确定性、可重复的评估结果，与局部Infidelity测量相同属性，但计算效率更高且无随机性。

Abstract: The utility of an explanation method critically depends on its fidelity to the underlying machine learning model. Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.

Abstract: Natural disasters remain a major challenge for Bangladesh, so real-time monitoring and quick response systems are essential. In this study, we present BanglaMM-Disaster, an end-to-end deep learning-based multimodal framework for disaster classification in Bangla, using both textual and visual data from social media. We constructed a new dataset of 5,037 Bangla social media posts, each consisting of a caption and a corresponding image, annotated into one of nine disaster-related categories. The proposed model integrates transformer-based text encoders, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa, with CNN backbones such as ResNet50, DenseNet169, and MobileNetV2, to process the two modalities. Using early fusion, the best model achieves 83.76% accuracy. This surpasses the best text-only baseline by 3.84% and the image-only baseline by 16.91%. Our analysis also shows reduced misclassification across all classes, with noticeable improvements for ambiguous examples. This work fills a key gap in Bangla multimodal disaster analysis and demonstrates the benefits of combining multiple data types for real-time disaster response in low-resource settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过为查询和键权重分配参数相关的学习率来控制logits变化，解决transformer训练中的稳定性问题，在MLA设置中优于其他方法，性能与QK归一化相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决transformer模型中查询和键权重稳定性问题，特别是当QK归一化不适用时（如MLA场景），需要找到替代方案来稳定训练过程。

Method: 为查询和键权重分配参数相关的学习率来控制logits变化，这是一种廉价干预方法，允许提高网络的基础学习率。

Result: 该方法在MLA设置中优于其他方法，在使用多头注意力时性能与QK归一化相当，同时提高了基础学习率。

Conclusion: 通过控制logits变化的学习率调整方法能够有效解决transformer权重稳定性问题，特别是在QK归一化不适用的场景下。

Abstract: Stability of neural network weights is critical when training transformer models. The query and key weights are particularly problematic, as they tend to grow large without any intervention. Applying normalization to queries and keys, known as `QK norm', fixes stability issues in practice, but is not always applicable. For example, QK norm is not compatible with Multi Latent Attention (MLA) because QK norm requires full materialization of queries and keys during inference, which is not done in MLA. In this paper we suggest that controlling the changes to logits is important for stability. We show that these changes are controllable by assigning parameter-dependent learning rates to the query and key weights. We find that our cheap intervention allows us to increase the base learning rate of the network, outperform other methods in the MLA setting, and achieve performance competitive with QK norm when using Multi-head Attention.

Motivation: 传统异常检测方法假设训练数据是纯净的，但实际数据往往包含污染。现有方法依赖固定的污染比例假设，当假设与实际不符时性能严重下降，特别是在正常与异常数据分布重叠的噪声环境中

Method: AAR方法使用改进的z-score和高斯混合模型阈值动态排除异常，结合硬拒绝和软拒绝策略来平衡保留正常数据和排除异常数据

Conclusion: AAR提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，增强了对抗污染数据集的鲁棒性，为安全、医疗等领域的实际应用铺平了道路

Abstract: Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has emerged as a critical tool for extracting fine-grained sentiment insights from user-generated content, particularly in e-commerce and social media domains. However, research on Bangla ABSA remains significantly underexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and specialized frameworks for triplet extraction in this language. This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity. This research advances the state-of-the-art in low-resource language sentiment analysis and provides a scalable solution for Bangla e-commerce analytics applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于贝叶斯惊喜的动态计算路由Transformer架构：SDT通过决策层和动态层交替实现空间计算路由，STT在时间维度上动态执行或绕过Transformer块，显著减少计算和KV缓存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer架构的刚性、均匀计算分配限制了效率和可扩展性，特别是在大规模模型和长序列场景下。需要动态路由计算来学习在何处和何时进行计算。

Method: SDT：在解码器堆栈中交替使用决策层和动态层，决策层计算完整后验和轻量先验，动态层基于贝叶斯惊喜进行Top-K路由。STT：在时间维度上使用转移网络预测残差更新，形成时间变化假设，指导路由器动态执行或绕过Transformer块。

Conclusion: 提出的架构为效率建立了灵活框架，为更高效模型设定了路径，展示了条件计算在计算精度权衡方面的初步见解。

Abstract: The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.

TL;DR: 提出浅层通用多项式网络(SUPNs)，用单层可学习系数的多项式替代除最后一层外的所有隐藏层，以更少的参数实现足够的表达能力，在近似误差和变异性上优于DNNs和KANs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络和KANs通常需要大量可训练参数，导致网络不透明、优化空间大，容易产生泛化误差差异大的局部极小值，网络初始化对模型精度影响过大。

Method: 提出SUPNs，将除最后一层外的所有隐藏层替换为单层可学习系数的多项式，结合DNNs和多项式的优势，用更少参数实现足够表达能力。

Result: 在13,000多个训练模型的大规模数值实验中，对于给定参数数量，SUPNs的近似误差和变异性通常比DNNs和KANs低一个数量级，甚至在非光滑函数上优于多项式投影。

Conclusion: SUPNs收敛速度与同阶最佳多项式逼近相同，推导了准最优参数公式，在保持表达能力的同时显著减少参数数量，提高训练稳定性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are popular methods for function approximation due to their flexibility and expressivity. However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions.

Abstract: Ensemble learning improves classification performance by combining multiple base classifiers. While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns. This paper investigates the relationship between ensemble size and performance through the lens of linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and future research.

Conclusion: CBO方法为神经网络训练提供了有前景的替代方案，特别是在多任务学习场景下，其均值场理论框架为理解优化过程提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study two-layer neural networks and train these with a particle-based method called consensus-based optimization (CBO). We compare the performance of CBO against Adam on two test cases and demonstrate how a hybrid approach, combining CBO with Adam, provides faster convergence than CBO. In the context of multi-task learning, we recast CBO into a formulation that offers less memory overhead. The CBO method allows for a mean-field limit formulation, which we couple with the mean-field limit of the neural network. To this end, we first reformulate CBO within the optimal transport framework. Finally, in the limit of infinitely many particles, we define the corresponding dynamics on the Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein space and show that the variance decreases monotonically.

Abstract: Translating non-invasive signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and ballistocardiography (BCG) into clinically meaningful signals like arterial blood pressure (ABP) is vital for continuous, low-cost healthcare monitoring. However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.

### [87] [IntAttention: A Fully Integer Attention Pipeline for Efficient Edge Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21513)
*Wanli Zhong,Haibo Feng,Zirui Zhou,Hanyang Peng,Shiqi Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IntAttention是一种完全整数的注意力机制，通过IndexSoftmax算子消除softmax中的浮点运算，在边缘设备上实现3.7倍加速和61%能耗降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上Transformer模型的部署受限于延迟和能耗预算。虽然INT8量化加速了主要矩阵乘法，但softmax成为主要瓶颈，其反量化-softmax-再量化过程占注意力总延迟的65%，破坏了端到端整数数据流。

Method: 提出IntAttention，核心是IndexSoftmax算子，在整数域完全替代浮点指数运算。集成稀疏感知裁剪、32项查找表近似和直接整数归一化，消除所有数据类型转换开销。

Result: 在Armv8 CPU上实现3.7倍加速和61%能耗降低，比传统INT8注意力管道快2.0倍，同时在多种语言和视觉模型中保持与基线相当的高精度。

Conclusion: IntAttention为商品化边缘设备提供了实用高效的Transformer推理解决方案，无需重新训练即可部署。

Abstract: Deploying Transformer models on edge devices is limited by latency and energy budgets. While INT8 quantization effectively accelerates the primary matrix multiplications, it exposes the softmax as the dominant bottleneck. This stage incurs a costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour, which can account for up to 65% of total attention latency and disrupts the end-to-end integer dataflow critical for edge hardware efficiency. To address this limitation, we present IntAttention, the first fully integer, plug-and-play attention pipeline without retraining. At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs. These gains are achieved with high-fidelity accuracy comparable to baselines across diverse language and vision models, enabling practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices. Code will be released in later version of this work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在时间序列分类中表现出色，但其内部决策机制难以理解。现有可解释性方法主要关注输入输出归因，对内部机制揭示不足。

Method: 采用机制可解释性技术：激活修补、注意力显著性分析和稀疏自编码器，系统探测注意力头和时间步的内部因果作用。

Result: 在基准时间序列数据集上构建了因果图，揭示了驱动正确分类的关键注意力头和时间位置，并展示了稀疏自编码器在发现可解释潜在特征方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 研究为Transformer可解释性提供了方法论贡献，并揭示了Transformer在时间序列分类任务中功能机制的新见解。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have become state-of-the-art tools in various machine learning tasks, including time series classification, yet their complexity makes understanding their internal decision-making challenging. Existing explainability methods often focus on input-output attributions, leaving the internal mechanisms largely opaque. This paper addresses this gap by adapting various Mechanistic Interpretability techniques; activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders, from NLP to transformer architectures designed explicitly for time series classification. We systematically probe the internal causal roles of individual attention heads and timesteps, revealing causal structures within these models. Through experimentation on a benchmark time series dataset, we construct causal graphs illustrating how information propagates internally, highlighting key attention heads and temporal positions driving correct classifications. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of sparse autoencoders for uncovering interpretable latent features. Our findings provide both methodological contributions to transformer interpretability and novel insights into the functional mechanics underlying transformer performance in time series classification tasks.

Motivation: 现实世界数据（如气候应用）通常包含空间网格时间序列数据，系统在不同时空点的行为相似但存在变化，这些变化既包含重要信息，又可能影响假设平稳性或空间平移不变性的算法的稳定性和有效性。

Method: 修改基于约束的因果发现方法中的独立性测试，构建模块化框架，可轻松扩展并利用现有因果发现方法（如PC、FCI、PCMCI等），结合变化点检测、聚类等相关技术。

Result: 开发了一个极其模块化、易于扩展且广泛适用的框架，能够利用现有因果发现方法而几乎无需修改，并通过分解为更易处理的子问题来简化理解基本限制和权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模块化设计实现了对因果图变化信息的系统分析，便于理解基本限制、超参数权衡和结果的统计解释，开源实现即将发布。

Abstract: Real-world data, for example in climate applications, often consists of spatially gridded time series data or data with comparable structure. While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems. The division into more accessible sub-problems also simplifies the understanding of fundamental limitations, hyperparameters controlling trade-offs and the statistical interpretation of results. An open-source implementation will be available soon.

Motivation: 战略分类中部署分类器会引发战略行为导致分布偏移，现有方法主要关注线性设置，但许多情况下非线性分类器更合适，而计算非线性设置中的最佳响应是主要限制。

Method: 通过优化智能体目标的拉格朗日对偶来计算最佳响应，该方法在非线性分类器设置中可直接应用。

Conclusion: 提出的方法解决了战略分类中非线性分类器设置的关键限制，为评估和训练提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We consider the problem of strategic classification, where the act of deploying a classifier leads to strategic behaviour that induces a distribution shift on subsequent observations. Current approaches to learning classifiers in strategic settings are focused primarily on the linear setting, but in many cases non-linear classifiers are more suitable. A central limitation to progress for non-linear classifiers arises from the inability to compute best responses in these settings. We present a novel method for computing the best response by optimising the Lagrangian dual of the Agents' objective. We demonstrate that our method reproduces best responses in linear settings, identifying key weaknesses in existing approaches. We present further results demonstrating our method can be straight-forwardly applied to non-linear classifier settings, where it is useful for both evaluation and training.

TL;DR: 提出基于多尺度时间对齐网络(MSTAN)的电子健康记录风险预测方法，通过可学习的时间对齐机制和多尺度卷积特征提取，解决EHR中的时间不规则性、采样间隔差异和多尺度动态依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子健康记录(EHR)中存在的三个关键挑战：时间不规则性、采样间隔差异以及多尺度动态依赖关系，这些因素限制了传统方法在医疗时间序列分析中的性能。

Method: 1) 输入层将多源临床特征映射到统一高维语义空间；2) 时间嵌入和对齐模块动态加权不规则采样数据；3) 多尺度特征提取模块通过多层卷积和分层融合捕获不同时间粒度的关键模式；4) 基于注意力的聚合机制整合全局时间依赖关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为高维异步医疗序列的智能表示提供了新解决方案，为EHR驱动的临床风险预测提供了重要技术支持。

Abstract: This study proposes a risk prediction method based on a Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) to address the challenges of temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in Electronic Health Records (EHR). The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis. This study provides a new solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and offers important technical support for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环肽是靶向细胞内位点的有前景模式，但细胞膜渗透性仍是关键瓶颈，且公共数据有限，需要良好校准的不确定性估计。

Method: 开发了MD-GAK核方法，将化学意义的残基相似性与序列对齐耦合，同时将局部匹配与间隙惩罚解耦；还提出了包含三角位置先验的PMD-GAK变体。使用高斯过程作为预测模型进行不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 提出的MD-GAK和PMD-GAK方法在环肽细胞膜渗透性预测中表现优异，特别是在数据稀缺和不确定性校准方面具有优势。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides are promising modalities for targeting intracellular sites; however, cell-membrane permeability remains a key bottleneck, exacerbated by limited public data and the need for well-calibrated uncertainty. Instead of relying on data-eager complex deep learning architecture, we propose a monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel (MD-GAK), which couples chemically meaningful residue-residue similarity with sequence alignment while decoupling local matches from gap penalties. MD-GAK is a relatively simple kernel. To further demonstrate the robustness of our framework, we also introduce a variant, PMD-GAK, which incorporates a triangular positional prior. As we will show in the experimental section, PMD-GAK can offer additional advantages over MD-GAK, particularly in reducing calibration errors. Since our focus is on uncertainty estimation, we use Gaussian Processes as the predictive model, as both MD-GAK and PMD-GAK can be directly applied within this framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through an extensive set of experiments, comparing our fully reproducible approach against state-of-the-art models, and show that it outperforms them across all metrics.

Abstract: Latent reasoning represents a new development in Transformer language models that has shown potential in compressing reasoning lengths compared to chain-of-thought reasoning. By directly passing the information-rich previous final latent state into the next sequence, latent reasoning removes the restriction to human language tokens as the medium for reasoning. We develop adaptive-length latent reasoning models and introduce a post-SFT reinforcement-learning methodology to optimize latent reasoning length by minimizing reasoning length while maintaining accuracy. This, in turn, further reduces compute usage and raises the bar on the compressive capabilities of latent reasoning models. Experiments on the Llama 3.2 1B model and the GSM8K-Aug dataset show a $52\%$ drop in total reasoning length with no penalty to accuracy. In future work, we plan to extend to additional models and datasets, analyze relationships between training coefficients, experiment with architecture variations, and continue our knowledge distillation for latent reasoning SFT efforts. We make our code and pretrained weights available at https://github.com/apning/adaptive-latent-reasoning.

Abstract: Smart grids are a fusion of classical power infrastructure and advanced communication networks and smart control, to create a cyber-physical environment that is more efficient and flexible than ever before. This integration causes vulnerabilities that can undermine grid stability as well as reliability. Digital forensics is a fundamental concept of learning and identifying, detecting, and mitigating such security incidents. This paper presents an all-in-one machine learning-based digital forensic framework of smart grid systems deployed on the Cloud. The framework combines the data acquisition at the sensor-level, authenticated communication, scalable cloud storage and automated forensic analytics. The model uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms - such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Trees and deep neural architectures for anomaly detection, event reconstruction and intrusion analysis in real time. After several simulation and experimental studies on real-time smart-meter data streams, the proposed framework is shown to be very accurate, scalable and resilient to cyber-attacks including data tampering, false-data injection and coordinated control-loop manipulation. The results indicate that cloud services are the best backbone for big-data-driven forensic workflows, which allows energy utilities to achieve a fast situational awareness and intelligent incident response.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art results across many natural language tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain difficult to interpret. In this work, we extract, process, and visualize latent state geometries in Transformer-based language models through dimensionality reduction. We capture layerwise activations at multiple points within Transformer blocks and enable systematic analysis through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP). We demonstrate experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMa models, where we uncover interesting geometric patterns in latent space. Notably, we identify a clear separation between attention and MLP component outputs across intermediate layers, a pattern not documented in prior work to our knowledge. We also characterize the high norm of latent states at the initial sequence position and visualize the layerwise evolution of latent states. Additionally, we demonstrate the high-dimensional helical structure of GPT-2's positional embeddings, the sequence-wise geometric patterns in LLaMa, and experiment with repeating token sequences. We aim to support systematic analysis of Transformer internals with the goal of enabling further reproducible interpretability research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法效率评估方法可能低估了真实进步，特别是当算法效率与计算规模相关时。需要重新评估2012-2023年间AI训练效率提升的真正来源。

Method: 进行小规模消融实验和扩展实验，比较LSTM和Transformer在不同计算规模下的效率，使用实验外推和文献估计来量化效率增益。

Result: 发现算法效率提升的22,000倍中，约6,930倍可被解释，其中LSTM到Transformer的规模依赖转换贡献了主要部分。小规模实验只能解释不到100倍的增益。

Conclusion: 算法效率的衡量具有强烈的参考依赖性，小规模模型的算法进步远低于先前假设，效率增益与计算规模密切相关。

Abstract: Algorithms have been estimated to increase AI training FLOP efficiency by a factor of 22,000 between 2012 and 2023 [Ho et al., 2024]. Running small-scale ablation experiments on key innovations from this time period, we are able to account for less than 10x of these gains. Surveying the broader literature, we estimate that additional innovations not included in our ablations account for less than 10x, yielding a total under 100x. This leads us to conduct scaling experiments, which reveal that much of this efficiency gap can be explained by algorithms with scale-dependent efficiency improvements. In particular, we conduct scaling experiments between LSTMs and Transformers, finding exponent differences in their compute-optimal scaling law while finding little scaling difference for many other innovations. These experiments demonstrate that - contrary to standard assumptions - an algorithm's efficiency gains are tied to compute scale. Using experimental extrapolation and literature estimates, we account for 6,930x efficiency gains over the same time period, with the scale-dependent LSTM-to-Transformer transition accounting for the majority of gains. Our results indicate that algorithmic progress for small models has been far slower than previously assumed, and that measures of algorithmic efficiency are strongly reference-dependent.

Conclusion: 神经网络在现实高维数据学习过程中会自发发展出有组织的、尺度不变的几何结构。

Abstract: Recent work by Freedman and Mulligan demonstrated that shallow multilayer perceptrons spontaneously develop Kolmogorov-Arnold geometric (KAG) structure during training on synthetic three-dimensional tasks. However, it remained unclear whether this phenomenon persists in realistic high-dimensional settings and what spatial properties this geometry exhibits.
  We extend KAG analysis to MNIST digit classification (784 dimensions) using 2-layer MLPs with systematic spatial analysis at multiple scales. We find that KAG emerges during training and appears consistently across spatial scales, from local 7-pixel neighborhoods to the full 28x28 image. This scale-agnostic property holds across different training procedures: both standard training and training with spatial augmentation produce the same qualitative pattern. These findings reveal that neural networks spontaneously develop organized, scale-invariant geometric structure during learning on realistic high-dimensional data.

Method: 对ViT-S、ViT-B和ViT-L在ImageNet上进行系统实证分析，使用信息搅乱指数量化信息混合模式。

Result: 发现深层ViT中信息-任务权衡出现更晚，额外层主要增加信息扩散而非提升任务性能；[CLS]令牌逐渐被补丁令牌分布式共识取代。

Conclusion: Transformer架构可能从精心校准的深度执行清晰阶段转换中获益更多，而非简单增加参数数量；信息搅乱指数可作为诊断工具和未来架构设计目标。

Abstract: Deeper Vision Transformers often perform worse than shallower ones, which challenges common scaling assumptions. Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count. The Information Scrambling Index provides a useful diagnostic for existing models and suggests a potential design target for future architectures.

Motivation: 优化LLMs在多轮目标导向对话中的表现面临挑战，包括稀疏的长时程奖励以及响应级规划与令牌级生成之间的差异。

Method: 将多轮RL问题形式化地简化为一系列单轮RLHF问题，使用学习到的多轮Q函数作为单轮问题的奖励模型，提出Iterative PPO算法交替进行Q函数拟合和策略改进。

Result: 证明了使用标准令牌级PPO解决单轮RL问题等价于在多轮问题中进行策略改进步骤。

Conclusion: Iterative PPO在完全在线和完全离线方法之间找到了平衡点，既保持了在线更新的适应性，又获得了离线训练的稳定性优势。

Abstract: Optimizing large language models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversational outcomes remains a significant challenge, especially in goal-oriented settings like AI marketing or sales agents who facilitate transactions via messaging platforms. The difficulty stems from sparse, long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we propose a formal reduction of the multi-turn RL problem into a sequence of single-turn RLHF-style problems. This is achieved by setting a learned multi-turn Q-function as the reward model for the single-turn problem. We demonstrate and prove a key insight: solving this single-turn RL problem with standard token-level PPO is equivalent to a policy improvement step within the multi-turn problem. This insight naturally leads to Iterative PPO, a batch online policy iteration algorithm that alternates between fitting Q-functions from logged conversation trajectories and improving the policy. A major practical advantage is that Iterative PPO directly leverages stable, off-the-shelf single-turn RLHF tools, making it straightforward to implement. Our method occupies a middle ground between fully online and fully offline approaches, retaining the adaptability of online updates while gaining the stability benefits of offline training.

Motivation: 当前编程代理容易通过硬编码测试用例或编辑测试文件等方式进行奖励黑客行为，需要系统化的评估方法来检测和衡量这种现象。

Method: 从LiveCodeBench获取问题，创建易于奖励黑客的环境，使用三种方法检测奖励黑客：保留单元测试、LLM评判器和测试文件编辑检测。

Result: LLM评判器在明确情况下能有效检测奖励黑客行为，保留测试用例的改进效果有限。Codex和Claude Code都表现出明确的奖励黑客行为，所有三个代理都显示出不匹配的行为。

Conclusion: 编程代理存在奖励黑客风险，LLM评判器是有效的检测工具，需要更好的对齐方法来防止奖励黑客行为。

Abstract: We introduce EvilGenie, a benchmark for reward hacking in programming settings. We source problems from LiveCodeBench and create an environment in which agents can easily reward hack, such as by hardcoding test cases or editing the testing files. We measure reward hacking in three ways: held out unit tests, LLM judges, and test file edit detection. We verify these methods against human review and each other. We find the LLM judge to be highly effective at detecting reward hacking in unambiguous cases, and observe only minimal improvement from the use of held out test cases. In addition to testing many models using Inspect's basic_agent scaffold, we also measure reward hacking rates for three popular proprietary coding agents: OpenAI's Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, and Google's Gemini CLI Using GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, respectively. We observe explicit reward hacking by both Codex and Claude Code, and misaligned behavior by all three agents. Our codebase can be found at https://github.com/JonathanGabor/EvilGenie.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason often relies on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with task-specific verifiers. However, many real-world reasoning-intensive tasks lack verifiers, despite offering abundant expert demonstrations that remain under-utilized for reasoning-focused training. We introduce RARO (Relativistic Adversarial Reasoning Optimization) that learns strong reasoning capabilities from only expert demonstrations via Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Our method sets up an adversarial interaction between a policy (generator) and a relativistic critic (discriminator): the policy learns to mimic expert answers, while the critic learns to compare and distinguish between policy and expert answers. Our method trains both the policy and the critic jointly and continuously via RL, and we identify the key stabilization techniques required for robust learning. Empirically, RARO significantly outperforms strong verifier-free baselines on all of our evaluation tasks -- Countdown, DeepMath, and Poetry Writing -- and enjoys the same robust scaling trends as RL on verifiable tasks. These results demonstrate that our method effectively elicits strong reasoning performance from expert demonstrations alone, enabling robust reasoning learning even when task-specific verifiers are unavailable.

Abstract: The rise of AI in telecommunications, from optimizing Radio Access Networks to managing user experience, has sharply increased data volumes and training demands. Telecom data is often noisy, high-dimensional, costly to store, process, and label. Despite Ai's critical role, standard workflows still assume all training samples contribute equally. On the other hand, next generation systems require AI models that are accurate, efficient, and sustainable.The paper questions the assumptions of equal importance by focusing on applying and analyzing the roles of individual samples in telecom training and assessing whether the proposed model optimizes computation and energy use. we perform sample-level gradient analysis across epochs to identify patterns of influence and redundancy in model learning. Based on this, we propose a sample importance framework thats electively prioritizes impactful data and reduces computation without compromising accuracy. Experiments on three real-world telecom datasets show that our method [reserves performance while reducing data needs and computational overhead while advancing the goals of sustainable AI in telecommunications.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high decoding latency and limited scalability across heterogeneous edge-cloud environments. Existing speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative decoding framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-target execution. Given the lack of prior work on simulating this paradigm, we first introduce DSD-Sim, a discrete-event simulator that captures network, batching, and scheduling dynamics. Building on insights from DSD-Sim, we further design an Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy that dynamically adjusts speculation window size to optimize throughput. Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable LLM serving across edge and cloud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征选择方法存在计算成本高、缺乏统计驱动的停止标准、重要性评分显著性评估不足等问题，需要一种具有理论基础的稳健方法。

Method: 引入多个随机噪声特征，通过非参数bootstrap假设检验框架评估每个特征相对于噪声特征最大重要性值的显著性。

Result: 在模拟数据集上比Boruta和Knockoff方法更好地恢复有意义信号；在真实数据集上超越Boruta、RFE和Extra Trees等方法。

Conclusion: 该方法作为稳健的特征选择算法，能够提取支持可靠推断、增强预测性能和高效计算的信息预测因子。

Abstract: Feature selection has remained a daunting challenge in machine learning and artificial intelligence, where increasingly complex, high-dimensional datasets demand principled strategies for isolating the most informative predictors. Despite widespread adoption, many established techniques suffer from notable limitations; some incur substantial computational cost, while others offer no definite statistical driven stopping criteria or assesses the significance of their importance scores. A common heuristic approach introduces multiple random noise features and retains all predictors ranked above the strongest noise feature. Although intuitive, this strategy lacks theoretical justification and depends heavily on heuristics. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method that addresses these limitations. Our approach introduces multiple random noise features and evaluates each feature's importance against the maximum importance value among these noise features incorporating a non-parametric bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework to establish a solid theoretical foundation. We establish the conceptual soundness of our approach through statistical derivations that articulate the principles guiding the design of our algorithm. To evaluate its reliability, we generated simulated datasets under controlled statistical settings and benchmarked performance against Boruta and Knockoff-based methods, observing consistently stronger recovery of meaningful signal. As a demonstration of practical utility, we applied the technique across diverse real-world datasets, where it surpassed feature selection techniques including Boruta, RFE, and Extra Trees. Hence, the method emerges as a robust algorithm for principled feature selection, enabling the distillation of informative predictors that support reliable inference, enhanced predictive performance, and efficient computation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释深度神经网络相比传统统计方法取得巨大成功的原因，探索DNNs是否实现了计算奥卡姆剃刀原理，即寻找拟合数据的最简单算法。

Method: 通过分析HTMC机制下函数近似的凸性特性，定义HTMC范数，并建立ResNet参数复杂度度量与HTMC范数之间的等价关系，证明最小化ResNet范数等价于寻找节点数接近最优的电路。

Result: 证明了HTMC范数与ResNet范数之间存在几乎匹配的夹逼界，表明最小化ResNet范数可在电路节点数上达到接近最优（在2的幂次范围内）的近似效果。

Conclusion: ResNets作为实数函数计算的替代模型，在HTMC机制下更适应其凸性特性，实现了计算奥卡姆剃刀原理，这解释了深度神经网络的成功。

Abstract: This paper argues that DNNs implement a computational Occam's razor -- finding the `simplest' algorithm that fits the data -- and that this could explain their incredible and wide-ranging success over more traditional statistical methods. We start with the discovery that the set of real-valued function $f$ that can be $ε$-approximated with a binary circuit of size at most $cε^{-γ}$ becomes convex in the `Harder than Monte Carlo' (HTMC) regime, when $γ>2$, allowing for the definition of a HTMC norm on functions. In parallel one can define a complexity measure on the parameters of a ResNets (a weighted $\ell_1$ norm of the parameters), which induce a `ResNet norm' on functions. The HTMC and ResNet norms can then be related by an almost matching sandwich bound. Thus minimizing this ResNet norm is equivalent to finding a circuit that fits the data with an almost minimal number of nodes (within a power of 2 of being optimal). ResNets thus appear as an alternative model for computation of real functions, better adapted to the HTMC regime and its convexity.

Motivation: 现代AI系统在不确定时经常静默失败，需要开发具有理论保证的后处理校准方法来提高决策可靠性。

Method: 将概率向量视为概率单纯形上的点，使用Fisher-Rao度量构建ALR校准映射，定义基于Fisher-Rao距离的可靠性分数，并构建中性区域用于延迟决策。

Result: 理论证明校准估计器的一致性(O_p(n^{-1/2}))和可靠性分数的紧集中界；在AAV分类实验中，两阶段框架捕获72.5%错误同时延迟34.5%样本。

Conclusion: 该工作连接信息几何与统计学习，为需要严格验证的应用提供形式化保证，几何校准的主要贡献在于理论基础而非经验优越性。

Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence systems make critical decisions yet often fail silently when uncertain. We develop a geometric framework for post-hoc calibration of neural network probability outputs, treating probability vectors as points on the $(c-1)$-dimensional probability simplex equipped with the Fisher--Rao metric. Our approach yields Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) calibration maps that reduce exactly to Platt scaling for binary problems (Proposition~1) while extending naturally to multi-class settings -- providing a principled generalization that existing methods lack. Complementing calibration, we define geometric reliability scores based on Fisher--Rao distance and construct neutral zones for principled deferral of uncertain predictions.
  Theoretical contributions include: (i) consistency of the calibration estimator at rate $O_p(n^{-1/2})$ via M-estimation theory (Theorem~1), and (ii) tight concentration bounds for reliability scores with explicit sub-Gaussian parameters enabling sample size calculations for validation set design (Theorem~2). We conjecture Neyman--Pearson optimality of our neutral zone construction based on connections to Bhattacharyya coefficients. Empirical validation on Adeno-Associated Virus classification demonstrates that the two-stage framework (calibration followed by reliability-based deferral) captures 72.5\% of errors while deferring 34.5\% of samples. Notably, this operational gain is achievable with any well-calibrated probability output; the contribution of geometric calibration lies in its theoretical foundations rather than empirical superiority over simpler alternatives. This work bridges information geometry and statistical learning, offering formal guarantees relevant to applications requiring rigorous validation.

Abstract: This paper investigates the partial linear model by Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) regression. We parameterize the nonparametric term using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and formulate a penalized LAD problem for estimation. Specifically, our model exhibits the following challenges. First, the regularization term can be nonconvex and nonsmooth, necessitating the introduction of infinite dimensional variational analysis and nonsmooth analysis into the asymptotic normality discussion. Second, our network must expand (in width, sparsity level and depth) as more samples are observed, thereby introducing additional difficulties for theoretical analysis. Third, the oracle of the proposed estimator is itself defined through a ultra high-dimensional, nonconvex, and discontinuous optimization problem, which already entails substantial computational and theoretical challenges. Under such the challenges, we establish the consistency, convergence rate, and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Furthermore, we analyze the oracle problem itself and its continuous relaxation. We study the convergence of a proximal subgradient method for both formulations, highlighting their structural differences lead to distinct computational subproblems along the iterations. In particular, the relaxed formulation admits significantly cheaper proximal updates, reflecting an inherent trade-off between statistical accuracy and computational tractability.

Conclusion: 这项工作为可能性理论框架下的变分推断提供了理论基础，展示了在处理稀疏或不精确信息时可能性方法的鲁棒性和可解释性优势。

Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a cornerstone of modern Bayesian learning, enabling approximate inference in complex models that would otherwise be intractable. However, its formulation depends on expectations and divergences defined through high-dimensional integrals, often rendering analytical treatment impossible and necessitating heavy reliance on approximate learning and inference techniques. Possibility theory, an imprecise probability framework, allows to directly model epistemic uncertainty instead of leveraging subjective probabilities. While this framework provides robustness and interpretability under sparse or imprecise information, adapting VI to the possibilistic setting requires rethinking core concepts such as entropy and divergence, which presuppose additivity. In this work, we develop a principled formulation of possibilistic variational inference and apply it to a special class of exponential-family functions, highlighting parallels with their probabilistic counterparts and revealing the distinctive mathematical structures of possibility theory.

Conclusion: 在中等稀疏机制下，最优算法与谱方法有根本性不同，本文结果完善了多社区情况下社区恢复的计算障碍理论。

Abstract: A fundamental theoretical question in network analysis is to determine under which conditions community recovery is possible in polynomial time in the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). When the number $K$ of communities remains smaller than $\sqrt{n}$ --where $n$ denotes the number of nodes--, non-trivial community recovery is possible in polynomial time above, and only above, the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold, originally postulated using arguments from statistical physics.
  When $K \geq \sqrt{n}$, Chin, Mossel, Sohn, and Wein recently proved that, in the \emph{sparse regime}, community recovery in polynomial time is achievable below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths. This finding led them to postulate a new threshold for the many-communities regime $K \geq \sqrt{n}$. Subsequently, Carpentier, Giraud, and Verzelen established the failure of low-degree polynomials below this new threshold across all density regimes, and demonstrated successful recovery above the threshold in certain moderately sparse settings. While these results provide strong evidence that, in the many community setting, the computational barrier lies at the threshold proposed in~Chin et al., the question of achieving recovery above this threshold still remains open in most density regimes.
  The present work is a follow-up to~Carpentier et al., in which we prove Conjecture~1.4 stated therein by: \\ 1- Constructing a family of motifs satisfying specific structural properties; and\\ 2- Proving that community recovery is possible above the proposed threshold by counting such motifs.\\ Our results complete the picture of the computational barrier for community recovery in the SBM with $K \geq \sqrt{n}$ communities. They also indicate that, in moderately sparse regimes, the optimal algorithms appear to be fundamentally different from spectral methods.

*Sadegh Shirani,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于演化方法的因果效应估计框架，用于处理网络系统中的干扰效应，无需恢复确切的网络结构，而是通过观察结果在干预下的演化模式来估计总体因果效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在网络系统中，干预对某一单元的影响会溢出到其他单元，而复杂的物理或社会系统中的相互作用路径通常无法观测。传统方法需要恢复网络结构，但本文认为识别总体因果效应无需精确网络结构，只需表征相互作用如何影响结果演化。

Method: 采用基于演化的方法，研究结果在多个观察轮次中如何随干预变化，从而补偿缺失的网络信息。使用暴露映射视角，给出结果经验分布遵循低维递归方程的公理化特征，并识别存在此类演化映射的最小结构条件。该方法被视为分布层面的双重差分法。

Result: 该方法能够一致地学习异质性溢出效应，特别是在密集网络中的因果消息传递，以及扩展到更一般的干扰结构，包括影响者网络（少数单元驱动大部分溢出）。

Conclusion: 治疗随机化不仅消除潜在混杂，还诱导从隐藏干扰通道的隐式采样，使得能够一致估计异质性溢出效应。但强时间趋势或内生干扰可能破坏识别。

Abstract: Causal effect estimation in networked systems is central to data-driven decision making. In such settings, interventions on one unit can spill over to others, and in complex physical or social systems, the interaction pathways driving these interference structures remain largely unobserved. We argue that for identifying population-level causal effects, it is not necessary to recover the exact network structure; instead, it suffices to characterize how those interactions contribute to the evolution of outcomes. Building on this principle, we study an evolution-based approach that investigates how outcomes change across observation rounds in response to interventions, hence compensating for missing network information. Using an exposure-mapping perspective, we give an axiomatic characterization of when the empirical distribution of outcomes follows a low-dimensional recursive equation, and identify minimal structural conditions under which such evolution mappings exist. We frame this as a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences. Rather than assuming parallel paths for individual units, it exploits parallel evolution patterns across treatment scenarios to estimate counterfactual trajectories. A key insight is that treatment randomization plays a role beyond eliminating latent confounding; it induces an implicit sampling from hidden interference channels, enabling consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects. We highlight causal message passing as an instantiation of this method in dense networks while extending to more general interference structures, including influencer networks where a small set of units drives most spillovers. Finally, we discuss the limits of this approach, showing that strong temporal trends or endogenous interference can undermine identification.
