### [1] [Comparative Analysis of Attention Mechanisms for Automatic Modulation Classification in Radio Frequency Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09996)
*Ferhat Ozgur Catak,Murat Kuzlu,Umit Cali*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种注意力机制（多头注意力、因果注意力和稀疏注意力）与CNN结合在RF信号分类中的表现，提出了一种新型CNN-Transformer混合架构，实验结果显示多头注意力精度最高，但因果和稀疏注意力在计算效率上优势显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动调制分类（AMC）在认知无线电系统和频谱管理中至关重要，研究旨在探索不同注意力机制在RF信号分类中的效果。

Method: 提出了一种CNN-Transformer混合架构，利用不同注意力模式（多头、因果、稀疏）分析RML2016.10a数据集中的I/Q样本。

Result: 多头注意力精度最高（85.05%），因果和稀疏注意力分别减少83%和75%的推理时间，同时保持84%以上的分类性能。

Conclusion: 不同调制方案对注意力模式有偏好，研究为实时无线电信号处理中的高效注意力机制设计提供了参考。

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a critical component in
cognitive radio systems and spectrum management applications. This study
presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of three attention mechanisms
(i.e., baseline multi-head attention, causal attention, and sparse attention)
integrated with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for radio frequency (RF)
signal classification. It proposes a novel CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture
that leverages different attention patterns to capture temporal dependencies in
I/Q samples from the RML2016.10a dataset. The experimental results demonstrate
that while baseline attention achieves the highest accuracy of 85.05\%, causal
and sparse attention mechanisms offer significant computational advantages with
inference times reduced by 83\% and 75\% respectively, while maintaining
competitive classification performance above 84\%. The analysis reveals
distinct attention pattern preferences across different modulation schemes,
providing insights for designing efficient attention mechanisms for real-time
radio signal processing applications.

### [2] [Information Retention in Iterative Random Projection of Convex Bodies to Lower Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10218)
*Nazanin Mirhosseini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了有界凸体通过两次随机正交投影后的信息保留问题，推导了条件互信息的上界，并推广到多次投影的情况，探讨了凸体对称性对信息保留的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索高维空间中凸体通过随机投影降维后的信息保留能力，为理解降维过程中的信息损失提供理论支持。

Method: 通过两次随机正交投影将凸体从n维降到n-2维，推导条件互信息的上界，并推广到多次投影的情况。

Result: 得出了条件互信息的上界，并发现凸体的对称性会影响该上界的可达性。

Conclusion: 凸体的对称性在多次随机投影中对信息保留有显著影响，为高维数据降维提供了理论指导。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a bounded convex body $K_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$
subjected to two successive random orthogonal projections onto
$\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$, respectively. First, we project
$K_0$ orthogonally onto $U_{1}^{\perp}$, the orthogonal complement of
$\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_1$, where $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_1$ is uniformly
distributed on the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$. This yields a random convex body $K_1
= \mathrm{Proj}_{{U_1}^{\perp}}(K_0) \subset \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. We then repeat
the process, projecting $K_1$ orthogonally onto ${U}_{2}^{\perp}$, the
orthogonal complement of $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_2$ chosen uniformly from the
unit sphere in $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_{1}^{\perp}$ or $S^{n-2}$, resulting in a
second random convex body $K_2 = \mathrm{Proj}_{{U_2}^{\perp}}(K_1) \subset
\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$. To quantify information retention through these sequential
dimension reductions, we derive an upper bound for the conditional mutual
information $I(K_1;K_2 \mid K_0)$. Furthermore, we extend this process to $m$
iterations and generalize the upper bound on $I(K_1;K_2 \mid K_0)$ to establish
an analogous upper bound for $I(K_1;K_m \mid K_0)$. Finally, we examine the
influence of $K_0$'s symmetry on the achievability of this upper bound for
$I(K_1;K_m \mid K_0)$.

### [3] [A Deep Learning based Signal Dimension Estimator with Single Snapshot Signal in Phased Array Radar Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10263)
*Yugang Ma,Yonghong Zeng,Sumei Sun,Gary Lee,Ernest Kurniawan,Francois Chin Po Shin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的信号维度估计方法（DLSDE），适用于单次观测的相控阵雷达，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信号维度是许多高分辨率延迟估计和方向寻找算法的前提，正确估计信号维度至关重要。

Method: 使用二维卷积神经网络（2D-CNN）自动提取信号维度特征，无需依赖特征分解和信息准则。

Result: DLSDE在成功检测率和分辨率上显著优于传统方法，检测信噪比提升>15dB，分辨率提升>1°。

Conclusion: DLSDE适用于空间相关或角度分离小的信号，且仅需单次观测信号，优于现有深度学习方法。

Abstract: Signal dimension, defined here as the number of copies with different delays
or angular shifts, is a prerequisite for many high-resolution delay estimation
and direction-finding algorithms in sensing and communication systems. Thus,
correctly estimating signal dimension itself becomes crucial. In this paper, we
present a deep learning-based signal dimension estimator (DLSDE) with
single-snapshot observation in the example application of phased array radar.
Unlike traditional model-based and existing deep learning-based signal
dimension estimators relying on eigen-decomposition and information criterion,
to which multiple data snapshots would be needed, the proposed DLSDE uses
two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) to automatically develop
features corresponding to the dimension of the received signal. Our study shows
that DLSDE significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of the
successful detection rate and resolution. In a phased array radar with 32
antenna elements, DLSDE improves detection Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) by >15dB
and resolution by >1{\deg}. This makes the proposed method suitable for
distinguishing multiple signals that are spatially correlated or have small
angular separation. More importantly, our solution operates with a single
snapshot signal, which is incompatible with other existing deep learning-based
methods.

### [4] [Environment Reconstruction in Terahertz Monostatic Sensing: Joint Millimeter-level Geometry Mapping and Material Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10372)
*Zitong Fang,Yejian Lyu,Ziming Yu,Chong Han*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种高效的计算框架，用于太赫兹（THz）环境重建，结合了连通分量分析（CCA）辅助的多径分量（MPC）估计和滑动窗口细化策略，实现了毫米级几何映射和可靠的材料分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太赫兹集成传感与通信（ISAC）需要高精度环境感知能力，但现有方法计算复杂且精度不足。本文旨在通过高效算法提升环境重建的精度和速度。

Method: 采用CCA辅助的MPC估计加速参数提取，结合滑动窗口细化策略优化几何映射。通过反射损失分析分类确定性/随机性信道成分，并利用THz-TDS数据库进行材料识别。

Result: 实验显示，几何映射的平均距离误差为4.9毫米，比文献提升一个数量级；材料分类准确可靠。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了THz ISAC系统的环境感知能力，为高精度传感与通信提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) offers high-speed
communication alongside precise environmental sensing. This paper presents a
computationally efficient framework for THz-based environment reconstruction by
integrating connected component analysis (CCA)-assisted multipath component
(MPC) estimation with a sliding-window refinement strategy. To start with, a
monostatic sensing experiment is conducted in an indoor scenario using a vector
network analyzer (VNA)-based sounder operating from 290 to 310 GHz. On one
hand, as for geometry mapping, a CCA-based region search is employed to
accelerate parameter extraction, significantly reducing the search space for
space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE)-based estimation
and achieving an 8.4 times acceleration, while preserving resolution. Further
analysis of the connected component structure enables the identification of
indoor features such as flat walls and corners. A sliding-window refinement
applied to the identified regions improves geometric mapping, achieving the
mean distance error of 4.9 mm, which is one order of magnitude better than the
literature. On the other hand, the deterministic and stochastic components of
the monostatic channel are classified through reflection loss analysis. Then,
material identification is performed by looking up the reflection loss in a THz
time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) database, which comprises over 200 materials
across a 0-6 THz range. Experimental results validate millimeter-level accuracy
in geometry mapping and reliable material classification, enhancing the
environmental awareness capabilities of THz ISAC systems.

### [5] [Interleaved Transceiver Design for a Continuous- Transmission MIMO-OFDM ISAC System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10430)
*Yating Chen,Cai Wen,Yan Huang,Jinye Peng,Wei Hong,Timothy N. Davidson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于OFDM波形的MIMO ISAC系统的交错收发设计方法，优化了传输信号和接收滤波器，兼顾通信和雷达性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MIMO ISAC系统中通信与雷达性能的协同优化问题，同时应对硬件实现中的挑战。

Result: 数值仿真验证了设计在通信和雷达性能上的有效性，且算法计算效率高。

Conclusion: 该方法在MIMO ISAC系统中实现了通信与雷达性能的平衡，且计算效率高。

Abstract: This paper proposes an interleaved transceiver design method for a
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) system utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
waveforms. We consider a continuous transmission system and focus on the design
of the transmission signal and a receiving filter in the time domain for an
interleaved transmission architecture. For communication performance,
constructive interference (CI) is integrated into the optimization problem. For
radar sensing performance, the integrated mainlobe-to-sidelobe ratio (IMSR) of
the beampattern is considered to ensure desirable directivity. Additionally, we
tackle the challenges of inter-block interference and eliminate the spurious
peaks, which are crucial for accurate target detection. Regarding the hardware
implementation aspect, the power of each time sample is constrained to manage
the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). The design problem is addressed using
an alternating optimization (AO) framework, with the subproblem for transmitted
waveform design being solved via the successive convex approximation (SCA)
method. To further enhance computational efficiency, the alternate direction
penalty method (ADPM) is employed to solve the subproblems within the SCA
iterations. The convergence of ADPM is established, with convergence of the
case of more than two auxiliary variables being established for the first time.
Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of our transceiver design in
achieving desirable performance in both radar sensing and communication, with
the fast algorithm achieving comparable performance with greater computational
efficiency.

### [6] [Second Order Channel Statistics: An Analysis for Optimal Single-user RIS Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10476)
*Amy S. Inwood,Peter J. Smith,Philippa A. Martin,Graeme K. Woodward*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了可重构智能表面（RIS）系统中信道状态信息获取的挑战，通过二阶统计量分析了单用户RIS系统的时空行为，推导了信道衰落率和平均衰落持续时间，并验证了RIS对信道变化的放大作用不明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 被动RIS无法生成导频信号或处理数据，导致信道快速变化时难以获取信道状态信息，同时RIS信道的空间变化影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 假设RIS与基站之间存在视距链路，推导了RIS链路的衰落率精确表达式，并提出了全局信道衰落率的数值稳定近似方法，进一步分析了时空相关性。

Result: 通过仿真验证了所有分析结果，并研究了关键系统参数的影响，发现RIS的使用不会显著放大信道变化。

Conclusion: RIS在信道变化中的放大作用有限，为RIS系统的设计和优化提供了理论支持。

Abstract: A key challenge facing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is channel
state information acquisition. Passive RISs cannot generate pilot signals or
process data, making rapid temporal changes in the channel problematic.
Additionally, the impact of spatial changes in RIS channels has not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, in this work, we use second order
statistics to investigate the spatio-temporal behaviour of a single-user (SU)
RIS system. Assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) RIS to base station (BS) link, we
derive an exact expression for the level crossing rate (LCR) of the RIS link
(user equipment (UE)-RIS-BS path) and propose a numerically stable
approximation for the LCR of the global UE-BS channel. Each LCR expression
attained is then utilised to find the corresponding average fade duration
(AFD). The temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) correlation is also derived
assuming an LoS RIS-BS link. Assuming a Ricean RIS-BS link, expressions for the
spatial correlation matrix of the global channel and the mean SNR loss due to
channel ageing are derived. All of the analyses are verified by simulation, and
the impact of key system parameters is investigated. We show that the use of an
RIS does not significantly amplify changes in the channel.

Conclusion: Ricean K因子对CFAS性能有显著影响，信道变化是实现高HSP的关键因素。

Abstract: We consider a single-user (SU) continuous fluid antenna system (CFAS)
employing matched filtering (MF) operating over a Ricean fading channel.
Focusing on the upper tail of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
distribution (the high SNR probability (HSP)), we derive accurate
approximations for the HSP in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions using the expected Euler
characteristic (EEC), presenting the first analytical results for a CFAS in a
Ricean environment. In the process, we provide the first closed-form expression
for the Euler characteristic density of a non-central chi-squared random field.
We then examine the impact of the Ricean K-factor on the CFAS performance,
emphasizing the critical role of channel variations in achieving a strong HSP.

Motivation: 探讨不同方法在雷达截面测量中的表现，以优化数据分析和提取部分目标的雷达截面。

Method: 使用反投影和迭代平滑重加权ℓ1最小化两种方法分析雷达截面测量数据。

Result: 反投影方法稳健且准确，但受限于分辨率；迭代方法适用于密集散射体，但精度较低。

Conclusion: 反投影适合高精度需求，而迭代方法更适合处理密集散射体，但需权衡精度与分辨率。

Abstract: Radar Cross Section measurement data is often analyzed using Inverse
Synthetic Aperture Radar images. This paper compares backprojection and
iterative smooth reweighted $\ell_1$-minimization as methods to analyze radar
cross section measurements and extract radar cross section for parts of the
measured object. The main conclusion is that using backprojection images to
extract RCS is robust and accurate but is more limited by the resolution than
iterative smooth reweighted $\ell_1$-minimization. The latter method can be
used for closely spaced scatterers but is limited in accuracy.

### [9] [Unsupervised Deep Equilibrium Model Learning for Large-Scale Channel Estimation with Performance Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10546)

  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 理论证明在温和条件下可实现与监督学习相当的性能，实验验证显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督框架在缺乏真实信道时仍能保证性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning methods have shown promise for large-scale channel
estimation (LCE), but their reliance on ground-truth channel labels greatly
limits their practicality in real-world systems. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised learning framework for LCE that does not require ground-truth
channels. The proposed approach leverages Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk
Estimate (GSURE) as a principled unsupervised loss function, which provides an
unbiased estimate of the projected mean-squared error (PMSE) from compressed
noisy measurements. To ensure a guaranteed performance, we integrate a deep
equilibrium (DEQ) model, which implicitly represents an infinite-depth network
by directly learning the fixed point of a parameterized iterative process. We
theoretically prove that, under mild conditions, the proposed GSURE-based
unsupervised DEQ learning can achieve oracle-level supervised performance. In
particular, we show that the DEQ architecture inherently enforces a
compressible solution. We then demonstrate that DEQ-induced compressibility
ensures that optimizing the projected error via GSURE suffices to guarantee a
good MSE performance, enabling a rigorous performance guarantee. Extensive
simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly outperforms various baselines when ground-truth channel
is unavailable.

### [10] [Compressive Spectral Imaging in View of Earth Observation Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10569)
*Clément Thomas,Laurent Jacques,Marc Georges*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文探讨了用经典折射透镜替代压缩光谱成像系统中的衍射透镜的可行性，以降低成本并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测仪器通常复杂且昂贵，压缩光谱成像是一种更经济高效的技术。

Method: 利用折射透镜的色差特性替代衍射透镜，并通过模拟验证可行性，信号恢复采用Douglas-Rashford算法。

Result: 研究表明，折射透镜可以替代衍射透镜，降低系统成本。

Conclusion: 折射透镜在压缩光谱成像中具有潜力，为地球观测提供更经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Earth observation from space is an important scientific and industrial
activity that has applications in many sectors. The instruments employed are
often large, complex, and expensive. In addition, they generate large amounts
of data, which is challenging for storage and transfer purposes. Compressive
spectral imaging would be a cheaper, more efficient, and well-adapted technique
to perform Earth observation. An interesting architecture is compressive
spectral imaging with diffractive lenses, which is extremely compact. This work
investigates the possibility of replacing the diffractive lens in this system
with a classical refractive lens. Taking advantage of the chromatic aberration
of a lens makes the use of expensive diffractive lenses unnecessary.
Simulations are performed to test the feasibility of the method. Signal
recovery is a basis pursuit solved using the Douglas-Rashford algorithm.

Result: 混合导航显著提高了精度，尤其是在有静态用户的情况下，结合参考站时仅需两颗可见卫星即可实现亚米级精度。

Conclusion: 混合PNT方法为月球任务提供了高精度导航解决方案，特别是在卫星覆盖不足的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) are crucial for upcoming
lunar surface missions. Lunar satellite navigation systems are being developed,
but lack coverage during early deployment phases. Hybrid lunar PNT combining
cooperative navigation, satellite systems, and an optional reference station
offers improved accuracy and availability. This study develops realistic error
models that incorporate temporal correlations often ignored in existing works.
We derive a cooperative navigation error model considering fading and
pseudorange bias from multipath propagation, and compare three error models for
lunar satellite pseudorange and pseudorange rate signal-in-space error. These
temporal error correlation models integrate easily into Kalman filters and
provide realistic performance predictions essential for robust navigation
engines. We perform case studies to demonstrate that hybrid navigation
significantly improves accuracy, particularly with static users present. Most
notably, hybrid navigation enables optimal performance when using a lunar
reference station, achieving sub-meter accuracy with only two visible
satellites.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在提高集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统的频谱效率和感知性能。

Result: AFDM-PLIM的频谱效率和感知性能优于传统AFDM-IM技术。

Conclusion: AFDM-PLIM在保持高频谱效率的同时，显著提升了感知性能。

Abstract: This study proposes an index modulation (IM) technique for affine frequency
division multiplexing (AFDM) signals and examines its communication and sensing
performance toward integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The
power levels of subcarriers are utilized as modulation indices while also
transmitting data symbols within each subcarrier. Thus, the proposed AFDM with
subcarrier power-level index modulation (AFDM-PLIM) maintains all subcarriers
active at all times to achieve a higher spectral efficiency compared to other
AFDM-IM techniques, where some of the subcarriers are turned off for IM. A low
complexity estimator and subcarrier grouping are also proposed to reduce the
computational complexity of the maximum likelihood estimator. Furthermore, this
study also examines the delay and Doppler ambiguity functions of the proposed
AFDM-PLIM and evaluates its range estimation performance. The results show that
its sensing performance is better than AFDM-IM waveforms due to keeping all
subcarriers active at all times.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了PPG信号质量，为心血管疾病监测提供了创新工具。

Abstract: Objective. Wearable devices with embedded photoplethysmography (PPG) enable
continuous non-invasive monitoring of cardiac activity, offering a promising
strategy to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. However,
monitoring during daily life introduces motion artifacts that can compromise
the signals. Traditional signal decomposition techniques often fail with severe
artifacts. Deep learning denoisers are more effective but have poorer
interpretability, which is critical for clinical acceptance. This study
proposes a framework that combines the advantages of both signal decomposition
and deep learning approaches. Approach. We leverage algorithm unfolding to
integrate prior knowledge about the PPG structure into a deep neural network,
improving its interpretability. A learned convolutional sparse coding model
encodes the signal into a sparse representation using a learned dictionary of
kernels that capture recurrent morphological patterns. The network is trained
for denoising using the PulseDB dataset and a synthetic motion artifact model
from the literature. Performance is benchmarked with PPG during daily
activities using the PPG-DaLiA dataset and compared with two reference deep
learning methods. Main results. On the synthetic dataset, the proposed method,
on average, improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from -7.07 dB to 11.23 dB
and reduced the heart rate mean absolute error (MAE) by 55%. On the PPG-DaLiA
dataset, the MAE decreased by 23%. The proposed method obtained higher SNR and
comparable MAE to the reference methods. Significance. Our method effectively
enhances the quality of PPG signals from wearable devices and enables the
extraction of meaningful waveform features, which may inspire innovative tools
for monitoring cardiovascular diseases.

Conclusion: 提出的流体天线结构和DOA估计方法有效解决了信号对齐和非对齐问题，为无线通信提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fluid antenna (FA) technology has emerged as a promising approach in wireless
communications due to its capability of providing increased degrees of freedom
(DoFs) and exceptional design flexibility. This paper addresses the challenge
of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for aligned received signals (ARS) and
non-aligned received signals (NARS) by designing two specialized uniform FA
structures under time-constrained mobility. For ARS scenarios, we propose a
fully movable antenna configuration that maximizes the virtual array aperture,
whereas for NARS scenarios, we design a structure incorporating a fixed
reference antenna to reliably extract phase information from the signal
covariance. To overcome the limitations of large virtual arrays and limited
sample data inherent in time-varying channels (TVC), we introduce two novel DOA
estimation methods: TMRLS-MUSIC for ARS, combining Toeplitz matrix
reconstruction (TMR) with linear shrinkage (LS) estimation, and TMR-MUSIC for
NARS, utilizing sub-covariance matrices to construct virtual array responses.
Both methods employ Nystrom approximation to significantly reduce computational
complexity while maintaining estimation accuracy. Theoretical analyses and
extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
underdetermined DOA estimation using minimal FA elements, outperform
conventional methods in estimation accuracy, and substantially reduce
computational complexity.

innovation not only facilitates the seamless application of super-resolution
DOA estimators but also enables robust DOA estimation, accurately localizing
more sources than the number of physical antenna elements. We introduce two
bespoke FA array structures and mobility strategies tailored to scenarios with
aligned and misaligned received signals, respectively, demonstrating a
hardware-driven approach to overcoming complexities typically addressed by
intricate algorithms. A key contribution is a light-of-sight (LoS)-centric,
closed-form DOA estimator, which first employs an eigenvalue-ratio test for
precise LoS path number detection, followed by a polynomial root-finding
procedure. This method distinctly showcases the unique advantages of FAS by
simplifying the estimation process while enhancing accuracy. Numerical results
compellingly verify that the proposed FA array designs and estimation
techniques yield an extended DoF range, deliver superior DOA accuracy, and
maintain robustness across diverse signal conditions.

Abstract: Most existing antenna array-based source localization methods rely on
fixed-position arrays (FPAs) and strict assumptions about source field
conditions (near-field or far-field), which limits their effectiveness in
complex, dynamic real-world scenarios where high-precision localization is
required. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel scalable fluid antenna
system (SFAS) that can dynamically adjust its aperture configuration to
optimize performance for different localization tasks. Within this framework,
we develop a two-stage source localization strategy based on the exact spatial
geometry (ESG) model: the first stage uses a compact aperture configuration for
initial direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, while the second stage employs
an expanded aperture for enhanced DOA and range estimation. The proposed
approach eliminates the traditional need for signal separation or isolation to
classify source types and enables a single SFAS array to achieve high
localization accuracy without field-specific assumptions, model
simplifications, or approximations, representing a new paradigm in array-based
source localization. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method in terms of localization accuracy, computational efficiency,
and robustness to different source types.

Abstract: Air-based molecular communication (MC) has the potential to be one of the
first MC systems to be deployed in real-world applications, enabled by existing
sensor technologies such as metal-oxide semi-conductor (MOS) sensors. However,
commercially available sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive
behavior, contrary to the idealizing assumptions about linear and perfectly
molecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature. To address this
gap, we propose a detector for molecule mixture communication with a general
non-linear, cross-reactive receiver (RX) array that performs approximate
maximum likelihood detection on the sensor outputs. Additionally, we introduce
an algorithm for the design of mixture alphabets that accounts for the RX
characteristics. We evaluate our detector and alphabet design algorithm through
simulations that are based on measurements reported for two commercial MOS
sensors. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed detector achieves
similar symbol error rates as data-driven methods without requiring large
numbers of training samples and that the alphabet design algorithm outperforms
methods that do not account for the RX characteristics. Since the proposed
detector and alphabet design algorithm are also applicable to other chemical
sensors, they pave the way for reliable air-based MC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpenFPL是一个开源工具，旨在通过公开数据提供高精度的Fantasy Premier League球员表现预测，其准确性可与商业服务媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高精度预测仅限于依赖专有数据的商业服务，OpenFPL旨在通过公开数据实现预测的民主化。

Method: OpenFPL基于2020-21至2023-24赛季的公开数据，开发了位置特定的集成模型。

Result: OpenFPL在2024-25赛季的测试中表现与领先商业服务相当，且在高回报球员预测上更优。

Conclusion: OpenFPL为玩家提供了长期规划和短期决策的可靠工具，推动了预测技术的开放共享。

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

Conclusion: xRFM不仅性能优越，还通过平均梯度外积提供原生可解释性。

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

Result: 集成模型在保持或提升预测精度的同时，显著提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁进一步研究生产系统中预测模型的稳定性问题。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且实用，适用于扩散模型的形式语言约束解码。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT在计算效率和性能之间取得了平衡，适用于大规模模型训练。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied
to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time
series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning
pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

Result: 框架在保持边际覆盖率的同时减少了预测区间长度，提供了短期精确预测和长期更宽范围的预测。

Conclusion: 通过量化不确定性，该方法支持基于证据的左旋多巴剂量决策，优化症状控制并减少副作用，提高生活质量。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了推理语言模型的评估方法，指出性能提升不仅来自算法改进或模型规模，还依赖于有影响力的基准测试作为学习课程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理成为大型语言模型的新扩展维度，需要深入研究其在关键任务中的能力。

Method: 通过基准驱动的选择（benchmark-driven selection）研究模型性能，并以DeepSeek-R1为例，结合Humanity's Last Exam的顺序决策问题进行分析。

Result: 研究发现，有影响力的基准测试可以作为训练课程，而非仅用于测试，从而提升模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过基准测试引导AI发展，将评估转化为学习，强调了测试任务的新颖性对衡量推理模型泛化能力的重要性。

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAM的隐式正则化在张量化和尺度不变模型中的行为研究不足，本文通过尺度不变性分析SAM的范数动态，提出了一种新的方法DAS，性能优于SAM且计算开销更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SAM在更一般的张量化和尺度不变模型中的行为，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 利用尺度不变性分析SAM的范数动态，提出Norm Deviation作为全局度量，并基于梯度流分析其演化。提出DAS方法，显式模拟SAM的隐式正则化行为。

Result: DAS在张量补全、噪声训练、模型压缩和参数高效微调等任务中表现优于或与SAM相当，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: DAS是一种简单有效的方法，能够显式模拟SAM的隐式正则化行为，并在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by
dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This
work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable
machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

Motivation: 未观察到的混杂因素会导致因果效应估计偏差，影响观测研究的可靠性。推荐系统虽依赖完全观测数据，但某些实践可能忽略特征，引入类似问题。

Result: 研究表明这些实践确实会引入混杂，影响推荐系统性能。

Conclusion: 论文建议实践者采取措施减少或避免混杂因素，提升推荐系统效果。

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

Conclusion: AI在手写标记分析中的应用为野生动物取证提供了新工具，有助于打击有组织野生动物犯罪。

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from
discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function
$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when
the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we
propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural
$\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete
neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning
objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the
continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of
MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and
potential of the proposed framework.

Motivation: 现有图神经网络（GNN）异常检测方法可能放大数据中的偏见，导致不公平结果，而现有公平性研究多集中于节点分类任务，缺乏针对自动编码器结构的异常检测公平性解决方案。

Method: 提出DECAF-GAD框架，使用结构因果模型（SCM）分离敏感属性，设计专用自动编码器架构和公平性导向的损失函数。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，DECAF-GAD在异常检测性能和公平性指标上均显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DECAF-GAD有效解决了自动编码器图异常检测中的公平性问题，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is

Result: 提出的方法显著提高了样本效率，适用于大规模状态-动作空间。

Conclusion: 该方法在多目标强化学习中有效提升了策略梯度的样本效率，且无需严格假设。

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy
gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种可解释的机器学习模型，用于早期预测肝硬化危重患者的急性肾损伤（AKI），LightGBM表现最佳，具有高准确性和负预测值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝硬化患者中AKI发生率高且预后差，现有预测工具准确性不足且与ICU工作流程不匹配，因此需要开发更准确的早期预测模型。

Method: 研究回顾性分析了MIMIC-IV v2.2数据库，提取前48小时的实验室和生理变量，通过预处理、特征选择和算法训练（包括LightGBM等六种方法）构建模型。

Result: LightGBM表现最佳（AUROC 0.808，准确率0.704，NPV 0.911），关键预测因子与肝硬化-AKI机制一致。

Conclusion: 该模型能准确早期预测AKI风险，高NPV支持低风险患者的安全降级，可解释性增强了临床信任，需进一步外部验证和电子病历系统集成。

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

Motivation: 高斯过程在回归和系统识别中广泛应用，但其计算复杂度限制了其在小数据集上的适用性，尤其是在流式场景中。在线高斯过程通过限制数据点数量和移除冗余数据点来解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 该工作为在线高斯过程算法的实际应用提供了指导，尤其是在处理流式数据时。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

Result: 结果表明Transformer模型能够成功学习并推断出密码函数的隐藏映射。

Conclusion: 结论是ICL在密码学任务中具有潜力，Transformer模型能够有效处理结构化推理挑战。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer后门攻击方法需重新训练或改变架构，资源消耗大且侵入性强，HPMI旨在解决这些问题。

Method: HPMI通过修剪最不重要头并注入预训练恶意头建立后门，无需重新训练。

Result: 实验显示HPMI在攻击成功率（≥99.55%）、隐蔽性和防御绕过方面表现优异，且对干净数据精度影响极小。

Conclusion: HPMI是一种高效、隐蔽且资源友好的Transformer后门攻击方法，优于现有依赖重新训练的方法。

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud
computing environments.

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

Motivation: 现有在线学习方法未能有效利用重复偏移，而基于模型池的方法难以捕捉单个源组件，导致适应性能不佳。

Method: 方法分为离线源组件分解和在线混合权重适应两部分，分别通过EM算法和在线凸优化实现。

Result: 在多个真实回归数据集上，该方法将累积测试损失降低了高达67.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法充分利用偏移特性，实现了优于现有方法的适应性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

TL;DR: SynBrain是一个生成框架，通过概率建模模拟视觉语义到神经响应的转换，解决了现有确定性方法无法同时建模生物变异性和功能一致性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉刺激到神经响应的映射是一对多的关系，现有方法难以同时捕捉生物变异性和功能一致性。

Method: SynBrain包含BrainVAE（通过概率分布建模神经表征）和语义到神经映射器（将视觉语义投影到神经响应流形）。

Result: SynBrain在视觉到fMRI编码性能上优于现有方法，适应新被试能力强，并能生成高质量fMRI信号。

Conclusion: SynBrain不仅提升了性能，还揭示了跨试验和被试的功能一致性，代码将开源。

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

Result: 在皮肤病学、胸部X光和视网膜OCT三个基准数据集上，FedKEI在适应新疾病方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedKEI通过知识增强的初始化，显著提升了联邦学习在医疗领域的适应性和效率。

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习中的后门防御方法依赖于同质数据分布或干净服务器数据集的假设，限制了实用性和有效性。异构数据分布下的防御仍具挑战性。

Method: CLIP-Fed结合预聚合和后聚合防御策略，利用多模态大语言模型和频率分析构建增强的服务器数据集，通过原型对比损失和KL散度对齐全局模型与CLIP的知识。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-10-LT数据集上，CLIP-Fed平均降低ASR 2.03%和1.35%，同时提高MA 7.92%和0.48%。

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed在异构数据分布下有效防御后门攻击，同时提升模型性能。

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统公平聚类方法可能产生不理想的结果，因此作者提出福利中心化的聚类方法，以更好地反映群体效用。

Method: 基于距离和比例代表建模群体效用，提出Rawlsian和Utilitarian两种优化目标，并设计新算法。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，新方法显著优于现有公平聚类基线。

Conclusion: 福利中心化的聚类方法能更有效地实现公平聚类目标。

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

Motivation: IoMT设备易受网络攻击，传统集中式IDS因延迟和隐私问题不适用，而本地运行IDS又受限于设备资源。

Conclusion: 该框架在IoMT环境中具有强适用性，能有效应对零日攻击和已知威胁。

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

Motivation: Mamba模型在序列数据处理中表现出色，但缺乏针对边缘设备的硬件加速框架，eMamba旨在填补这一空白。

Method: eMamba通过简化归一化层、近似昂贵操作（如SiLU激活和指数运算），并结合近似感知的神经架构搜索（NAS）优化参数。

Result: 在多个数据集上，eMamba实现了与现有技术相当的准确性，同时参数更少，并在FPGA和ASIC上表现出更低的延迟、更高的吞吐量和更低的能耗。

Conclusion: eMamba为Mamba模型在边缘设备上的高效部署提供了可行的解决方案，显著提升了性能和资源效率。

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Motivation: 现有ITL方法缺乏评估其是否真正捕捉个体标注者行为模式的框架，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出两种新指标：DIC用于量化模型捕捉标注者倾向的能力，BAE评估模型解释与标注者行为的对齐程度。

Result: 实验验证了所提评估框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为ITL方法的评估提供了标准化工具，有助于理解标注者行为。

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

TL;DR: XQuant通过低比特量化和动态重构KV缓存，显著减少LLM推理的内存消耗，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理面临内存和带宽瓶颈，而计算能力持续增长，需要新算法以计算换内存效率。

Method: 量化并缓存层输入激活X，动态重构KV，利用跨层相似性进一步压缩（XQuant-CL）。

Result: XQuant实现7.7倍内存节省，XQuant-CL达12.5倍，精度损失极小（<0.1困惑度）。

Conclusion: XQuant利用硬件计算能力突破内存瓶颈，优于现有KV缓存量化方法，接近FP16精度。

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also

TL;DR: RealAC是一个领域无关的框架，用于生成现实且可操作的反事实解释，通过自动保持特征间的复杂依赖关系并支持用户自定义约束，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法通常依赖手工约束或领域知识，难以捕捉数据的复杂非线性关系，且缺乏用户自定义灵活性。

Method: RealAC通过对齐事实与反事实实例的特征联合分布来保持依赖关系，并允许用户冻结不希望更改的特征。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，RealAC在因果性、依赖保持和现实性指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RealAC提供了一种因果感知且用户中心的反事实生成解决方案。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

TL;DR: X-Node是一种自解释的图神经网络框架，通过为每个节点生成解释向量，结合上下文和自然语言解释，提高了GNN的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN解释方法多为后处理且全局性，无法提供节点级别的解释，限制了在高风险临床应用中的可信度。

Method: X-Node为每个节点构建结构化上下文向量，通过轻量级Reasoner模块生成解释向量，用于重建嵌入、生成自然语言解释并反馈到消息传递中。

Result: 在MedMNIST和MorphoMNIST数据集上，X-Node在保持分类准确性的同时，提供了忠实且节点级别的解释。

Conclusion: X-Node通过自解释机制提升了GNN的可解释性，适用于需要高透明度的应用场景。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

*Xinrui Li,Qilin Fan,Tianfu Wang,Kaiwen Wei,Ke Yu,Xu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphFedMIG是一种联邦图学习框架，通过生成对抗网络和数据增强解决类别不平衡问题，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦图学习中非独立同分布数据和类别不平衡问题严重影响模型性能，尤其是少数类别的识别能力。

Method: 采用分层生成对抗网络，客户端训练本地生成器合成特征表示，并通过互信息引导机制优化生成器参数。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，GraphFedMIG优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG有效解决了联邦图学习中的类别不平衡问题，提升了模型对少数类别的识别能力。

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

TL;DR: EDAPT框架通过持续模型适应消除脑机接口（BCI）的校准需求，结合群体预训练和在线微调，显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑机接口因神经信号漂移和用户间差异导致精度下降，频繁校准限制了实际应用。

Method: EDAPT先通过多用户数据训练基线解码器，再通过监督微调持续个性化模型。

Result: 在三个BCI任务的九个数据集中，EDAPT始终优于静态方法，更新速度快（200毫秒内）。

Conclusion: EDAPT为无校准BCI提供了实用路径，减少了部署障碍。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of
convex constraints. Our approach, $\Pi$net, leverages operator splitting for
rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design
optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain
modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single
problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems. We surpass
state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution
quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar
inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with
non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package
implemented in JAX with effective tuning heuristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于重构的方法能力有限，而JEPAs显示出更强的潜力，因此需要更高效的方法来构建世界模型。

Method: 整合序列嵌入与神经ODE，通过损失函数强制收缩嵌入和Lipschitz常数，构建有序的潜在状态空间。

Result: 在简单摆系统上仅使用图像数据成功生成了结构化的潜在状态空间模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发更通用的控制算法和估计技术提供了新途径，尤其在机器人领域有广泛应用。

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLU网络的梯度解释通常噪声大且难以解释，现有方法（如GradCAM）通过生成代理模型平滑解释，但牺牲了忠实性。

Method: 引入光谱框架，系统分析解释的平滑性和忠实性，量化ReLU网络对高频信息的贡献，并通过正则化识别权衡。

Result: 分析表明代理平滑会扭曲解释，导致“解释差距”，并验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为解释的平滑性和忠实性提供了理论基础，并量化了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four

TL;DR: MAGUS是一个模块化框架，通过解耦的认知和决策阶段统一多模态理解与生成，支持灵活的扩展性和多模态转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在整合自回归语言模型和扩散模型时的灵活性和可扩展性问题。

Method: 采用两阶段（认知和决策）和多智能体协作，结合LLM推理和扩散生成。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，甚至超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: MAGUS展示了无需联合训练即可实现高效多模态理解和生成的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

<details>

Motivation: 传统MCMC方法在解决组合优化问题时，特别是在计算相变附近的最难基准测试中表现不佳，无法有效处理刚性变量或逃离次优吸引盆地。

Method: 利用深度强化学习训练NMC的非局部转移策略，仅通过观察能量变化和局部最小能量景观几何来优化探索过程。

Result: 在硬均匀随机和尺度自由随机4-SAT基准测试中，该方法在剩余能量、解决时间和解多样性方面优于标准MCMC和非局部模拟退火。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习可以显著提升NMC算法的性能，为组合优化问题提供更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

Motivation: 解决从多个预训练扩散模型中生成联合相关样本并同时满足约束条件的挑战，避免昂贵的重新训练。

Method: 引入耦合引导项和投影步骤，以协调扩散模型并强制执行硬约束。

Result: 在图像对生成、对象操作和多机器人运动规划等应用中表现出改进的耦合效果和约束满足。

Conclusion: PCD框架在无需高计算成本的情况下，有效实现了联合生成和约束满足。

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对软件工程任务的强化学习框架（SWE-oriented RL Framework），并引入Gated Reward Accumulation（G-RA）方法，通过累积即时奖励来优化长期目标，显著提高了任务完成率和修改率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长期强化学习中奖励稀疏和即时奖励与长期目标不一致的问题，特别是在软件工程任务中。

Method: 提出SWE-oriented RL Framework支持多轮交互和Docker执行，并设计G-RA方法，仅在高层次奖励达到阈值时累积即时奖励。

Result: 实验显示G-RA显著提高了任务完成率（47.6%→93.8%和22.0%→86.0%）和修改率（19.6%→23.8%和12.0%→42.0%）。

Conclusion: G-RA方法有效平衡了奖励累积，解决了长期强化学习中的奖励对齐问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet
complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy.
While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced
powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need
for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model
selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system
that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide
users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B
assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and
LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset
characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a
suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By
combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B
lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a
new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

Conclusion: 统一学习方法通过图表示和uGNN优化，有效提升了异构模型的泛化能力，尤其在医学影像领域具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，FreeGAD表现出优异的异常检测性能、效率和扩展性。

Conclusion: FreeGAD无需训练即可高效检测异常，为图异常检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware
representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal
and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is a collaborative learning approach that improves
privacy by keeping data on the client-side while sharing only the intermediate
output with a server. However, the distributed nature of SL introduces new
security challenges, necessitating a comprehensive exploration of potential
attacks. This paper systematically reviews various attacks on SL, classifying
them based on factors such as the attacker's role, the type of privacy risks,
when data leaks occur, and where vulnerabilities exist. We also analyze
existing defense methods, including cryptographic methods, data modification
approaches, distributed techniques, and hybrid solutions. Our findings reveal
security gaps, highlighting the effectiveness and limitations of existing
defenses. By identifying open challenges and future directions, this work
provides valuable information to improve SL privacy issues and guide further
research.

Conclusion: IRT为数据集划分提供了新视角，能显著提升模型验证的稳健性和性能。

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization
against SARS-CoV-2.

Result: MCIB在不依赖捷径学习的情况下取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: 改进模态融合策略和消除捷径信号对提升多模态讽刺检测性能至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

TL;DR: SPHENIC是一种新的空间转录组聚类方法，通过结合拓扑特征和空间邻域信息，解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在空间转录组聚类中存在两个主要问题：拓扑学习对噪声敏感，以及空间邻域信息建模不足。

Method: SPHENIC通过引入不变拓扑特征和设计空间约束与分布优化模块（SCDOM），实现稳定的表示学习和高质量空间嵌入。

Result: 在14个基准数据集上，SPHENIC比现有最佳方法性能提升3.31%-6.54%。

Conclusion: SPHENIC通过整合拓扑和空间信息，显著提升了空间转录组聚类的效果。

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用生成式AI（GenAI）预测土地覆盖变化的新方法，通过将LULC预测视为数据合成问题，并基于历史和辅助数据进行建模。实验表明，该方法在预测不透水表面变化方面优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土地覆盖变化对地球系统过程有重要影响，但目前LULC预测能力滞后于其他领域（如水文和大气预测）。生成式AI为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 将LULC预测建模为数据合成问题，使用扩散模型进行十年尺度的不透水表面预测，并与无变化基线模型对比。

Result: 在12个大都市区的实验中，模型在分辨率≥0.7×0.7km²时，MAE低于基线，表明其能捕捉历史数据中的时空模式。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在LULC预测中具有潜力，未来研究将结合地球物理属性和驱动变量以支持多情景模拟。

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph neural

TL;DR: REFN利用强化学习训练大型语言模型，自动生成网络过滤器，以应对1天或N天漏洞威胁，解决了现有防御措施的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御措施（如主机补丁和网络过滤）在可扩展性、兼容性和部署过程中存在问题，无法有效应对大规模漏洞威胁。

Method: REFN通过强化学习（基于网络奖励而非人工反馈）训练LLM，结合知识蒸馏和在线验证，生成兼容且稳健的网络过滤器。

Result: 在22类漏洞测试中，REFN表现优异（准确率提高21.1%，平均补丁时间3.65小时），并具备高扩展性（支持10K设备）。

Conclusion: REFN为利用LLM快速防御大规模漏洞威胁提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the
Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22
families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1
percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of
3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an
initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n
day exploitations.

Motivation: 解决机器学习在电磁仿真中数据需求大、计算复杂的问题。

Method: 利用GPU加速开源电磁仿真软件（gprMax），生成大量天线仿真数据集，并比较不同机器学习模型的性能。

Result: GPU显著提升计算性能，开源软件在足够精细的分辨率下可与商业软件媲美。

Conclusion: GPU和开源软件结合为天线设计和优化提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics
processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

Conclusion: APFL通过双流设计实现了异质性不变性，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge
to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

Method: 使用Pass@k作为奖励训练策略模型（Pass@k Training），分析其优势并提出高效实现方法。

Result: Pass@k Training提升了探索能力，探索与利用可以相互促进，且优势函数设计显示出潜力。

Conclusion: Pass@k Training为RLVR提供了一种有效方法，优势函数设计是未来研究方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

Conclusion: IBEX显著提高了药物设计的性能，减少了外推误差，并在有效性和多样性方面达到最优。

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种交互式验证范式，解决数据归因方法中的信任问题，确保资源受限方可以验证计算密集型方提供的数据归因的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据归因方法的计算成本高，导致资源受限方难以验证其准确性，引发信任问题。

Method: 设计了一种交互式验证协议，由计算能力强的Prover提供数据归因，资源受限的Verifier通过交互验证其准确性，协议具有PAC验证的完备性、可靠性和效率保证。

Result: 协议确保Verifier接受的归因与最优归因的均方误差在ε范围内，概率为1-δ，且Verifier的计算负担与数据集大小无关。

Conclusion: 该协议为数据归因任务提供了一种高效且可信的验证方法，适用于广泛的归因任务。

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset
size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any
linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them
broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个名为\ourdataset的数据集，用于解决AI驱动药物设计中缺乏实验先验知识的问题，通过LLM管道提取文献中的先验信息，并在多个任务中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的药物设计缺乏实验先验知识，可能导致设计出的分子违反隐含约束（如高诱变性）。为了解决这一问题，作者构建了一个包含文献中化合物先验知识的数据集。

Method: 使用LLM管道从文献中提取自然语言事实和实体表示（如SMILES或refseq ID），构建了包含32.3百万对数据的数据集。随后训练LLM、CLIP和LLava架构，联合推理文本和设计目标。

Result: 在Therapeutic Data Commons（TDC）任务中，使用该数据集预训练的模型（15M参数）性能优于更大的2B TxGemma模型，并与9B模型相当。在GuacaMol优化中，使用该数据集的模型能生成更安全且有效的分子。

Conclusion: \ourdataset数据集能有效提升AI驱动药物设计的先验知识，减少设计风险，并已在多个任务中验证其有效性。数据集已公开，并将随文献增长更新。

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},
and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: PPI框架扩展至处理信息性标注，通过IPW调整偏差校正项，保持有效推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决部分标注数据中标注概率不均的问题，结合预测辅助推断与设计调查抽样思想。

Method: 使用逆概率加权（IPW）替换PPI的无加权偏差校正项，基于Horvitz-Thompson或Hájek形式。

Result: 模拟显示IPW调整的PPI在估计倾向时性能接近已知概率情况，保持覆盖率和方差减少优势。

Conclusion: IPW调整的PPI在信息性标注场景下有效，为预测辅助推断提供新思路。

Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) is a recent framework for valid
statistical inference with partially labeled data, combining model-based
predictions on a large unlabeled set with bias correction from a smaller
labeled subset. We show that PPI can be extended to handle informative labeling
by replacing its unweighted bias-correction term with an inverse probability
weighted (IPW) version, using the classical Horvitz--Thompson or H\'ajek forms.
This connection unites design-based survey sampling ideas with modern
prediction-assisted inference, yielding estimators that remain valid when
labeling probabilities vary across units. We consider the common setting where
the inclusion probabilities are not known but estimated from a correctly
specified model. In simulations, the performance of IPW-adjusted PPI with
estimated propensities closely matches the known-probability case, retaining
both nominal coverage and the variance-reduction benefits of PPI.

TL;DR: 论文将批量遗忘场景扩展到在线设置，通过改进算法实现对数级遗憾界限，并优化内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习管道需要持续学习和遗忘，但现有方法假设静态环境，不适用于实际生产数据流。

Method: 使用遗憾、样本复杂性和删除能力概念，将批量遗忘扩展到在线设置，并采用在线L-BFGS优化替代昂贵的Hessian逆运算。

Result: 实现了对数级遗憾界限（O(ln T)），并显著减少了内存占用。

Conclusion: 改进的算法延长了模型寿命，使遗忘过程更高效。

Abstract: Machine unlearning work assumes a static, i.i.d training environment that
doesn't truly exist. Modern ML pipelines need to learn, unlearn, and predict
continuously on production streams of data. We translate the notion of the
batch unlearning scenario to the online setting using notions of regret, sample
complexity, and deletion capacity. We further tighten regret bounds to a
logarithmic $\mathcal{O}(\ln{T})$, a first for a machine unlearning algorithm.
And we swap out an expensive Hessian inversion with online variant of L-BFGS
optimization, removing a memory footprint that scales linearly with time. Such
changes extend the lifespan of an ML model before expensive retraining, making
for a more efficient unlearning process.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文为非渐近性广义一阶迭代算法（包括梯度优化和近似消息传递）在有限样本下的行为建立了界限，通过构造显式耦合和条件高斯过程，提供了紧致的维度无关界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究广义一阶迭代算法在有限样本下的行为，特别是在高斯数据矩阵和非可分非线性条件下的表现，以填补传统AMP理论在非渐近分析中的不足。

Method: 通过构造显式耦合和条件高斯过程，利用有限维状态演化递归确定协方差演化，直接比较广义一阶方法和条件高斯过程。

Result: 在温和的Lipschitz和矩匹配条件下，获得了紧致的维度无关界限，并通过Wasserstein距离的下界验证了上界的锐度。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种不依赖可分性或渐近性的统一AMP理论推导方法，为非渐近分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: We establish non-asymptotic bounds on the finite-sample behavior of
generalized first-order iterative algorithms -- including gradient-based
optimization methods and approximate message passing (AMP) -- with Gaussian
data matrices and full-memory, non-separable nonlinearities. The central result
constructs an explicit coupling between the iterates of a generalized
first-order method and a conditionally Gaussian process whose covariance
evolves deterministically via a finite-dimensional state evolution recursion.
This coupling yields tight, dimension-free bounds under mild Lipschitz and
moment-matching conditions. Our analysis departs from classical inductive AMP
proofs by employing a direct comparison between the generalized first-order
method and the conditionally Gaussian comparison process. This approach
provides a unified derivation of AMP theory for Gaussian matrices without
relying on separability or asymptotics. A complementary lower bound on the
Wasserstein distance demonstrates the sharpness of our upper bounds.

*Johanna Düngler,Amartya Sanyal*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种差分隐私随机PCA算法，能够高效估计前k个特征向量，克服了现有方法的样本量需求高或噪声过多的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私PCA方法要么需要样本量与维度超线性关系，要么引入过多噪声，限制了实际应用。本文旨在解决这些问题，支持任意k≤d的情况。

Method: 提出了一种新算法，能够在差分隐私条件下估计前k个特征向量，适用于任意k≤d，并在样本量n=Õ(d)时达到接近最优的统计误差。

Result: 对于k=1，算法与DP-PCA性能相当；对于k>1，提供了上下界匹配的理论保证，并通过实验验证了算法的优势。

Conclusion: 该算法首次实现了在差分隐私条件下高效估计任意k个特征向量，填补了现有方法的不足，具有理论和实际意义。

Abstract: Given $n$ i.i.d. random matrices $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ that share
a common expectation $\Sigma$, the objective of Differentially Private
Stochastic PCA is to identify a subspace of dimension $k$ that captures the
largest variance directions of $\Sigma$, while preserving differential privacy
(DP) of each individual $A_i$. Existing methods either (i) require the sample
size $n$ to scale super-linearly with dimension $d$, even under Gaussian
assumptions on the $A_i$, or (ii) introduce excessive noise for DP even when
the intrinsic randomness within $A_i$ is small. Liu et al. (2022a) addressed
these issues for sub-Gaussian data but only for estimating the top eigenvector
($k=1$) using their algorithm DP-PCA. We propose the first algorithm capable of
estimating the top $k$ eigenvectors for arbitrary $k \leq d$, whilst overcoming
both limitations above. For $k=1$ our algorithm matches the utility guarantees
of DP-PCA, achieving near-optimal statistical error even when $n =
\tilde{\!O}(d)$. We further provide a lower bound for general $k > 1$, matching
our upper bound up to a factor of $k$, and experimentally demonstrate the
advantages of our algorithm over comparable baselines.

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) variant of optimal transport, designed to compare
probability densities defined over distinct metric spaces, has emerged as an
important tool for the analysis of data with complex structure, such as
ensembles of point clouds or networks. To overcome certain limitations, such as
the restriction to comparisons of measures of equal mass and sensitivity to
outliers, several unbalanced or partial transport relaxations of the GW
distance have been introduced in the recent literature. This paper is concerned
with the Conic Gromov-Wasserstein (CGW) distance introduced by
S\'{e}journ\'{e}, Vialard, and Peyr\'{e}. We provide a novel formulation in
terms of semi-couplings, and extend the framework beyond the metric measure
space setting, to compare more general network and hypernetwork structures.
With this new formulation, we establish several fundamental properties of the
CGW metric, including its scaling behavior under dilation, variational
convergence in the limit of volume growth constraints, and comparison bounds
with established optimal transport metrics. We further derive quantitative
bounds that characterize the robustness of the CGW metric to perturbations in
the underlying measures. The hypernetwork formulation of CGW admits a simple
and provably convergent block coordinate ascent algorithm for its estimation,
and we demonstrate the computational tractability and scalability of our
approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world high-dimensional and
structured datasets.
