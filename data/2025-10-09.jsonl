In addition to truthfulness, we mathematically prove and\nempirically verify that our calibration measure exhibits superior robustness:\nit robustly preserves the ordering between dominant and dominated predictors,\nregardless of the choice of hyperparameters (bin sizes). This result addresses\nthe non-robustness issue of binned ECE, which has been observed repeatedly in\nprior work."}

We address this gap by systematically\ncomparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a\ncomputationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this\nanalysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations\nfollows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters,\nakin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the\nunderparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more\ninformative than those learned with clean labels, while in the\noverparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative.

While many studies have demonstrated\nperformance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing\nstrategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to\ndynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations\nthat rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.\nDue to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving\naverages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing\ncircumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that\nuses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at\neach epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning\nhigher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We\nshow that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning\nnetwork, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the\naccuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that\npredict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret\nz-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than\nmodels predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network\ninference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series\nof optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model\ncan be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.\nThese properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each\ndomain.

Extracting\nthese internal models through access to a DNN is conceptually similar to\nextracting a secret key via oracle access to a block cipher.

While early works (e.g., Crypto 2020, Eurocrypt 2024)\nassume access to exact output logits, which are usually invisible, more recent\nworks (e.g., Asiacrypt 2024, Eurocrypt 2025) focus on the hard-label setting,\nwhere only the final classification result (e.g., \"dog\" or \"car\") is available\nto the attacker.

In practice,\nsatisfying these assumptions requires an exponential number of queries with\nrespect to the attack depth, implying that the attack does not always run in\npolynomial time. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel attack\nmethod called CrossLayer Extraction. Instead of directly extracting the secret\nparameters (e.g., weights and biases) of a specific neuron, which incurs\nexponential cost, we exploit neuron interactions across layers to extract this\ninformation from deeper layers. This technique significantly reduces query\ncomplexity and mitigates the limitations of existing model extraction\napproaches."}

The\ninformativeness of conformal prediction depends on its efficiency, typically\nquantified by the expected size of the prediction set. Prior work on the\nefficiency of conformalized regression commonly treats the miscoverage level\n$\\alpha$ as a fixed constant. In this work, we establish non-asymptotic bounds\non the deviation of the prediction set length from the oracle interval length\nfor conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD, under mild\nassumptions on the data distribution. Our bounds of order\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{n} + 1/(\\alpha^2 n) + 1/\\sqrt{m} + \\exp(-\\alpha^2 m))$\ncapture the joint dependence of efficiency on the proper training set size $n$,\nthe calibration set size $m$, and the miscoverage level $\\alpha$. The results\nidentify phase transitions in convergence rates across different regimes of\n$\\alpha$, offering guidance for allocating data to control excess prediction\nset length. Empirical results are consistent with our theoretical findings."}

In this paper we show that the core insight to address this\nquestion stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization\nalgorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer\nto as \"faithful\" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the\nfinite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary\ncounterpart which \"closely resembles\" the original objective (in contrast, the\nclassical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins\nindex, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner).

In this work, we\nprovide a rigorous analysis of the singular value spectrum of the attention\nmatrix and establish the first Gaussian equivalence result for attention. In a\nnatural regime where the inverse temperature remains of constant order, we show\nthat the singular value distribution of the attention matrix is asymptotically\ncharacterized by a tractable linear model. We further demonstrate that the\ndistribution of squared singular values deviates from the Marchenko-Pastur law,\nwhich has been believed in previous work. Our proof relies on two key\ningredients: precise control of fluctuations in the normalization term and a\nrefined linearization that leverages favorable Taylor expansions of the\nexponential. This analysis also identifies a threshold for linearization and\nelucidates why attention, despite not being an entrywise operation, admits a\nrigorous Gaussian equivalence in this regime."}

However,\nthe sequential decisions made by an RL algorithm, while optimized to maximize\noverall population benefits, may disadvantage certain individuals who are in\nminority or socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. To address this problem, we\nintroduce PyCFRL, a Python library for ensuring counterfactual fairness in\noffline RL. PyCFRL implements a novel data preprocessing algorithm for learning\ncounterfactually fair RL policies from offline datasets and provides tools to\nevaluate the values and counterfactual unfairness levels of RL policies. We\ndescribe the high-level functionalities of PyCFRL and demonstrate one of its\nmajor use cases through a data example.

Arising from the uncertainty quantification community,\nrecent results have demonstrated the existence and uniqueness of a generalized\nHoeffding decomposition for such predictive models when the stochastic input\nvariables are correlated, based on concepts of oblique projection onto L 2\nsubspaces. This article focuses on the case where the input variables have\nBernoulli distributions and provides a complete description of this\ndecomposition. We show that in this case the underlying L 2 subspaces are\none-dimensional and that the functional decomposition is explicit. This leads\nto a complete interpretability framework and theoretically allows reverse\nengineering. Explicit indicators of the influence of inputs on the output\nprediction (exemplified by Sobol' indices and Shapley effects) can be\nexplicitly derived.

Existing methods provide remarkably strong\nperformance guarantees with minimal computational costs. However, they require\nto use calibration samples composed by labeled examples different to those used\nfor training. This requirement can be highly inconvenient, as it prevents the\nuse of all labeled examples for training and may require acquiring additional\nlabels solely for calibration. This paper presents an effective methodology for\nsplit conformal prediction with unsupervised calibration for classification\ntasks. In the proposed approach, set-prediction rules are obtained using\nunsupervised calibration samples together with supervised training samples\npreviously used to learn the classification rule. Theoretical and experimental\nresults show that the presented methods can achieve performance comparable to\nthat with supervised calibration, at the expenses of a moderate degradation in\nperformance guarantees and computational efficiency."}
