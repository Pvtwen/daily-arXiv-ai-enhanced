### [1] [Sub- μ W Battery-Less and Oscillator-Less Wi-Fi Backscattering Transmitter Reusing RF Signal for Harvesting, Communications, and Motion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05479)
*Marco Privitera,Andrea Ballo,Karim Ali Ahmed,Alfio Dario Grasso,Massimo Alioto*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种亚微瓦级功耗的802.11b反向散射发射器，实现了射频能量收集、反向散射通信和位置/运动传感的多功能复用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过消除电池和外部运动传感器（如MEMS），实现设备的超小型化、无限制寿命以及低成本制造和维护。

Method: 采用双音入射波的二阶互调提取频率，消除本地振荡器，突破WiFi发射器的微瓦功耗限制。

Result: 实现了最低至-19 dBm的累积能量收集/传输/传感灵敏度，并通过收集电压作为接收信号强度（RSS）的代理实现位置/运动传感。

Conclusion: 该技术首次突破了WiFi发射器的微瓦功耗墙，为室内环境中的标签提供了多功能、低成本且持久的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, a sub-uW power 802.11b backscattering transmitter is presented
to enable reuse of the same incident wave for three purposes: RF harvesting,
backscattering communications and position/motion sensing. The removal of the
battery and any off-chip motion sensor (e.g., MEMS) enables unprecedented level
of miniaturization and ubiquity, unrestricted device lifespan, low fabrication
and maintenance cost. The uW power wall for WiFi transmitters is broken for the
first time via local oscillator elimination, as achieved by extracting its
frequency through second-order intermodulation of a twotone incident wave. The
two-tone scheme also enables a cumulative harvesting/transmission/sensing
sensitivity down to Pmin -19 dBm. Position/motion sensing is enabled by using
the harvested voltage as a proxy for the Received Signal Strength (RSS),
allowing to sense the chip location with respect to the tone generator(s)
shared across tags in indoor neighborhoods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统雷达专用硬件实现实时信号处理存在波形灵活性不足和系统复杂度高的问题，现代通用计算系统为实时数字信号处理提供了新可能。

Abstract: General requirements for radar digital signal processing are ionospheric
distortion and Doppler dispersion correction, which has historically required
radar-specific hardware to implement in real time. Although analog solutions
are computationally efficient, they often come with system design drawbacks
which limit waveform flexibility and can result in an overall increase of
system complexity. With improvements in modern general compute systems,
real-time digital signal processing is becoming more realizable using
non-radar-specific high-performance compute. In this paper, we present an
analysis of general Doppler and ionospheric correction algorithms for arbitrary
waveforms for radar digital signal processing. We also include considerations
for efficient implementation of these algorithms in software, specifically
using GPU hardware. This analysis includes metrics of performance such as
execution time and error correction accuracy. We also provide recommendations
for application in radar signal processing. We identify two algorithms for
dispersion correction: an FFT-based method for ionospheric dispersion and a
numerical interpolation method via sinc interpolation for Doppler dispersion.
Both of these algorithms are able to compensate for dispersion equivalent in
accuracy to waveform-specific analytical methods and were able to be performed
in real-time on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. These methods are waveform agnostic
and applied directly to the samples, improving system flexibility and making
them easy to incorporate into existing software-defined radio systems.

### [3] [Anti-Jamming Sensing with Distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04964)
*Zhaowei Wang,Yunsong Huang,Weicheng Liu,Hui-Ming Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用分布式可重构智能超表面天线（RIMSA）和深度强化学习（DRL）优化无线传感性能的方法，有效应对信号干扰和环境噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统射频（RF）传感方法因传播信道的不利影响（如衰落和噪声）导致精度受限，亟需一种新方法提升传感性能。

Method: 部署多个RIMSA接收器，通过编程其波束成形模式增强信号质量，并采用DRL算法优化波束成形和信号映射。

Result: 仿真显示，分布式RIMSA系统比集中式实现更高效，且能在干扰环境下保持高精度传感。

Conclusion: 分布式RIMSA结合DRL和神经网络，显著提升了无线传感的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: The utilization of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless sensing has
garnered increasing attention. However, the radio environment is unpredictable
and often unfavorable, the sensing accuracy of traditional RF sensing methods
is often affected by adverse propagation channels from the transmitter to the
receiver, such as fading and noise. In this paper, we propose employing
distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) to detect
the presence and location of objects where multiple RIMSA receivers (RIMSA Rxs)
are deployed on different places. By programming their beamforming patterns,
RIMSA Rxs can enhance the quality of received signals. The RF sensing problem
is modeled as a joint optimization problem of beamforming pattern and mapping
of received signals to sensing outcomes. To address this challenge, we
introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm aimed at calculating
the optimal beamforming patterns and a neural network aimed at converting
received signals into sensing outcomes. In addition, the malicious attacker may
potentially launch jamming attack to disrupt sensing process. To enable
effective sensing in interferenceprone environment, we devise a combined loss
function that takes into account the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio
(SINR) of the received signals. The simulation results show that the proposed
distributed RIMSA system can achieve more efficient sensing performance and
better overcome environmental influences than centralized implementation.
Furthermore, the introduced method ensures high-accuracy sensing performance
even under jamming attack.

### [4] [Localized Kernel Methods for Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04978)
*Sippanon Kitimoon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种基于局部核的信号处理方法，用于噪声条件下的参数恢复，分别针对多维指数模型和线性啁啾信号分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在低信噪比条件下参数恢复的挑战，特别是在多维指数模型和复杂啁啾信号分离中。

Method: 1. 使用局部三角多项式核检测多维频率，并通过坐标投影和配准提高恢复精度；2. 基于局部核的SSO变体，通过FFT滤波和分段线性回归分离啁啾信号。

Result: 在低信噪比下优于经典算法（如MUSIC和ESPRIT），并能恢复低至-30 dB的交叉和不连续啁啾信号。

Conclusion: 基于局部核的方法在噪声条件下表现出鲁棒性和高效性，未来可扩展至非线性啁啾和自适应核设计。

Abstract: This dissertation presents two signal processing methods using specially
designed localized kernels for parameter recovery under noisy condition. The
first method addresses the estimation of frequencies and amplitudes in
multidimensional exponential models. It utilizes localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels to detect the multivariate frequencies, followed by a more
detailed parameter estimation. We compare our method with MUSIC and ESPRIT,
which are classical subspace-based algorithms widely used for estimating the
parameters of exponential signals. In the univariate case, the method
outperforms MUSIC and ESPRIT under low signal-to-noise ratios. For the
multivariate case, we develop a coordinate-wise projection and registration
approach that achieves high recovery accuracy using significantly fewer samples
than other methods.
  The second method focuses on separating linear chirp components from
time-localized signal segments. A variant of the Signal Separation Operator
(SSO) is constructed using a localized kernel. Instantaneous frequency
estimates are obtained via FFT-based filtering, then clustered and fitted with
piecewise linear regression. The method operates without prior knowledge of the
number of components and is shown to recover intersecting and discontinuous
chirps at SNR levels as low as -30 dB.
  Both methods share an idea based on localized kernels and efficient FFT-based
implementation, and neither requires subspace decomposition or sparsity
regularization. Experimental results confirm the robustness and tractability of
the proposed approaches across a range of simulated data conditions. Potential
extensions include application to nonlinear chirps, adaptive kernel design, and
signal classification using extracted features.

### [5] [Power-Constrained and Quantized MIMO-RSMA Systems with Imperfect CSIT: Joint Precoding, Antenna Selection, and Power Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05080)
*Jiwon Sung,Seokjun Park,Jinseok Choi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合预编码、天线选择和发射功率控制算法，以最大化基站功率预算下的总频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 充分利用基站的可用功率潜力，解决多用户MIMO系统中频谱效率最大化问题。

Method: 通过条件平均速率方法处理不完美CSIT，并分解问题为预编码方向和功率控制子问题，分别用拉格朗日驻点和梯度下降求解。

Result: 仿真验证了算法有效性，并发现8-11位中等分辨率DAC比低分辨率DAC更高效。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在功率预算下优化性能，中等分辨率DAC更具优势。

Abstract: To utilize the full potential of the available power at a base station (BS),
we propose a joint precoding, antenna selection, and transmit power control
algorithm for a total power budget at the BS. We formulate a sum spectral
efficiency (SE) maximization problem for downlink multi-user multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) systems with
arbitrary-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs). We reformulate the
problem by defining the ergodic sum SE using the conditional average rate
approach to handle imperfect channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT), and by using approximation techniques to make the problem more
tractable. Then, we decompose the problem into precoding direction and power
control subproblems. We solve the precoding direction subproblem by identifying
a superior Lagrangian stationary point, and the power control subproblem using
gradient descent. We also propose a complexity-reduction approach that is more
suitable for massive MIMO systems. Simulation results not only validate the
proposed algorithm but also reveal that when utilizing the full potential of
the power budget at the BS, medium-resolution DACs with 8-11 bits may actually
be more power-efficient than low-resolution DACs.

### [6] [Digital Twin Channel-Aided CSI Prediction: A Environment-based Subspace Extraction Approach for Achieving Low Overhead and Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05142)
*Yichen Cai,Jianhua Zhang,Li Yu,Zhen Zhang,Yuxiang Zhang,Lianzheng Shi,Yuelong Qiu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于环境特定信道子空间基（EB）的部分到全信道状态信息（CSI）预测方法（EB-P2WCP），用于实现数字孪生信道（DTC）的低开销信道预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为满足6G移动通信系统在复杂场景下对鲁棒性和高速通信的需求，减少系统开销。

Method: 利用EB表征电磁环境的静态特性，将其与实时估计的局部CSI融合，预测整个空间-频率域信道。设计了EB-P2WNet网络实现鲁棒预测。

Conclusion: EB-P2WCP方法有效降低系统开销，提升信道预测鲁棒性，适用于复杂6G场景。

Abstract: To meet the robust and high-speed communication requirements of the
sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication system in complex scenarios,
sensing- and artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital twin channel (DTC)
techniques become a promising approach to reduce system overhead. In this
paper, we propose an environment-specific channel subspace basis (EB)-aided
partial-to-whole channel state information (CSI) prediction method (EB-P2WCP)
for realizing DTC-enabled low-overhead channel prediction. Specifically, EB is
utilized to characterize the static properties of the electromagnetic
environment, which is extracted from the digital twin map, serving as
environmental information prior to the prediction task. Then, we fuse EB with
real-time estimated local CSI to predict the entire spatial-frequency domain
channel for both the present and future time instances. Hence, an EB-based
partial-to-whole CSI prediction network (EB-P2WNet) is designed to achieve a
robust channel prediction scheme in various complex scenarios. Simulation
results indicate that incorporating EB provides significant benefits under low
signal-to-noise ratio and pilot ratio conditions, achieving a reduction of up
to 50% in pilot overhead. Additionally, the proposed method maintains
robustness against multi-user interference, tolerating 3-meter localization
errors with only a 0.5 dB NMSE increase, and predicts CSI for the next channel
coherent time within 1.3 milliseconds.

### [7] [Optimization of Liquid Lens-based Imaging Receiver for MIMO VLC Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05204)
*Kapila W. S. Palitharathna,Christodoulos Skouroumounis,Ioannis Krikidis*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于液体透镜的成像接收器，用于MIMO可见光通信系统，通过动态调整液体透镜的焦距和方向角，降低MIMO信道增益的空间相关性，从而提升误码率性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态透镜在动态条件下（如用户移动和接收器随机方向）适应性不足，液体透镜的动态调整能力可显著改善系统性能。

Method: 开发了精确的数学模型来描述系统信道增益，并提出了两种透镜调整方案（CLS和VULO）以最小化误码率。

Result: 数值结果表明，在随机接收器方向条件下，液体透镜系统显著优于传统静态透镜系统，误码率从4×10^-2降至5×10^-4。

Conclusion: 液体透镜在动态环境中具有显著优势，可有效提升MIMO可见光通信系统的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, a liquid lens-based imaging receiver is proposed for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC)
systems. By dynamically adjusting the focal length and orientation angles of
the liquid lens, the spatial correlation between MIMO channel gains is reduced,
leading to enhanced bit-error rate (BER) performance. Unlike static lenses,
liquid lenses offer adaptability in dynamic conditions, including user mobility
and random receiver orientation. An accurate mathematical framework is
developed to model the channel gains of the proposed system, and an
optimization problem is formulated to minimize its BER. Due to the complexity
of the resulting channel model, two lens adjustment schemes, namely, ($i$) the
CLS scheme, and ($ii$) the VULO scheme are introduced. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed liquid lens-based system offers substantial BER
improvements over conventional static lens-based receivers across a wide range
of random receiver orientation conditions. Specifically, at a random receiver
orientation variance of $10^{\circ}$, the BER is improved from $4\times
10^{-2}$ to $5\times 10^{-4}$ by employing the proposed liquid lens.

### [8] [Deep Learning Based Dynamic Environment Reconstruction for Vehicular ISAC Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05226)
*Junzhe Song,Ruisi He,Mi Yang,Zhengyu Zhang,Bingcheng Liu,Jiahui Han,Haoxiang Zhang,Bo Ai*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的ISAC框架，用于车辆环境重建，通过多阶段网络实现高质量动态场景重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ISAC方法在动态场景跟踪和时空一致性上表现不足，限制了实际应用。

Method: 建立多模态测量数据集，开发多阶段深度学习网络（场景解码器、聚类中心解码器、点云解码器）进行环境重建。

Result: 实验显示方法在Chamfer Distance（0.29）和F Score@1%（0.87）上表现优异，复杂度分析证实其高效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来智能交通提供了低成本环境重建的可行路径。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) technology plays a critical role
in future intelligent transportation systems, by enabling vehicles to perceive
and reconstruct the surrounding environment through reuse of wireless signals,
thereby reducing or even eliminating the need for additional sensors such as
LiDAR or radar. However, existing ISAC based reconstruction methods often lack
the ability to track dynamic scenes with sufficient accuracy and temporal
consistency, limiting the real world applicability. To address this limitation,
we propose a deep learning based framework for vehicular environment
reconstruction by using ISAC channels. We first establish a joint channel
environment dataset based on multi modal measurements from real world urban
street scenarios. Then, a multistage deep learning network is developed to
reconstruct the environment. Specifically, a scene decoder identifies the
environmental context such as buildings, trees and so on; a cluster center
decoder predicts coarse spatial layouts by localizing dominant scattering
centers; a point cloud decoder recovers fine grained geometry and structure of
surrounding environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves high-quality dynamic environment reconstruction with a Chamfer
Distance of 0.29 and F Score@1% of 0.87. In addition, complexity analysis
demonstrates the efficiency and practical applicability of the method in real
time scenarios. This work provides a pathway toward low cost environment
reconstruction based on ISAC for future intelligent transportation.

### [9] [Unifying Common Signal Analyses with Instantaneous Time-Frequency Atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05380)
*Steven Sandoval,Phillip L. De Leon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于瞬时时间-频率原子的方法，用于计算与多种信号分析相关的瞬时频谱（IS），并通过二次线性调频模板统一了这些分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作提出了瞬时时间-频率分析的通用框架，但未提供具体计算瞬时频谱的细节。本文旨在填补这一空白，并展示如何统一多种信号分析方法。

Method: 使用瞬时时间-频率原子，结合二次线性调频模板，将时间域分析、频率域分析、分数阶傅里叶变换等信号分析方法统一为一个二维连续体。

Result: 开发了对应各种信号分析的瞬时频谱的闭式表达式，并通过示例信号验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过二次线性调频模板，本文成功统一了多种信号分析方法，并提供了计算瞬时频谱的具体方法。

Abstract: In previous work, we presented a general framework for instantaneous
time-frequency analysis but did not provide any specific details of how to
compute a particular instantaneous spectrum (IS). In this work, we use
instantaneous time-frequency atoms to obtain an IS associated with common
signal analyses: time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, fractional
Fourier transform, synchrosqueezed short-time Fourier transform, and
synchrosqueezed short-time fractional Fourier transform. By doing so, we
demonstrate how the general framework can be used to unify these analyses and
we develop closed-form expressions for the corresponding ISs. This is
accomplished by viewing these analyses as decompositions into AM--FM components
and recognizing that each uses a specialized (or limiting) form of a quadratic
chirplet as a template during analysis. With a two-parameter quadratic
chirplet, we can organize these ISs into a 2D continuum with points in the
plane corresponding to a decomposition related to one of the signal analyses.
Finally, using several example signals, we compute in closed-form the ISs for
the various analyses.

Abstract: A four-stage operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) for ultra-low-power
applications is introduced in this paper. The proposed circuit inclusive of
frequency compensation requires minimal transistor count and passives,
overcoming the traditionally difficult compensation of 4-stage OTAs and
bringing it back to the simplicity of 3-stage OTAs. At the same time, the
proposed circuit achieves high power efficiency, as evidenced by the >3.7X
(>11.3X) improvement in the large-signal (small-signal) power efficiency figure
of merit FOML (FOMS), compared to prior 4-stage OTAs (sub-1 V multi-stage
OTAs). Thanks to the lower sensitivity of the phase margin to the load
capacitance, the proposed OTA remains stable under a wide range of loads
(double-sided as in any 3-4-stage OTA), achieving a max/min ratio of the load
capacitance of >100X.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂系统的可靠过程建模具有挑战性，需要一种能够结合数据驱动建模和实时传感器数据校正的方法。

Method: 通过RC学习非线性系统动态，作为UKF预测步骤中的替代模型；UKF测量更新则整合实时传感器数据以校正模型漂移。

Result: 在基准问题和实时车辆轨迹估计任务中验证了RCUKF的有效性。

Conclusion: RCUKF框架在复杂系统中表现出色，尤其在数据驱动模型可能失效的高维或混沌场景中。

Abstract: Accurate modeling is crucial in many engineering and scientific applications,
yet obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is often
challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, reservoir
computing with unscented Kalman filtering (RCUKF), which integrates data-driven
modeling via reservoir computing (RC) with Bayesian estimation through the
unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The RC component learns the nonlinear system
dynamics directly from data, serving as a surrogate process model in the UKF
prediction step to generate state estimates in high-dimensional or chaotic
regimes where nominal mathematical models may fail. Meanwhile, the UKF
measurement update integrates real-time sensor data to correct potential drift
in the data-driven model. We demonstrate RCUKF effectiveness on well-known
benchmark problems and a real-time vehicle trajectory estimation task in a
high-fidelity simulation environment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合深度学习架构，结合LSTM、Transformer、TS-Mixer和注意力机制，显著提升了ROP预测的准确性和实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉钻井数据的复杂动态和高维特性，导致预测效果不佳。

Method: 采用混合深度学习架构，整合LSTM、Transformer、TS-Mixer和注意力机制，建模时间依赖性和特征交互。

Result: 模型在真实数据集上表现优异，R-squared达0.9988，MAPE为1.447%。

Conclusion: 该混合方法为实时ROP预测和智能钻井优化提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations;
however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and
high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based,
and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and
contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited
real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning
architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer
encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to
synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions,
global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world
drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer,
and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute
Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics
(R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and
LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and
fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable
real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective
drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAEx是一个模型无关的框架，用于解释网络对齐模型的决策，通过识别关键子图和特征来提升可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络对齐模型的可解释性有限，难以理解其决策过程，尤其是在高风险领域。

Method: NAEx通过可学习的边和特征掩码联合参数化图结构和特征空间，并引入优化目标确保解释忠实于原始预测。

Result: NAEx在基准数据集上表现出高效性和有效性，并能推广到未见数据。

Conclusion: NAEx提升了网络对齐模型的可解释性，为决策提供了更透明的依据。

Abstract: Network alignment (NA) identifies corresponding nodes across multiple
networks, with applications in domains like social networks, co-authorship, and
biology. Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains
limited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing
challenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address
this, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that
explains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing
predictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint
cross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly
parameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and
feature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures
explanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable
meaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between
networks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA
explanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics
tailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and
efficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA
models.

Conclusion: LumiGen通过LVLM集成显著提升了T2I生成的可控性和质量，验证了LVLM在图像生成中的有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has made significant advancements with
diffusion models, yet challenges persist in handling complex instructions,
ensuring fine-grained content control, and maintaining deep semantic
consistency. Existing T2I models often struggle with tasks like accurate text
rendering, precise pose generation, or intricate compositional coherence.
Concurrently, Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in cross-modal understanding and instruction following. We propose
LumiGen, a novel LVLM-enhanced iterative framework designed to elevate T2I
model performance, particularly in areas requiring fine-grained control,
through a closed-loop, LVLM-driven feedback mechanism. LumiGen comprises an
Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module for proactive prompt
enhancement and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module, which
acts as a "visual critic" to iteratively correct and optimize generated images.
Evaluated on the challenging LongBench-T2I Benchmark, LumiGen achieves a
superior average score of 3.08, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, our framework demonstrates significant improvements in critical
dimensions such as text rendering and pose expression, validating the
effectiveness of LVLM integration for more controllable and higher-quality
image generation.

governed by complex and unobservable missing mechanisms. Simulating missingness
has become a standard approach for understanding its impact on learning and
analysis. However, existing tools are fragmented, mechanism-limited, and
typically focus only on numerical variables, overlooking the heterogeneous
nature of real-world tabular data. We present MissMecha, an open-source Python
toolkit for simulating, visualizing, and evaluating missing data under MCAR,
MAR, and MNAR assumptions. MissMecha supports both numerical and categorical
features, enabling mechanism-aware studies across mixed-type tabular datasets.
It includes visual diagnostics, MCAR testing utilities, and type-aware
imputation evaluation metrics. Designed to support data quality research,
benchmarking, and education,MissMecha offers a unified platform for researchers
and practitioners working with incomplete data.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality
content generation, yet their intensive computational requirements for
inference pose challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Cloud-based
solutions aid in computation but often fall short in addressing privacy risks,
personalization efficiency, and communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we first analyze existing edge-AIGC applications
in personalized content synthesis, revealing their limitations in efficiency
and scalability. We then propose a novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated
aggregation framework. Based on parameter-efficient local fine-tuning via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the framework first clusters clients based on the
similarity of their uploaded task requirements, followed by an intra-cluster
aggregation for enhanced personalization at the server-side. Subsequently, an
inter-cluster knowledge interaction paradigm is implemented to enable
hybrid-style content generation across diverse clusters.Building upon federated
learning (FL) collaboration, our framework simultaneously trains personalized
models for individual users at the devices and a shared global model enhanced
with multiple LoRA adapters on the server,enabling efficient edge inference;
meanwhile, all prompts for clustering and inference are encoded prior to
transmission, thereby further mitigating the risk of plaintext leakage. Our
evaluations demonstrate that the framework achieves accelerated convergence
while maintaining practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC
services under edge constraints.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to
generalize models from a small number of labeled examples, typically fewer than
10 per class. FSL is particularly crucial in biomedical, environmental,
materials, and mechanical sciences, where samples are limited and data
collection is often prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or ethically
constrained. In this study, we present an innovative approach to FSL by
demonstrating that a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM), trained on a set of
independent tasks spanning diverse domains, task types, and input modalities,
can substantially improve the generalization of FSL models, outperforming
models based on conventional meta-learning on tasks of the same type. To
support this, we first constructed a Multi-Modal Model Few-shot Dataset (M3FD,
over 10K+ few-shot samples), which includes 2D RGB images, 2D/3D medical scans,
tabular and time-course datasets, from which we manually curated FSL tasks such
as classification. We further introduced M3F (Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot
learning framework), a novel Large Multi-Modal Model framework tailored for
data-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of
scientific data types through a modular pipeline. By fine-tuning the model on
M3FD, M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL
deployment. The source code is located at https://github.com/ptdang1001/M3F. To
democratize access to complex FSL data and promote reproducibility for public
usage, M3FD is paired with a flexible and user-friendly tool that enables
efficient querying, task-specific sampling, and preprocessing. Together, our
dataset and framework offer a unified, scalable solution that significantly
lowers the barrier to applying LMMMs in data-scarce scientific domains.

Conclusion: GM层为神经网络架构提供了新的可能性，并展示了与传统方法不同的动态行为。

Abstract: The mean-field theory for two-layer neural networks considers infinitely wide
networks that are linearly parameterized by a probability measure over the
parameter space. This nonparametric perspective has significantly advanced both
the theoretical and conceptual understanding of neural networks, with
substantial efforts made to validate its applicability to networks of moderate
width. In this work, we explore the opposite direction, investigating whether
dynamics can be directly implemented over probability measures. Specifically,
we employ Gaussian mixture models as a flexible and expressive parametric
family of distributions together with the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows
to derive training dynamics for such measures. Our approach introduces a new
type of layer -- the Gaussian mixture (GM) layer -- that can be integrated into
neural network architectures. As a proof of concept, we validate our proposal
through experiments on simple classification tasks, where a GM layer achieves
test performance comparable to that of a two-layer fully connected network.
Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these dynamics and demonstrate
numerically that GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to
classical fully connected layers, even when the latter are large enough to be
considered in the mean-field regime.

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol能有效提取相关分子属性，提升预测性能和可解释性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in
https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，多模态时间序列数据（尤其是文本模态）常受干扰，现有方法忽视文本数据的内在扰动，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出PA-RNet，包含扰动感知投影模块和跨模态注意力机制，分离噪声并保持语义表示。

Result: 实验表明PA-RNet在多种领域和时间设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PA-RNet通过理论保证和实验验证，显著提升了多模态时间序列预测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In real-world applications, multimodal time series data often suffer from
interference, especially in the textual modality. Existing methods for
multimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations
within textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can
significantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits
varying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this
challenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for
Multimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.
PA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal
attention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings
while maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing
the model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz
continuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the
proposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering
strong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we
introduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic
evaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of
textual noise. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and temporal
settings demonstrate that PA-RNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines.

Abstract: Consider a collection of competing machine learning algorithms. Given their
performance on a benchmark of datasets, we would like to identify the best
performing algorithm. Specifically, which algorithm is most likely to rank
highest on a future, unseen dataset. A natural approach is to select the
algorithm that demonstrates the best performance on the benchmark. However, in
many cases the performance differences are marginal and additional candidates
may also be considered. This problem is formulated as subset selection for
multinomial distributions. Formally, given a sample from a countable alphabet,
our goal is to identify a minimal subset of symbols that includes the most
frequent symbol in the population with high confidence. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework for the subset selection problem. We provide both
asymptotic and finite-sample schemes that significantly improve upon currently
known methods. In addition, we provide matching lower bounds, demonstrating the
favorable performance of our proposed schemes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfoQ是一种无需训练的混合精度量化框架，通过单次前向传播测量互信息变化来评估层敏感性，并利用整数线性规划高效分配比特宽度，显著提升了搜索效率和模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖计算昂贵的搜索算法或局部敏感性启发式代理（如Hessian），无法捕捉量化误差的全局影响。InfoQ提出通过信息流变化评估层敏感性。

Method: InfoQ通过单次前向传播量化每层不同比特宽度，测量后续层互信息变化，将比特分配问题转化为整数线性规划问题。

Result: 在ImageNet上，InfoQ比现有方法（如LIMPQ）使用少两个数量级数据，搜索效率更高，MobileNetV2和ResNet18精度提升1%，压缩率分别达14X和10.66X。

Conclusion: InfoQ通过全局信息流敏感性评估和高效比特分配，实现了高压缩率下的精度提升和搜索效率优化。

Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural
networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for
each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current
state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or
local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the
cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the
quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local
properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire
network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in
the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each
layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the
resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This
quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information
flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an
integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize
total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our
retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off
(using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods
such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2
and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE和Poisson-VAE无法准确模拟神经活动的变异性，尤其是均值与方差的刚性约束问题。

Method: 引入负二项分布建模神经活动，开发了两种ELBO优化方案和两种可微分重参数化策略。

Result: 实验表明，NegBio-VAE在重建精度上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 负二项分布能更准确地模拟神经活动的过分散性，为神经表征提供了更广泛的模型。

Abstract: Biological neurons communicate through spike trains, discrete, irregular
bursts of activity that exhibit variability far beyond the modeling capacity of
conventional variational autoencoders (VAEs). Recent work, such as the
Poisson-VAE, makes a biologically inspired move by modeling spike counts using
the Poisson distribution. However, they impose a rigid constraint: equal mean
and variance, which fails to reflect the true stochastic nature of neural
activity. In this work, we challenge this constraint and introduce NegBio-VAE,
a principled extension of the VAE framework that models spike counts using the
negative binomial distribution. This shift grants explicit control over
dispersion, unlocking a broader and more accurate family of neural
representations. We further develop two ELBO optimization schemes and two
differentiable reparameterization strategies tailored to the negative binomial
setting. By introducing one additional dispersion parameter, NegBio-VAE
generalizes the Poisson latent model to a negative binomial formulation.
Empirical results demonstrate this minor yet impactful change leads to
significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, highlighting the importance of
explicitly modeling overdispersion in spike-like activations.

Motivation: 解决RL-DTRs部署中的临床知识注入和患者安全问题，探索LLMs作为替代方案的潜力。

Result: 小规模LLMs在稳定患者中表现优异，但存在剂量过激、算术幻觉等问题，复杂生理动态捕捉有限。

Conclusion: 需结合提示工程、验证和混合方法，安全整合LLMs到临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold
promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical
deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject
clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior
knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic
prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we
rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in
silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference
performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly
trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot
prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or
superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,
particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable
limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including
arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical
logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,
meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's
limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through
textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic
integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of
targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid
approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological
modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support
systems.

Motivation: 极端天气事件频发，现有电力恢复策略因请求量差异导致不公平，弱势社区恢复较慢。

Method: 采用预测-优化框架EPOPR，包括公平分位数回归和时空注意力强化学习。

Result: 实验显示，EPOPR平均减少停电时间3.60%，降低社区间不公平14.19%。

Conclusion: EPOPR在效率和公平性上优于现有方法，为电力恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes,
highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system
restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily
based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However,
our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission
volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests.
This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving
these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim
to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both
restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this
goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair
durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement
learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine
equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize
framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized
Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2)
Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels
across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that
our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and
decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: 提出了F3CRec框架，包含客户端自适应回放记忆和服务器端项目时间均值两个关键组件。

Result: 实验表明F3CRec在联邦环境下能长期保持推荐质量，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: F3CRec成功整合了联邦学习和持续学习，为隐私保护和动态数据流下的推荐问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the
adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling
collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated
Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle
with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation
quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec)
methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data
access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that
integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data
while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework
designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict
constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay
Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on
user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which
integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in
maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.

Result: 在深圳和纽约的真实数据测试中，HCRide将系统效率提升2.02%，公平性提升5.39%，司机偏好提升10.21%。

Conclusion: HCRide成功平衡了系统效率、乘客公平性和司机偏好，为网约车系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which
directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience.
Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator
revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers.
Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by
considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising
the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target
due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference
since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we
design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel
multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented
Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a
multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic
network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver
preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two
real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental
results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%,
fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的流匹配框架为长范围标记事件序列建模提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling long horizon marked event sequences is a fundamental challenge in
many real-world applications, including healthcare, finance, and user behavior
modeling. Existing neural temporal point process models are typically
autoregressive, predicting the next event one step at a time, which limits
their efficiency and leads to error accumulation in long-range forecasting. In
this work, we propose a unified flow matching framework for marked temporal
point processes that enables non-autoregressive, joint modeling of inter-event
times and event types, via continuous and discrete flow matching. By learning
continuous-time flows for both components, our method generates coherent long
horizon event trajectories without sequential decoding. We evaluate our model
on six real-world benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over
autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and generation
efficiency.

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a standard for in-vehicle
communication but remains susceptible to cyber-attacks due to its lack of
built-in security. This paper presents a multi-stage intrusion detection
framework leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph
learning tailored for automotive CAN traffic. Our architecture combines a
Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for structural anomaly detection with a
Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for robust attack
classification. CAN bus activity is encoded as graph sequences to model
temporal and relational dependencies. The pipeline applies VGAE-based selective
undersampling to address class imbalance, followed by GAT classification with
optional score-level fusion. The compact student GAT achieves 96% parameter
reduction compared to the teacher model while maintaining strong predictive
performance. Experiments on six public CAN intrusion datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test--demonstrate competitive accuracy and
efficiency, with average improvements of 16.2% in F1-score over existing
methods, particularly excelling on highly imbalanced datasets with up to 55%
F1-score improvements.

Motivation: OPTQ作为一种高效的PTQ算法，缺乏严格的理论保证，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析OPTQ的迭代过程和量化误差，推导出非渐近的2-范数误差界限，并扩展到Qronos算法。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the
memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large
language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as
GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and
strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ
lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the
first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants
of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ
algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error
and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the
calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis
provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices,
including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as
well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic
variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control
over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for
downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to
Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and
stochastic variants, that help explain its empirical advantages.

TL;DR: Agnostics是一种语言无关的后训练管道，通过观察代码的外部行为来验证多语言代码，无需为每种语言单独设计测试框架，显著提升了低资源语言的代码生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在低资源编程语言中表现不佳的问题，避免为每种语言单独设计数据集和测试框架的繁琐工作。

Method: 1. 将现有单元测试数据集转换为I/O格式；2. 提供简短的配置指导验证器如何编译和运行目标语言；3. 在稳健的代码执行环境中应用可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）。

Result: 在五种低资源语言（Lua、Julia、R、OCaml、Fortran）中，Agnostics显著提升了模型性能，甚至媲美更大规模的模型，并在多个基准测试中创下新纪录。

Conclusion: Agnostics提供了一种高效、通用的方法，简化了多语言代码生成的后训练过程，为低资源语言的开发提供了支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) already excel at writing code in high-resource
languages such as Python and JavaScript, yet stumble on low-resource languages
that remain essential to science and engineering. Besides the obvious shortage
of pre-training data, post-training itself is a bottleneck: every new language
seems to require new datasets, test harnesses, and reinforcement-learning (RL)
infrastructure.
  We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that
eliminates this per-language engineering. The key idea is to judge code solely
by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions
written in any language. Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing
unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that
tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code
execution environment.
  Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and
Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other
16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model
families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for
${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on
MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce.
  We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X,
Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use
configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple
as editing a short YAML file.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的神经算子架构HNO，通过结合希尔伯特变换来改进现有FNO的局限性，特别适用于因果、相位敏感和非平稳系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Fourier神经算子（FNO）在频域进行卷积，但受限于傅里叶变换的周期性假设，且缺乏对信号瞬时特性的有效利用。

Method: HNO通过希尔伯特变换将输入信号映射为解析表示，显式提取瞬时振幅和相位信息，并在此基础上进行谱卷积学习。

Result: HNO能够更有效地建模因果、相位敏感和非平稳系统的算子。

Conclusion: HNO通过引入信号处理的强归纳偏置，为神经算子提供了一种新的有效架构。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful, data-driven paradigm for
learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs).
State-of-the-art architectures, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have
achieved remarkable success by performing convolutions in the frequency domain,
making them highly effective for a wide range of problems. However, this method
has some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier
transform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond
phase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information
to learn an effective network. We introduce the \textbf{Hilbert Neural Operator
(HNO)}, a new neural operator architecture to address some advantages by
incorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing. HNO operates by
first mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert
transform, thereby making instantaneous amplitude and phase information
explicit features for the learning process. The core learnable operation -- a
spectral convolution -- is then applied to this Hilbert-transformed
representation. We hypothesize that this architecture enables HNO to model
operators more effectively for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary
systems. We formalize the HNO architecture and provide the theoretical
motivation for its design, rooted in analytic signal theory.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于不确定性感知的U-Net架构，结合贝叶斯和分位数回归方法，用于预测MOMO-Chem模型的地表臭氧残差（偏差），并评估了其在北美和欧洲的区域偏差估计能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地表臭氧（O3）是一种重要污染物，但其趋势驱动因素难以建模，传统物理模型在人类健康相关尺度上实用性不足。深度学习模拟器虽能捕捉复杂气候模式，但缺乏可解释性，无法支持政策制定和公共卫生措施的决策。

Method: 采用不确定性感知的U-Net架构，结合贝叶斯和分位数回归方法，预测MOMO-Chem模型的地表臭氧残差，并评估区域偏差估计能力。

Result: 在2019年6月北美和欧洲的区域偏差估计中展示了方法的有效性，比较了两种不确定性量化（UQ）方法的得分，并确定了适合MOMO-Chem偏差校正的地面站点。

Conclusion: 该方法为地表臭氧残差建模提供了实用工具，支持政策制定和公共卫生措施的决策，同时强调了土地利用信息在建模中的重要性。

Abstract: Air pollution is a global hazard, and as of 2023, 94\% of the world's
population is exposed to unsafe pollution levels. Surface Ozone (O3), an
important pollutant, and the drivers of its trends are difficult to model, and
traditional physics-based models fall short in their practical use for scales
relevant to human-health impacts. Deep Learning-based emulators have shown
promise in capturing complex climate patterns, but overall lack the
interpretability necessary to support critical decision making for policy
changes and public health measures. We implement an uncertainty-aware U-Net
architecture to predict the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data
assimilation (MOMO-Chem) model's surface ozone residuals (bias) using Bayesian
and quantile regression methods. We demonstrate the capability of our
techniques in regional estimation of bias in North America and Europe for June
2019. We highlight the uncertainty quantification (UQ) scores between our two
UQ methodologies and discern which ground stations are optimal and sub-optimal
candidates for MOMO-Chem bias correction, and evaluate the impact of land-use
information in surface ozone residual modeling.

Result: 该方法在北美和欧洲的表现优于传统机器学习方法，能更好地捕捉物理模型的偏差。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于科学理解影响城市尺度臭氧偏差的因素，并为改进环境政策提供支持。

Abstract: Air pollution is the world's largest environmental risk factor for human
disease and premature death, resulting in more than 6 million permature deaths
in 2019. Currently, there is still a challenge to model one of the most
important air pollutants, surface ozone, particularly at scales relevant for
human health impacts, with the drivers of global ozone trends at these scales
largely unknown, limiting the practical use of physics-based models. We employ
a 2D Convolutional Neural Network based architecture that estimate surface
ozone MOMO-Chem model residuals, referred to as model bias. We demonstrate the
potential of this technique in North America and Europe, highlighting its
ability better to capture physical model residuals compared to a traditional
machine learning method. We assess the impact of incorporating land use
information from high-resolution satellite imagery to improve model estimates.
Importantly, we discuss how our results can improve our scientific
understanding of the factors impacting ozone bias at urban scales that can be
used to improve environmental policy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种检索增强预测（RAF）框架，用于提高水文领域的水位预测准确性，通过检索历史类似水文事件来增强模型输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的水位预测对生态系统管理至关重要，但现有深度学习模型在水文领域的应用不足且泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出RAF框架，通过检索历史类似水文事件并整合到模型输入中，无需任务特定的重新训练或微调。

Result: 在Everglades的真实数据上验证，RAF显著提高了水位预测的准确性。

Conclusion: RAF方法在水文领域具有潜力，为生态系统管理中自适应AI方法的广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems such as
the Everglades, a subtropical wetland vital for flood mitigation, drought
management, water resource planning, and biodiversity conservation. While
recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models,
have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in
hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize
across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective
mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a
framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological
episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an
external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant
patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and
predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and
mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on
real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework
yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study
highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves
the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in
ecosystem management. The code and data are available at

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of machine learning models for neonatal seizure detection
is critical for clinical adoption. Current practices often rely on inconsistent
and biased metrics, hindering model comparability and interpretability.
Expert-level claims about AI performance are frequently made without rigorous
validation, raising concerns about their reliability. This study aims to
systematically evaluate common performance metrics and propose best practices
tailored to the specific challenges of neonatal seizure detection. Using real
and synthetic seizure annotations, we assessed standard performance metrics,
consensus strategies, and human-expert level equivalence tests under varying
class imbalance, inter-rater agreement, and number of raters. Matthews and
Pearson's correlation coefficients outperformed the area under the curve in
reflecting performance under class imbalance. Consensus types are sensitive to
the number of raters and agreement level among them. Among human-expert level
equivalence tests, the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k best captured
expert-level AI performance. We recommend reporting: (1) at least one balanced
metric, (2) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, (3) Multi-rater Turing test
results using Fleiss k, and (4) All the above on held-out validation set. This
proposed framework provides an important prerequisite to clinical validation by
enabling a thorough and honest appraisal of AI methods for neonatal seizure
detection.

Result: 实验表明，高适应性策略（如基于梯度的选择）性能优越但可复现性差，而低适应性策略可复现性较好。预训练能显著降低可复现性失败率。

Conclusion: 研究为迁移学习中的性能与可复现性权衡提供了指导，强调了可复现性设计的重要性。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of transfer learning has revolutionized machine
learning by enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains.
However, the reliability of these adaptations remains poorly understood,
particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically
prioritize training examples. We present a comprehensive theoretical and
empirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a
mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between
adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the
formalization of selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures
how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We
prove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two
independent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than
a threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while
decreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the
MultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform
sampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical
relationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly
adaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve
superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,
while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we
show that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism,
reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains. These
findings establish principled guidelines for practitioners to navigate the
performance-replicability trade-off and highlight the need for
replicability-aware design in modern transfer learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论在社交媒体上广泛存在，对社会、心理甚至物理层面造成严重影响。现有的深度学习方法（如RNN、LSTM、CNN）存在长期依赖和并行化效率低等问题，需要更高效的自动化检测方法。

Method: 本研究使用MetaHate数据集（包含36个数据集，120万个社交媒体样本），评估了多种Transformer模型（如BERT、RoBERTa、GPT-2和ELECTRA）的性能。

Result: 微调的ELECTRA模型表现最佳，F1分数达到0.8980。研究还发现分类错误主要源于讽刺、编码语言和标签噪声等挑战。

Conclusion: Transformer模型（尤其是ELECTRA）在仇恨言论检测中表现出色，但仍需解决讽刺和编码语言等复杂问题。

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse,
encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social,
psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and
communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook,
Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication,
they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been
linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the
development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social
media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues
such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study
represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate
speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets
with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art
transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with
fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We
also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded
language, and label noise.

Conclusion: ALScope为深度主动学习提供了统一评估平台，揭示了算法在不同场景下的表现差异和改进需求。

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most
informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications
become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g.,
open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention,
prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a
unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse
conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification
tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both
classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as
distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible
configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset
choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio,
and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We
conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our
findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across
domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and
open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further
investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require
significantly longer selection time.

Conclusion: REINA为同步语音翻译提供了一种有效的方法，显著优化了延迟与翻译质量的权衡。

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while
simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the
significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We
introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you
gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized
Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive
policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from
information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported
Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing
REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and
into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we
achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable
size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively
showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared
to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如Bagging和Boosting在平衡个体学习器准确性与多样性方面缺乏精确控制，而NCL虽然引入惩罚项但理论边界松散。

Method: SEA将集成误差分解为个体性能项和多样性项，并在损失函数中引入可调参数，实现对两者的精确控制。

Result: 实验表明，SEA在多个公共数据集上优于基线方法，且具有更灵活的调整能力和更一致的多样性变化。

Conclusion: SEA提供了更广泛的调整范围和更紧的理论边界，显著提升了集成学习的性能。

Abstract: Ensemble learning boosts performance by aggregating predictions from multiple
base learners. A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with
diversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity
through randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity
trade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage
this trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment
range. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called
Self-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct
components: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each
base learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This
decomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss
function, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,
thus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its
variants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more
consistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical
bounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical
experiments. Experimental results on several public regression and
classification datasets demonstrate that SEA consistently outperforms baseline
methods across all tasks. Ablation studies confirm that SEA offers more
flexible adjustment capabilities and superior performance in fine-tuning
strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving
nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both
algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a
message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum
acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is
highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition
in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides,
because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the
compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.
  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed
decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed
communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded
gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which
applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data
heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and
they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic
parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance.
Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on
training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.

Abstract: Foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) signals have recently
demonstrated success in learning generalized representations of EEGs,
outperforming specialized models in various downstream tasks. However, many of
these models lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited
insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For
successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency
in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned
representations. Current approaches primarily operate in the temporal domain,
overlooking advancements in digital signal processing that enable the
extraction of deterministic and traceable features, such as wavelet-based
representations. We propose MENDR (Manifold Explainable Neural Data
Representations), a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel
Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture to resolve these issues. MENDR
learns symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals and is
pretrained on a large corpus comprising over 4,000 hours of EEG data,
decomposed via discrete wavelet packet transforms into multi-resolution
coefficients. MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing
symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports
accurate reconstruction of EEG signals from learned embeddings. Evaluations
across multiple clinical EEG tasks demonstrate that MENDR achieves near
state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer parameters, underscoring
its potential for efficient, interpretable, and clinically applicable EEG
analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态因果干预模型（MMCI），通过后门调整解决多模态情感分析中的虚假相关性，提升模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态情感分析中易受虚假相关性影响，导致模型依赖统计捷径而非真实因果关系，影响泛化性能。

Method: 将多模态输入建模为多关系图，利用注意力机制分离因果特征与捷径特征，并通过后门调整动态结合这些特征。

Result: 在多个标准数据集和分布外测试集上，MMCI有效抑制了偏差并提升了性能。

Conclusion: MMCI通过因果干预显著改善了多模态情感分析的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human emotions by
integrating information from multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and
visual data. However, existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations
both within and across modalities, leading models to rely on statistical
shortcuts rather than true causal relationships, thereby undermining
generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational
Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor
adjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such
shortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a
multi-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal
dependencies. Then, we apply an attention mechanism to separately estimate and
disentangle the causal features and shortcut features corresponding to these
intra- and inter-modal relations. Finally, by applying the backdoor adjustment,
we stratify the shortcut features and dynamically combine them with the causal
features to encourage MMCI to produce stable predictions under distribution
shifts. Extensive experiments on several standard MSA datasets and
out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets demonstrate that our method effectively
suppresses biases and improves performance.

TL;DR: R-Zero是一个完全自主的框架，通过两个独立模型（Challenger和Solver）的交互生成训练数据，无需人工标注，显著提升了LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM训练方法依赖人工标注任务和标签，限制了AI系统超越人类智能的能力发展。

Method: R-Zero通过Challenger生成任务，Solver解决任务，两者通过交互共同进化，形成自我改进的课程。

Result: R-Zero显著提升了LLM的推理能力，例如在数学推理和通用推理基准上分别提升了6.49和7.54分。

Conclusion: R-Zero为LLM的自主进化提供了可行路径，突破了依赖人工标注的瓶颈。

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的微调方法需要大量数据和计算资源，限制了小模型的实用性。现有课程学习或数据选择方法多为启发式或计算密集型，缺乏可扩展性和通用性。

Method: SPaRFT采用基于聚类的数据缩减和多臂老虎机策略，动态选择训练数据，优化学习效率。

Conclusion: SPaRFT证明，通过精心设计的数据选择和自适应学习策略，可以在资源有限的情况下显著提升大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when
fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL). However, such methods require
extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models. Current
approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely
heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their
scalability and generalizability. We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced
learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of
the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when. First,
we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by
semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces
redundancy. Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms,
optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance.
Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves
comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to
\(100\times\) fewer samples. Ablation studies and analyses further highlight
the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection. Our results
demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can
unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.

Motivation: AR系统在提升任务表现的同时可能导致认知隧道效应，影响安全关键场景中的SA。研究旨在探索AR引导CPR中SA的表现及其预测方法。

Method: 开发了Magic Leap 2上的AR应用，提供实时CPR反馈，并通过模拟意外事件（如出血）收集SA数据。使用眼动追踪分析SA，并提出FixGraphPool模型预测SA。

Result: 眼动追踪显示，较高的SA与更大的扫视幅度和速度相关，且减少了对虚拟内容的注视。FixGraphPool模型在预测SA上表现优异（准确率83.0%）。

Conclusion: 眼动追踪可用于AR中的SA建模，为设计兼顾用户安全和SA的AR系统提供了依据。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through
real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on
virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical
scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with
vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR
app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth
and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g.,
bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation
and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking
analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic
amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations
on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural
network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal
graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved
83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and
state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and
spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the
potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in
designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.

Method: 提出KNOW预测策略，利用结构化遗忘过程及其逆过程合成知识增强的权重。通过逐步缩小数据集的顺序微调诱导结构化遗忘，并利用元学习建模权重预测。

Conclusion: 本文通过重新解释遗忘动态，为深度学习中的知识迁移提供了新视角，并展示了KNOW预测的有效性。

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task
performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental
question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate
more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce
\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that
leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize
knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on
progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which
can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger
dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this
controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction
effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster
(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and
predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction
consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,
leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective
on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer
in deep learning.

Motivation: 解决图学习中能量区域平坦或病态时的信号传播问题，同时缓解过压缩现象。

Method: 结合可学习的Lyapunov函数和消息传递生成的切向分量，分解为能量梯度下降和切向演化的正交流。

Result: 在多种节点和图分类、回归基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 联合学习能量函数和切向流对图神经网络有效。

Abstract: We introduce TANGO -- a dynamical systems inspired framework for graph
representation learning that governs node feature evolution through a learned
energy landscape and its associated descent dynamics. At the core of our
approach is a learnable Lyapunov function over node embeddings, whose gradient
defines an energy-reducing direction that guarantees convergence and stability.
To enhance flexibility while preserving the benefits of energy-based dynamics,
we incorporate a novel tangential component, learned via message passing, that
evolves features while maintaining the energy value. This decomposition into
orthogonal flows of energy gradient descent and tangential evolution yields a
flexible form of graph dynamics, and enables effective signal propagation even
in flat or ill-conditioned energy regions, that often appear in graph learning.
Our method mitigates oversquashing and is compatible with different graph
neural network backbones. Empirically, TANGO achieves strong performance across
a diverse set of node and graph classification and regression benchmarks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly learned energy functions and
tangential flows for graph neural networks.

Result: 实验表明，Integrated Influence在数据归因和错误标注识别任务中比现有方法更可靠。

Conclusion: Integrated Influence通过引入基线和集体影响分析，提升了数据归因的可靠性和解释灵活性。

Abstract: As an effective approach to quantify how training samples influence test
sample, data attribution is crucial for understanding data and model and
further enhance the transparency of machine learning models. We find that
prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy
suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only
perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the
training set. On the other hand, the lack of baseline in many data attribution
methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide
counterfactual explanations. In this paper, we propose Integrated Influence, a
novel data attribution method that incorporates a baseline approach. Our method
defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition
the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each
sample throughout this process. We provide a solid theoretical framework for
our method, and further demonstrate that popular methods, such as influence
functions, can be viewed as special cases of our approach. Experimental results
show that Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions
compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislablled
example identification task.

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解了冷启动问题，提高了偏好学习在数据受限环境中的效率和适用性。

Abstract: Active preference learning is a powerful paradigm for efficiently modeling
preferences, yet it suffers from the cold-start problem: a significant drop in
performance when no initial labeled data is available. This challenge is
particularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where
labeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference
learning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised
pre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive
initial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a
cold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the
model is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a
simulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse
datasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career
success rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our
cold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin
from a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled
pairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the
cold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of
preference learning in data-constrained environments. We release our code at

Conclusion: 该框架通过多视角弱监督信号的互补性，显著提升了弱监督学习的性能，尤其在标签数据有限时表现突出。

Abstract: In practical machine learning applications, it is often challenging to assign
accurate labels to data, and increasing the number of labeled instances is
often limited. In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables
training with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and
effective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a
single type of weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel WSL
framework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple
relational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is
limited. Specifically, we introduce SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that
integrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and
confidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement
this method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for
classification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and
another newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We
prove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to
estimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach
to mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide
theoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against
inaccurate class prior probability and label noise. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing
baselines across a variety of settings.

Conclusion: 该方法在代码预训练模型上表现尤为突出，表明结构化语言生成能力为函数调用任务的强化学习提供了优势起点。

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models
in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop
robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely
on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods
struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present
a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative
policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically
tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical
challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy
learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and
inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation
pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation
and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall
accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function
scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on
code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation
capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning
in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to
benefit the community.

Conclusion: HFedATM为分层联邦学习中的领域偏移问题提供了有效解决方案，具有快速收敛和稳定训练的优势。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach where multiple clients
collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing their raw data.
Despite its effectiveness, conventional FL faces scalability challenges due to
excessive computational and communication demands placed on a single central
server as the number of participating devices grows. Hierarchical Federated
Learning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks
across intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and
robustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a
critical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data
distributions vary significantly across different clients and stations,
reducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain
Generalization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain
shifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization
(HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within
hierarchical architectures. Specifically, we propose HFedATM, a hierarchical
aggregation method that first aligns the convolutional filters of models from
different stations through Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and
subsequently merges aligned models using a Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean
Aggregation. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM
significantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across
multiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency.
Moreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter
generalization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging,
resulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive approximation result for deep
fully-connected neural networks with commonly-used and general activation
functions in Sobolev spaces $W^{n,\infty}$, with errors measured in the
$W^{m,p}$-norm for $m < n$ and $1\le p \le \infty$. The derived rates surpass
those of classical numerical approximation techniques, such as finite element
and spectral methods, exhibiting a phenomenon we refer to as
\emph{super-convergence}. Our analysis shows that deep networks with general
activations can approximate weak solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) with superior accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods at the
approximation level. Furthermore, this work closes a significant gap in the
error-estimation theory for neural-network-based approaches to PDEs, offering a
unified theoretical foundation for their use in scientific computing.

Motivation: 现有AutoML系统在后验集成阶段采用固定策略，无法适应任务特性，限制了集成性能的提升。

Method: 通过二元二次规划选择基础模型，引入多层堆叠机制，并构建超参数空间搜索最优集成策略。

Result: 在80个公开数据集上，PSEO的平均测试排名（2.96）优于16种方法。

Conclusion: PSEO通过自适应优化后验集成策略，显著提升了AutoML系统的性能。

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH)
problem is fundamental in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Inspired by the
success of ensemble learning, recent AutoML systems construct post-hoc
ensembles for final predictions rather than relying on the best single model.
However, while most CASH methods conduct extensive searches for the optimal
single model, they typically employ fixed strategies during the ensemble phase
that fail to adapt to specific task characteristics. To tackle this issue, we
propose PSEO, a framework for post-hoc stacking ensemble optimization. First,
we conduct base model selection through binary quadratic programming, with a
trade-off between diversity and performance. Furthermore, we introduce two
mechanisms to fully realize the potential of multi-layer stacking. Finally,
PSEO builds a hyperparameter space and searches for the optimal post-hoc
ensemble strategy within it. Empirical results on 80 public datasets show that
\sys achieves the best average test rank (2.96) among 16 methods, including
post-hoc designs in recent AutoML systems and state-of-the-art ensemble

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于领域驱动的强化学习（RL）评估指标，用于优化基于代理的模型（ABMs）和理性代理模型（RABMs），并通过疾病建模案例展示了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于基于RL的ABMs和RABMs模型的复杂性和随机性，以及缺乏标准化的RL算法比较指标，评估其性能具有挑战性。

Method: 开发了领域驱动的RL评估指标，并结合传统和最新指标，应用于理性ABM疾病建模案例（如口罩使用、疫苗接种和封锁）。

Result: 研究结果表明，领域驱动的奖励与传统及最新指标结合，在不同模拟场景（如口罩供应差异）中表现良好。

Conclusion: 领域驱动的RL评估指标为复杂系统的RL优化提供了有效的评估工具。

Abstract: For the development and optimization of agent-based models (ABMs) and
rational agent-based models (RABMs), optimization algorithms such as
reinforcement learning are extensively used. However, assessing the performance
of RL-based ABMs and RABMS models is challenging due to the complexity and
stochasticity of the modeled systems, and the lack of well-standardized metrics
for comparing RL algorithms. In this study, we are developing domain-driven
metrics for RL, while building on state-of-the-art metrics. We demonstrate our
``Domain-driven-RL-metrics'' using policy optimization on a rational ABM
disease modeling case study to model masking behavior, vaccination, and
lockdown in a pandemic. Our results show the use of domain-driven rewards in
conjunction with traditional and state-of-the-art metrics for a few different
simulation scenarios such as the differential availability of masks.

*Thinh Nguyen,Le Huy Khiem,Van-Tuan Tran,Khoa D Doan,Nitesh V Chawla,Kok-Seng Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为pFedDSH的新框架，用于解决动态客户端加入的个性化联邦学习问题，通过超网络和掩码技术实现知识稳定性和高效迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化联邦学习方法假设客户端静态参与，而现实中新客户端可能动态加入，这带来了性能保持和知识迁移的挑战。

Method: 提出pFedDSH框架，基于中央超网络生成个性化模型，使用批特定掩码保持知识稳定性，并引入数据重放策略促进反向迁移。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上的实验表明，pFedDSH优于现有方法，实现了对现有客户端的稳定性能和新客户端的快速适应。

Conclusion: pFedDSH在动态客户端加入场景下表现出色，兼具性能稳定性和资源高效利用。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, offering a significant privacy
benefit. However, most existing Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) methods
assume a static client participation, which does not reflect real-world
scenarios where new clients may continuously join the federated system (i.e.,
dynamic client onboarding). In this paper, we explore a practical scenario in
which a new batch of clients is introduced incrementally while the learning
task remains unchanged. This dynamic environment poses various challenges,
including preserving performance for existing clients without retraining and
enabling efficient knowledge transfer between client batches. To address these
issues, we propose Personalized Federated Data-Free Sub-Hypernetwork (pFedDSH),
a novel framework based on a central hypernetwork that generates personalized
models for each client via embedding vectors. To maintain knowledge stability
for existing clients, pFedDSH incorporates batch-specific masks, which activate
subsets of neurons to preserve knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free
replay strategy motivated by DeepInversion to facilitate backward transfer,
enhancing existing clients' performance without compromising privacy. Extensive
experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate
that pFedDSH outperforms the state-of-the-art pFL and Federated Continual
Learning baselines in our investigation scenario. Our approach achieves robust
performance stability for existing clients, as well as adaptation for new
clients and efficient utilization of neural resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S$^2$M-Former是一种新型的尖峰对称混合框架，用于解决听觉注意力检测（AAD）中的能量效率问题，通过生物启发的架构和轻量级设计，显著降低能耗并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG-based AAD方法缺乏能充分利用互补EEG特征且满足能量效率限制的协同框架，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出S$^2$M-Former，采用尖峰驱动的对称架构和轻量级1D令牌序列，减少参数和能耗。

Result: 在三个AAD基准测试中，S$^2$M-Former实现了与SOTA相当的解码精度，同时参数减少14.7倍，能耗降低5.8倍。

Conclusion: S$^2$M-Former为AAD任务提供了一种低功耗、高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to decode listeners' focus in complex
auditory environments from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which is
crucial for developing neuro-steered hearing devices. Despite recent
advancements, EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic
frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under
energy-efficiency constraints. We propose S$^2$M-Former, a novel spiking
symmetric mixing framework to address this limitation through two key
innovations: i) Presenting a spike-driven symmetric architecture composed of
parallel spatial and frequency branches with mirrored modular design,
leveraging biologically plausible token-channel mixers to enhance complementary
learning across branches; ii) Introducing lightweight 1D token sequences to
replace conventional 3D operations, reducing parameters by 14.7$\times$. The
brain-inspired spiking architecture further reduces power consumption,
achieving a 5.8$\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods, while
also surpassing existing SNN baselines in terms of parameter efficiency and
performance. Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and
AV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject)
demonstrate that S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA)
decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution
for AAD tasks.

TL;DR: HIA（启发式引导的推理时对齐）是一种无需调优、兼容黑盒的方法，通过轻量级提示优化器和启发式奖励模型，在减少推理调用的同时保持对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时通常忽略对齐质量与计算成本之间的平衡，HIA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HIA使用轻量级提示优化器、启发式奖励模型和两阶段过滤，减少推理调用。

Result: 在HelpSteer和ComPRed数据集上，HIA在相同推理预算下优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: HIA在低推理预算下仍有效，为可扩展的个性化LLM部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often
requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between
alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods
typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's
performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a
tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt
optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference
calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets,
HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and
greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the
same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference
budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical
solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

Abstract: We developed a ResNet-based human activity recognition (HAR) model with
minimal overhead to detect gait versus non-gait activities and everyday
activities (walking, running, stairs, standing, sitting, lying, sit-to-stand
transitions). The model was trained and evaluated using smartphone sensor data
from adult healthy controls (HC) and people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 0.0-6.5. Datasets
included the GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728), an internal Roche dataset, and
publicly available data sources (training only). Data from 34 HC and 68 PwMS
(mean [SD] EDSS: 4.7 [1.5]) were included in the evaluation. The HAR model
showed 98.4% and 99.6% accuracy in detecting gait versus non-gait activities in
the GaitLab and Roche datasets, respectively, similar to a comparative
state-of-the-art ResNet model (99.3% and 99.4%). For everyday activities, the
proposed model not only demonstrated higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art
model (96.2% vs 91.9%; internal Roche dataset) but also maintained high
performance across 9 smartphone wear locations (handbag, shopping bag,
crossbody bag, backpack, hoodie pocket, coat/jacket pocket, hand, neck, belt),
outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 2.8% - 9.0%. In conclusion, the
proposed HAR model accurately detects everyday activities and shows high
robustness to various smartphone wear locations, demonstrating its practical
applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如全展开法和自回归法）在长期预测中存在因果依赖捕捉不足和误差积累问题，限制了长期准确性。

Method: PITI-DeepONet采用双输出架构，通过物理信息或混合目标训练，学习时间导数算子并结合经典时间步进方案。

Result: 在多个基准问题中，PITI-DeepONet的均方误差显著降低（如热方程降低84%），长期预测准确性优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PITI-DeepONet为复杂时间依赖PDEs的长期可靠积分提供了新途径。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and inferring solutions to time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs) over extended horizons remains a core challenge
in scientific machine learning. Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which
predict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal
dependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon.
Autoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from
error accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the
long-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues,
we introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network
(PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed
or hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate
long-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting
future states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current
state, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the
solution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring
during inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system
transitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems,
PITI-DeepONet shows improved accuracy over extended inference time horizons
when compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ errors
reduced by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional heat equation;
by 87% (vs. FR) and 98% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional Burgers equation; and
by 42% (vs. FR) and 89% (vs. AR) for the two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation.
By moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for
more reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.

Motivation: 金融领域对LLMs的准确性要求极高，现有幻觉基准难以满足其独特需求，需开发专门评估方法。

Method: 采用上下文感知的掩码跨度预测任务，基于真实财务文档，开发自动化数据集创建方法，并构建S&P 500年报数据集。

Result: 论文提供了评估LLMs在金融表格数据中内在幻觉的全面方法，并揭示了现有模型的幻觉模式。

Conclusion: 该框架为内部LLM评估提供了可靠方法，是构建可信赖金融生成AI系统的重要一步。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language
Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from
tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor
numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance.
Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on
context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing
hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous
and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial
LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over
real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel,
automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new
hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a
comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in
state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust
methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward
building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线广告系统的检索阶段与排序阶段因无法实时获取精确竞价信号，导致平台收入和广告效果不佳。

Method: BAR框架通过Bidding-Aware Modeling（单调性约束学习和多任务蒸馏）和Asynchronous Near-Line Inference实现实时更新，Task-Attentive Refinement模块增强特征交互。

Result: 在阿里巴巴展示广告平台上的实验显示，BAR带来4.32%的平台收入增长和22.2%的广告曝光提升。

Conclusion: BAR有效解决了多阶段不一致性问题，显著提升了广告系统的性能和经济效益。

Abstract: Online advertising systems typically use a cascaded architecture to manage
massive requests and candidate volumes, where the ranking stages allocate
traffic based on eCPM (predicted CTR $\times$ Bid). With the increasing
popularity of auto-bidding strategies, the inconsistency between the
computationally sensitive retrieval stage and the ranking stages becomes more
pronounced, as the former cannot access precise, real-time bids for the vast ad
corpus. This discrepancy leads to sub-optimal platform revenue and advertiser
outcomes. To tackle this problem, we propose Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), a
model-based retrieval framework that addresses multi-stage inconsistency by
incorporating ad bid value into the retrieval scoring function. The core
innovation is Bidding-Aware Modeling, incorporating bid signals through
monotonicity-constrained learning and multi-task distillation to ensure
economically coherent representations, while Asynchronous Near-Line Inference
enables real-time updates to the embedding for market responsiveness.
Furthermore, the Task-Attentive Refinement module selectively enhances feature
interactions to disentangle user interest and commercial value signals.
Extensive offline experiments and full-scale deployment across Alibaba's
display advertising platform validated BAR's efficacy: 4.32% platform revenue
increase with 22.2% impression lift for positively-operated advertisements.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的基于倾向得分的权重方法DFW，用于解决观测数据中的选择偏差问题，通过去混淆因子构建稳定有效的样本权重，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测数据中的选择偏差导致治疗组间协变量分布不平衡，传统倾向得分加权方法（如IPW）因权重不稳定而效果受限。

Method: 提出Deconfounding Factor Weighting (DFW)，利用去混淆因子构建稳定权重，优先处理低混淆样本，抑制高混淆样本影响。

Result: DFW在真实和合成数据集上优于IPW和CBPS，实现了更好的协变量平衡和治疗效果估计。

Conclusion: DFW是一种有效的倾向得分加权方法，适用于二元和多治疗场景，显著提升了选择偏差处理和治疗效果估计的稳定性。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is challenging due to
selection bias, which leads to imbalanced covariate distributions across
treatment groups. Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to
address this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled
trial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the
observed data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,
inverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the
propensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores
have high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately
degrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect
estimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor
Weighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the
deconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW
prioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly
confounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.
Our approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate
balance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to
multi-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the
estimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.
Through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,
we demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,
in both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.

Motivation: 传统集中式联邦学习存在单点故障、个性化不足和对数据分布变化的脆弱性。

Result: 在对抗性和异构条件下，LIGHTYEAR优于集中式和其他P2P方法。

Conclusion: 去中心化P2P框架LIGHTYEAR显著提升了联邦学习的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local.
Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a
central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this
architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of
failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or
vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in
centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be
unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and
offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,
peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P
topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of
trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided
Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement
Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an
agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the
semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to
the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored
subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that
further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets
shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized
baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance,
particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

Motivation: 解决传统PEFT方法（如LoRA）与基础模型架构紧密耦合的问题，提升其在不同预训练大语言模型中的适用性。

Method: 通过LoRA-Align进行子空间对齐（使用SVD和Frobenius最优线性变换），再通过LoRA-Shift将源LoRA权重更新投影到目标模型参数空间。

Result: 在ARCs、OBOA和HellaSwag等任务中，Cross-LoRA相对基础模型提升高达5.26%，在其他常识推理基准上表现接近直接训练的LoRA适配器。

Conclusion: Cross-LoRA是一种高效、轻量的方法，能够在不同模型间迁移LoRA模块，且无需额外数据或训练。

Abstract: Traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA are
tightly coupled with the base model architecture, which constrains their
applicability across heterogeneous pretrained large language models (LLMs). To
address this limitation, we introduce Cross-LoRA, a data-free framework for
transferring LoRA modules between diverse base models without requiring
additional training data. Cross-LoRA consists of two key components: (a)
LoRA-Align, which performs subspace alignment between source and target base
models through rank-truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) and
Frobenius-optimal linear transformation, ensuring compatibility under dimension
mismatch; and (b) LoRA-Shift, which applies the aligned subspaces to project
source LoRA weight updates into the target model parameter space. Both
components are data-free, training-free, and enable lightweight adaptation on a
commodity GPU in 20 minutes. Experiments on ARCs, OBOA and HellaSwag show that
Cross-LoRA achieves relative gains of up to 5.26% over base models. Across
other commonsense reasoning benchmarks, Cross-LoRA maintains performance
comparable to that of directly trained LoRA adapters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有MoE压缩方法在压缩率较低时仍导致显著精度下降的问题。

Method: 通过将专家矩阵分解为独特矩阵A和共享基矩阵B的线性组合，最小化重构误差。

Result: MoBE在压缩Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507等模型时，参数减少24%-30%，精度仅下降1%-2%。

Conclusion: MoBE是一种高效的MoE压缩方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a predominant paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs). Despite offering strong performance
and computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Kimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory
requirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to
address this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy
drops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper
introduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model
compression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate
matrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where
matrix A is unique to each expert. The relatively larger matrix B is further
re-parameterized as a linear combination of basis matrices {Bi} shared across
all experts within a given MoE layer. The factorization is learned by
minimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices.
Experiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops
compared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of
Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by
24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured
relatively).

Abstract: Marine chlorophyll concentration is an important indicator of ecosystem
health and carbon cycle strength, and its accurate prediction is crucial for
red tide warning and ecological response. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-RF
hybrid model that combines the advantages of LSTM and RF, which solves the
deficiencies of a single model in time-series modelling and nonlinear feature
portrayal. Trained with multi-source ocean data(temperature, salinity,
dissolved oxygen, etc.), the experimental results show that the LSTM-RF model
has an R^2 of 0.5386, an MSE of 0.005806, and an MAE of 0.057147 on the test
set, which is significantly better than using LSTM (R^2 = 0.0208) and RF (R^2
=0.4934) alone , respectively. The standardised treatment and sliding window
approach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an
innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological

### [73] [FlowState: Sampling Rate Invariant Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05287)
*Lars Graf,Thomas Ortner,Stanisław Woźniak,Angeliki Pantazi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowState是一种新型时间序列基础模型（TSFM），通过状态空间模型编码器和函数基解码器解决了现有TSFM在泛化性、适应性和计算效率上的不足，实现了跨时间尺度的动态调整和高效预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型在泛化性、适应性和计算效率方面表现不佳，无法满足不同时间分辨率和预测范围的需求。

Method: FlowState采用状态空间模型（SSM）编码器和函数基解码器，支持连续时间建模和动态时间尺度调整，并通过高效预训练策略提升鲁棒性和训练速度。

Result: FlowState在GIFT-ZS和Chronos-ZS基准测试中表现最优，且模型规模最小，数据需求更低，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: FlowState通过创新的架构设计，显著提升了时间序列预测的泛化性和适应性，成为当前最先进的TSFM。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but
their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time
series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle
with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack
adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient.
We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder
and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling
and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize
across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the
forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which
require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns
at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input
scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved
efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves
robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model,
FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS
and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of
its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to
varying input sampling rates.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide
satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional
supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell
time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a
fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to
maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We
specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement
information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational
LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The
architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t
+1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions
only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across
synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that
our RLHF-fine-tuned models can perform better in terms of top-$k$
recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction compared to
(arrow-zero-cmwrquca-teja-falset ensuite 2Round group-deca States penalty give
up This paper shows that implicit signal alignment can be efficient in
achieving scalable and user-adaptive design of CRS.

TL;DR: 论文研究了深度学习训练中批量大小和学习率的优化调度，以提高效率和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型的快速增长带来了计算瓶颈，而批量大小和学习率的调度对训练效率至关重要。

Method: 基于随机一阶预言机（SFO）复杂度理论，推导了批量大小和学习率的最优增长计划。

Result: 实验验证了理论推导的最优调度方案，显著降低了SFO复杂度。

Conclusion: 研究为深度学习中的大规模批量训练提供了理论和实践指导。

Abstract: The unprecedented growth of deep learning models has enabled remarkable
advances but introduced substantial computational bottlenecks. A key factor
contributing to training efficiency is batch-size and learning-rate scheduling
in stochastic gradient methods. However, naive scheduling of these
hyperparameters can degrade optimization efficiency and compromise
generalization. Motivated by recent theoretical insights, we investigated how
the batch size and learning rate should be increased during training to balance
efficiency and convergence. We analyzed this problem on the basis of stochastic
first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the expected number of gradient
evaluations needed to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the
empirical loss. We theoretically derived optimal growth schedules for the batch
size and learning rate that reduce SFO complexity and validated them through
extensive experiments. Our results offer both theoretical insights and
practical guidelines for scalable and efficient large-batch training in deep
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGD的收敛行为对批量大小和学习率设置高度敏感，现有理论研究表明存在一个临界批量大小可以最小化随机一阶预言机（SFO）复杂度。

Method: 引入了一种自适应调度策略，根据训练过程中观察到的全梯度范数衰减动态调整批量大小和学习率。

Result: 实验表明，基于该策略的自适应联合调度器相比现有调度器提高了收敛速度。

Conclusion: 自适应调度策略有效利用了临界批量大小的理论发现，显著提升了SGD的收敛效率。

Abstract: The convergence behavior of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is
highly sensitive to the batch size and learning rate settings. Recent
theoretical studies have identified the existence of a critical batch size that
minimizes stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the
expected number of gradient evaluations required to reach a stationary point of
the empirical loss function in a deep neural network. An adaptive scheduling
strategy is introduced to accelerate SGD that leverages theoretical findings on
the critical batch size. The batch size and learning rate are adjusted on the
basis of the observed decay in the full gradient norm during training.
Experiments using an adaptive joint scheduler based on this strategy
demonstrated improved convergence speed compared with that of existing
schedulers.

TL;DR: ASkDAgger框架通过利用新手计划中的信息，减少人类教师的教学负担，提高模仿学习的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类教学努力是交互式模仿学习广泛应用的主要瓶颈，现有方法未能充分利用新手计划中的信息。

Method: 提出ASkDAgger框架，包括S-Aware Gating、Foresight Interactive Experience Replay和Prioritized Interactive Experience Replay三个关键组件。

Result: 在模拟和现实环境中验证了ASkDAgger的有效性，减少了演示注释需求并提高了适应性。

Conclusion: ASkDAgger通过平衡查询频率与失败率，显著提升了交互式模仿学习的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Human teaching effort is a significant bottleneck for the broader
applicability of interactive imitation learning. To reduce the number of
required queries, existing methods employ active learning to query the human
teacher only in uncertain, risky, or novel situations. However, during these
queries, the novice's planned actions are not utilized despite containing
valuable information, such as the novice's capabilities, as well as
corresponding uncertainty levels. To this end, we allow the novice to say: "I
plan to do this, but I am uncertain." We introduce the Active Skill-level Data
Aggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the
novice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating
threshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)
Foresight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and
relabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized
Interactive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on
uncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age. Together, these components
balance query frequency with failure incidence, reduce the number of required
demonstration annotations, improve generalization, and speed up adaptation to
changing domains. We validate the effectiveness of ASkDAgger through
language-conditioned manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world
environments. Code, data, and videos are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少标注成本并处理持续数据流，同时解决无标签学习、记忆稳定性和学习可塑性的协同挑战。

Method: 提出USP框架，包括特征空间保留策略（FSR）、分而治之伪标签方法（DCP）和类均值锚定无标签蒸馏（CUD）。

Result: USP在最终准确率上优于现有方法，提升高达5.94%。

Conclusion: USP有效协同优化了半监督持续学习中的关键问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) seeks to leverage both labeled and
unlabeled data in a sequential learning setup, aiming to reduce annotation
costs while managing continual data arrival. SSCL introduces complex
challenges, including ensuring effective unlabeled learning (UL), while
balancing memory stability (MS) and learning plasticity (LP). Previous SSCL
efforts have typically focused on isolated aspects of the three, while this
work presents USP, a divide-and-conquer framework designed to synergistically
enhance these three aspects: (1) Feature Space Reservation (FSR) strategy for
LP, which constructs reserved feature locations for future classes by shaping
old classes into an equiangular tight frame; (2) Divide-and-Conquer
Pseudo-labeling (DCP) approach for UL, which assigns reliable pseudo-labels
across both high- and low-confidence unlabeled data; and (3)
Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) for MS, which reuses DCP's
outputs to anchor unlabeled data to stable class means for distillation to
prevent forgetting. Comprehensive evaluations show USP outperforms prior SSCL
methods, with gains up to 5.94% in the last accuracy, validating its
effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUyued/USP4SSCL.

TL;DR: OCAT（Optimal Corpus Aware Training）通过微调CAT预训练模型，仅调整少量与语料相关的参数，提升模型准确性，同时避免过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAT方法在训练前需预定义高质量数据组，容易出错且效率低。OCAT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: OCAT冻结大部分模型参数，仅微调少量与语料相关的参数，实现轻量化和高效性。

Result: 在WMT23英中和英德翻译任务中，OCAT分别提升chrF分数3.6和1.8，性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: OCAT是一种轻量、高效且鲁棒的微调方法，性能与现有技术相当或更优，且对超参数设置不敏感。

Abstract: Corpus Aware Training (CAT) leverages valuable corpus metadata during
training by injecting corpus information into each training example, and has
been found effective in the literature, commonly known as the "tagging"
approach. Models trained with CAT inherently learn the quality, domain and
nuance between corpora directly from data, and can easily switch to different
inference behavior. To achieve the best evaluation, CAT models pre-define a
group of high quality data before training starts which can be error-prone and
inefficient. In this work, we propose Optimal Corpus Aware Training (OCAT),
which fine-tunes a CAT pre-trained model by freezing most of the model
parameters and only tuning small set of corpus-related parameters. We show that
OCAT is lightweight, resilient to overfitting, and effective in boosting model
accuracy. We use WMT23 English to Chinese and English to German translation
tasks as our test ground and show +3.6 and +1.8 chrF improvement, respectively,
over vanilla training. Furthermore, our approach is on-par or slightly better
than other state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques while being less sensitive
to hyperparameter settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决个性化任务中探索成本高的问题，尤其是当潜在状态和奖励分布的联合模型难以获取或不准确时。

Method: 提出了一种后验采样算法，仅依赖动作偏好排序模型，允许相同潜在状态下奖励分布不同但偏好排序一致。

Result: 实验表明，该算法在奖励分布明确时与完全了解奖励分布的潜在老虎机性能相当，在奖励尺度不同时表现更优。

Conclusion: 放宽潜在老虎机的假设，仅依赖偏好排序模型，可以在更广泛的实际场景中有效减少探索成本。

Abstract: Bandit algorithms are guaranteed to solve diverse sequential decision-making
problems, provided that a sufficient exploration budget is available. However,
learning from scratch is often too costly for personalization tasks where a
single individual faces only a small number of decision points. Latent bandits
offer substantially reduced exploration times for such problems, given that the
joint distribution of a latent state and the rewards of actions is known and
accurate. In practice, finding such a model is non-trivial, and there may not
exist a small number of latent states that explain the responses of all
individuals. For example, patients with similar latent conditions may have the
same preference in treatments but rate their symptoms on different scales. With
this in mind, we propose relaxing the assumptions of latent bandits to require
only a model of the \emph{preference ordering} of actions in each latent state.
This allows problem instances with the same latent state to vary in their
reward distributions, as long as their preference orderings are equal. We give
a posterior-sampling algorithm for this problem and demonstrate that its
empirical performance is competitive with latent bandits that have full
knowledge of the reward distribution when this is well-specified, and
outperforms them when reward scales differ between instances with the same
latent state.

TL;DR: Echo是一个RL系统，通过解耦推理和训练阶段，利用异构硬件资源实现高效的大规模语言模型强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代RL后训练方法将轨迹采样和策略优化放在同一GPU集群上，导致系统在推理和训练工作负载之间频繁切换，违反了SPMD假设。

Method: Echo通过异构的“推理”和“训练”群组解耦这两个阶段，并引入两种轻量级同步协议：顺序拉取模式和异步推送-拉取模式。

Result: 在分布式集群上训练三种RL工作负载时，Echo在收敛速度和最终奖励上与完全共置的基线相当，同时将轨迹生成卸载到边缘硬件。

Conclusion: Echo证明了大规模RL可以利用分散的异构资源实现数据中心级性能。

Abstract: Modern RL-based post-training for large language models (LLMs) co-locate
trajectory sampling and policy optimisation on the same GPU cluster, forcing
the system to switch between inference and training workloads. This serial
context switching violates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) assumption
underlying today's distributed training systems. We present Echo, the RL system
that cleanly decouples these two phases across heterogeneous "inference" and
"training" swarms while preserving statistical efficiency. Echo introduces two
lightweight synchronization protocols: a sequential pull mode that refreshes
sampler weights on every API call for minimal bias, and an asynchronous
push-pull mode that streams version-tagged rollouts through a replay buffer to
maximise hardware utilisation. Training three representative RL workloads with
Qwen3-4B, Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-32B on a geographically distributed cluster,
Echo matches a fully co-located Verl baseline in convergence speed and final
reward while off-loading trajectory generation to commodity edge hardware.
These promising results demonstrate that large-scale RL for LLMs could achieve
datacentre-grade performance using decentralised, heterogeneous resources.

Result: 实验表明，NT-ML能有效防御6种后门攻击，性能优于5种现有防御方法。

Conclusion: NT-ML是一种高效的后门攻击防御机制，适用于少量干净样本的场景。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, where a designed trigger is injected into the dataset,
causing erroneous predictions when activated. In this paper, we propose a novel
defense mechanism, Non-target label Training and Mutual Learning (NT-ML), which
can successfully restore the poisoned model under advanced backdoor attacks. NT
aims to reduce the harm of poisoned data by retraining the model with the
outputs of the standard training. At this stage, a teacher model with high
accuracy on clean data and a student model with higher confidence in correct
prediction on poisoned data are obtained. Then, the teacher and student can
learn the strengths from each other through ML to obtain a purified student
model. Extensive experiments show that NT-ML can effectively defend against 6
backdoor attacks with a small number of clean samples, and outperforms 5
state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

Method: 重新审视了一种基于累积路径长度的自适应学习率调整方法，并针对Adam优化器的内部预处理问题提出了修正方案。通过实验对比了SGD和Adam在有无自适应机制下的表现。

Result: 修正后的自适应机制更符合Adam的更新动态，实验结果表明该方法在某些情况下能提供实际优势。

Conclusion: 本文明确了自适应学习率策略的适用场景和优势，为优化器的选择提供了参考。

Abstract: The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in deep learning, with its
ideal value depending on the problem and potentially changing during training.
In this paper, we investigate the practical utility of adaptive learning rate
mechanisms that adjust step sizes dynamically in response to the loss
landscape. We revisit a cumulative path-based adaptation scheme proposed in
2017, which adjusts the learning rate based on the discrepancy between the
observed path length, computed as a time-discounted sum of normalized gradient
steps, and the expected length of a random walk. While the original approach
offers a compelling intuition, we show that its adaptation mechanism for Adam
is conceptually inconsistent due to the optimizer's internal preconditioning.
We propose a corrected variant that better reflects Adam's update dynamics. To
assess the practical value of online learning rate adaptation, we benchmark SGD
and Adam, with and without cumulative adaptation, and compare them to a recent
alternative method. Our results aim to clarify when and why such adaptive
strategies offer practical benefits.

Abstract: Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental
task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often
struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast
inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that
addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a
Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens
and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation.
Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes
existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of
Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables
efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and
diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks
demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity
across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function
evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for
unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over
diffusion-based methods.

first to explore ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during extreme
volatility. We also conduct chaos analysis through the Lyapunov exponent in

Lyapunov exponent analysis, showing that ESNs are robust during chaotic periods

Result: 在非独立同分布数据上，CR-FMOL提升了客户端公平性，早期性能略低于FedAvg但后期可达到相近精度。

Conclusion: CR-FMOL是首个实现客户端Pareto最优的联邦多目标学习框架，具有潜力。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted paradigm for privacy-preserving
model training, but FedAvg optimise for the majority while under-serving
minority clients. Existing methods such as federated multi-objective learning
(FMOL) attempts to import multi-objective optimisation (MOO) into FL. However,
it merely delivers task-wise Pareto-stationary points, leaving client fairness
to chance. In this paper, we introduce Conically-Regularised FMOL (CR-FMOL),
the first federated MOO framework that enforces client-wise Pareto optimality
through a novel preference-cone constraint. After local federated
multi-gradient descent averaging (FMGDA) / federated stochastic multi-gradient
descent averaging (FSMGDA) steps, each client transmits its aggregated
task-loss vector as an implicit preference; the server then solves a
cone-constrained Pareto-MTL sub-problem centred at the uniform vector,
producing a descent direction that is Pareto-stationary for every client within
its cone. Experiments on non-IID benchmarks show that CR-FMOL enhances client
fairness, and although the early-stage performance is slightly inferior to
FedAvg, it is expected to achieve comparable accuracy given sufficient training
rounds.

Result: GCPO在多个推理基准测试中表现优于现有方法，包括GRPO。

Conclusion: GCPO通过整合因果结构显著提升了模型性能，为专业领域任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have broadened their
applicability across diverse tasks, yet specialized domains still require
targeted post training. Among existing methods, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) stands out for its efficiency, leveraging groupwise
relative rewards while avoiding costly value function learning. However, GRPO
treats candidate responses as independent, overlooking semantic interactions
such as complementarity and contradiction. To address this challenge, we first
introduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) that reveals hidden dependencies
among candidate responses induced by conditioning on a final integrated output
forming a collider structure. Then, our causal analysis leads to two insights:
(1) projecting responses onto a causally informed subspace improves prediction
quality, and (2) this projection yields a better baseline than query only
conditioning. Building on these insights, we propose Group Causal Policy
Optimization (GCPO), which integrates causal structure into optimization
through two key components: a causally informed reward adjustment and a novel
KL regularization term that aligns the policy with a causally projected
reference distribution. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that
GCPO consistently surpasses existing methods, including GRPO across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: MLES是一种可扩展、可解释的控制策略发现方法，有望成为下一代领先技术。

Abstract: Interpretability and high performance are essential goals in designing
control policies, particularly for safety-critical tasks. Deep reinforcement
learning has greatly enhanced performance, yet its inherent lack of
interpretability often undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This
work addresses these dual challenges by introducing a novel approach for
programmatic policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted
Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as
policy generators, combining them with evolutionary mechanisms for automatic
policy optimization. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis
within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and
facilitate targeted improvements, enhancing the efficiency of policy discovery
and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results show that
MLES achieves policy discovery capabilities and efficiency comparable to
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two control tasks, while offering
transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This paradigm
overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates
knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various control tasks.
MLES shows promise as a leading approach for the next generation of

*Vincent Jeanselme,Brian Tom,Jessica Barrett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了将竞争风险误分类为截尾数据对生存估计的偏差影响，量化了误差并分析了其对预测性能和算法公平性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的时间到事件预测对决策至关重要，但竞争风险常被误处理为截尾数据，导致生存估计偏差和加剧不公平。

Method: 开发了一个框架来量化因误分类竞争风险为截尾数据而产生的误差，并分析了其对预测性能和算法公平性的影响。

Result: 实证分析表明，忽略竞争风险会高估风险并加剧群体间的不公平，尤其对高风险个体影响更大。

Conclusion: 生存模型必须考虑竞争风险以提高准确性、减少评估偏差并改善决策公平性。

Abstract: Accurate time-to-event prediction is integral to decision-making, informing
medical guidelines, hiring decisions, and resource allocation. Survival
analysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts
for patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study
period, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events
that prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks
are often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a
limited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates
why treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in
survival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,
critically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of
misclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in
survival estimates. Specifically, we develop a framework to estimate this error
and demonstrate the associated implications for predictive performance and
algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, we examine how differing risk profiles
across demographic groups lead to group-specific errors, potentially
exacerbating existing disparities. Our findings, supported by an empirical
analysis of cardiovascular management, demonstrate that ignoring competing
risks disproportionately impacts the individuals most at risk of these events,
potentially accentuating inequity. By quantifying the error and highlighting
the fairness implications of the common practice of considering competing risks
as censoring, our work provides a critical insight into the development of
survival models: practitioners must account for competing risks to improve
accuracy, reduce disparities in risk assessment, and better inform downstream
decisions.

*Zuyuan Zhang,Arnob Ghosh,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新方法（CVaR-MCTS和W-MCTS）来解决MCTS中极端高风险结果的尾部风险问题，并提供了严格的尾部安全保障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCTS仅考虑期望回报，无法应对高风险决策的潜在极端后果，现有方法也缺乏尾部风险控制。

Method: 1. CVaR-MCTS：嵌入条件风险价值（CVaR）以控制尾部风险；2. W-MCTS：引入Wasserstein模糊集解决尾部风险估计偏差。

Result: 实验表明，两种方法在模拟环境中优于基线，实现了稳健的尾部风险控制和更高的奖励与稳定性。

Conclusion: CVaR-MCTS和W-MCTS为MCTS提供了尾部安全保障，解决了高风险场景中的尾部风险问题。

Abstract: Making decisions with respect to just the expected returns in Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) cannot account for the potential range of high-risk, adverse
outcomes associated with a decision. To this end, safety-aware MCTS often
consider some constrained variants -- by introducing some form of mean risk
measures or hard cost thresholds. These approaches fail to provide rigorous
tail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted
as tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake
scenarios. This paper addresses the problem by developing two novel solutions.
We first propose CVaR-MCTS, which embeds a coherent tail risk measure,
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), into MCTS. Our CVaR-MCTS with parameter
$\alpha$ achieves explicit tail-risk control over the expected loss in the
"worst $(1-\alpha)\%$ scenarios." Second, we further address the estimation
bias of tail-risk due to limited samples. We propose Wasserstein-MCTS (or
W-MCTS) by introducing a first-order Wasserstein ambiguity set
$\mathcal{P}_{\varepsilon_{s}}(s,a)$ with radius $\varepsilon_{s}$ to
characterize the uncertainty in tail-risk estimates. We prove PAC tail-safety
guarantees for both CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS and establish their regret.
Evaluations on diverse simulated environments demonstrate that our proposed
methods outperform existing baselines, effectively achieving robust tail-risk
guarantees with improved rewards and stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EnergyPatchTST是一种基于Patch Time Series Transformer的能源时间序列预测方法，通过多尺度特征提取、概率预测框架、未来变量整合及预训练微调策略，显著提升了预测精度和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在多尺度时间动态和真实数据不规则性方面存在局限，需要更准确的能源时间序列预测方法以支持电力规划和分配。

Method: 提出EnergyPatchTST，包含多尺度特征提取、蒙特卡洛消除的概率预测框架、未来已知变量整合路径及预训练微调策略。

Result: 在常见能源数据集上，预测误差降低7-12%，并提供可靠的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: EnergyPatchTST在能源时间序列预测中表现优异，为领域内预测提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable energy time series prediction is of great significance
for power generation planning and allocation. At present, deep learning time
series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale
time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the
existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension
of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting.
The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature
extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2)
probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo
elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as
temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples
to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments
on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other
commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable
uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for
time series prediction in the energy field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络内部表征的形成机制尚不明确，研究任务难度如何影响其表征拓扑和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用五种探针方法（剪枝、二值化、噪声注入、符号翻转和二分网络随机化）分析MLP在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上的表现。

Result: 二值化权重使困难任务模型准确率骤降，而简单任务模型保持鲁棒；噪声注入可提升准确率；仅保留符号结构即可维持高准确率。

Conclusion: 任务复杂度可通过全精度与二值化/随机化网络的性能差距衡量，符号二分拓扑在表征学习中起关键作用，为模型压缩和可解释性提供策略。

Abstract: Neural networks excel across a wide range of tasks, yet remain black boxes.
In particular, how their internal representations are shaped by the complexity
of the input data and the problems they solve remains obscure. In this work, we
introduce a suite of five data-agnostic probes-pruning, binarization, noise
injection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization-to quantify how
task difficulty influences the topology and robustness of representations in
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs are represented as signed, weighted
bipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard
classification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that
binarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas
easy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges
in binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance.
Moreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a
stochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude
weights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight
magnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high
accuracy. These phenomena define a model- and modality-agnostic measure of task
complexity: the performance gap between full-precision and binarized or
shuffled neural network performance. Our findings highlight the crucial role of
signed bipartite topology in learned representations and suggest practical
strategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task
complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统评估常依赖真实数据，但缺乏真实数据时难以评估。研究旨在开发一种无需真实数据的评估机制，利用游戏抵抗性确保评估质量。

Method: 通过数据处理不等式证明游戏抵抗性与输出质量的关系，提出f-互信息作为唯一游戏抵抗机制，并比较了不同信息度量（如总变差距离）的可行性。

Result: 在10个领域（如翻译、同行评审）中，信息论机制能完美区分忠实与策略性代理，且对抗操纵的鲁棒性比现有方法高10-100倍。

Conclusion: 研究证明了信息论机制在无需真实数据评估中的有效性，并揭示了压缩比对性能的影响，为未来AI评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: We develop mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth by
exploiting a connection between gaming resistance and output quality. The data
processing inequality ensures post-hoc attempts to game a metric degrades both
information content and task performance. We prove that f-mutual information
measures are the unique gaming resistant mechanisms under natural conditions,
with the overseer acting as an agent. While Shannon mutual information faces
exponential sample complexity, bounded measures like total variation distance
remain tractable. Empirically, across ten domains from translation to peer
review, all information-theoretic mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination (d
> 0.5) between faithful and strategic agents. In contrast, LLM judges exhibit
systematic evaluation inversion, preferring fabricated content over accurate
summaries. Our mechanisms show 10-100x better robustness to adversarial
manipulation than current practices. We also find performance follows an
inverted-U curve with compression ratio, peaking at 10:1 where agent responses
exhibit optimal information diversity (3 effective dimensions), giving a
bias-variance perspective on when our approach is expected to be most
effective.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多任务循环神经网络，联合建模观察间隔时间和缺失过程，以提高临床预测模型的性能和可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床存在（clinical presence）影响观察结果，但传统预测模型常忽略这一点，导致性能和可迁移性受限。

Method: 使用多任务循环神经网络，同时建模观察间隔时间、缺失过程和生存结局。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上的死亡率预测任务中，该方法优于未考虑观察过程的先进模型。

Conclusion: 利用临床存在可以提升预测模型的性能和可迁移性。

Abstract: Electronic health records arise from the complex interaction between patients
and the healthcare system. This observation process of interactions, referred
to as clinical presence, often impacts observed outcomes. When using electronic
health records to develop clinical prediction models, it is standard practice
to overlook clinical presence, impacting performance and limiting the
transportability of models when this interaction evolves. We propose a
multi-task recurrent neural network that jointly models the inter-observation
time and the missingness processes characterising this interaction in parallel
to the survival outcome of interest. Our work formalises the concept of
clinical presence shift when the prediction model is deployed in new settings
(e.g. different hospitals, regions or countries), and we theoretically justify
why the proposed joint modelling can improve transportability under changes in
clinical presence. We demonstrate, in a real-world mortality prediction task in
the MIMIC-III dataset, how the proposed strategy improves performance and
transportability compared to state-of-the-art prediction models that do not
incorporate the observation process. These results emphasise the importance of
leveraging clinical presence to improve performance and create more
transportable clinical prediction models.

Motivation: 多模态EHR数据能提供更丰富的患者健康信息，但整合这些数据用于临床预测建模仍具挑战性。

Result: 在三种预测任务中，MoMA表现优于现有方法，展示了其准确性和灵活性。

Conclusion: MoMA为多模态EHR数据的临床预测提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary
insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However,
effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction
modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We
introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed
to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction
tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents
("specialist agents") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images
and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries,
together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM ("aggregator agent")
to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM
("predictor agent") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three
prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations
and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种无参数的多视图聚类算法AMVFCM-U和AAMVFCM-U，通过熵正则化和信噪比特征加权实现自适应跨视图共识，显著提升了计算效率和降维效果。


<details>

Motivation: 解决多视图聚类中高维特征和无关信息的问题，避免传统方法需要手动调参和缺乏跨视图整合机制的缺陷。

Method: 引入熵正则化替代模糊化参数，使用信噪比特征加权和双层次熵项自动平衡视图和特征的贡献，AAMVFCM-U还通过自适应阈值实现层次降维。

Result: 在五个基准测试中优于15种先进方法，AAMVFCM-U计算效率提升97%，降维至原始尺寸的0.45%，并能自动识别关键视图组合。

Conclusion: 提出的算法为多视图聚类提供了高效、自适应的解决方案，显著提升了性能和实用性。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering faces critical challenges in automatically discovering
patterns across heterogeneous data while managing high-dimensional features and
eliminating irrelevant information. Traditional approaches suffer from manual
parameter tuning and lack principled cross-view integration mechanisms. This
work introduces two complementary algorithms: AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U, providing
a unified parameter-free framework. Our approach replaces fuzzification
parameters with entropy regularization terms that enforce adaptive cross-view
consensus. The core innovation employs signal-to-noise ratio based
regularization ($\delta_j^h = \frac{\bar{x}_j^h}{(\sigma_j^h)^2}$) for
principled feature weighting with convergence guarantees, coupled with
dual-level entropy terms that automatically balance view and feature
contributions. AAMVFCM-U extends this with hierarchical dimensionality
reduction operating at feature and view levels through adaptive thresholding
($\theta^{h^{(t)}} = \frac{d_h^{(t)}}{n}$). Evaluation across five diverse
benchmarks demonstrates superiority over 15 state-of-the-art methods. AAMVFCM-U
achieves up to 97% computational efficiency gains, reduces dimensionality to
0.45% of original size, and automatically identifies critical view combinations
for optimal pattern discovery.

Motivation: 随着PCs的表达能力增强，过拟合问题在数据有限时变得显著，论文从对数似然景观的角度分析了这一问题，并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过计算对数似然的Hessian矩阵迹（一种尖锐度代理），设计了一种高效的Hessian迹正则化方法，适用于EM和梯度优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能引导PCs收敛到更平坦的极小值，显著提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: Hessian迹正则化是一种有效的方法，能够改善PCs的训练效果，尤其在数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a class of generative models that allow
exact and tractable inference for a wide range of queries. While recent
developments have enabled the learning of deep and expressive PCs, this
increased capacity can often lead to overfitting, especially when data is
limited. We analyze PC overfitting from a log-likelihood-landscape perspective
and show that it is often caused by convergence to sharp optima that generalize
poorly. Inspired by sharpness aware minimization in neural networks, we propose
a Hessian-based regularizer for training PCs. As a key contribution, we show
that the trace of the Hessian of the log-likelihood-a sharpness proxy that is
typically intractable in deep neural networks-can be computed efficiently for
PCs. Minimizing this Hessian trace induces a gradient-norm-based regularizer
that yields simple closed-form parameter updates for EM, and integrates
seamlessly with gradient based learning methods. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently guides PCs toward
flatter minima, improves generalization performance.

Conclusion: 本文填补了无监督VLM适应领域的空白，为未来研究提供了系统框架和资源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often
remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios
without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving
data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised
adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing
interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey
dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a
comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based
on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing
approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised
Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data),
and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we
analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each
paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.
Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications
and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research. An
actively maintained repository of relevant literature is available at

TL;DR: X-VFL是一种新的垂直联邦学习框架，解决了数据样本不对齐和缺失特征的问题，并支持本地独立推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决垂直联邦学习中数据样本不对齐和缺失特征的挑战，以及无法本地独立推理的问题。

Method: 设计了两个模块：Cross Completion (XCom) 用于特征补全，Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align) 用于决策子空间对齐。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MIMIC-III数据集上分别实现了15%和43%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: X-VFL在部分缺失特征和本地独立推理场景中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by
integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However,
VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly
aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)
the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all
clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).
To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to
deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to
support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In
particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and
Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing
features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other
clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features
across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally
independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems
for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type
algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly
outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on
the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III
dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of
X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and
locally independent inference.

Motivation: 当前QAT研究仅关注最小化量化误差，未尝试突破全精度模型的性能上限。Fairy±i旨在打破这一限制，提升低比特量化模型的准确性。

Result: Fairy±i在PPL和下游任务中超越了现有2位量化方法的性能上限，同时保持存储和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为极低比特约束下构建高精度实用LLMs开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training
loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely
recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT
research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,
where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No
existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this
ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model),
and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$,
the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically,
our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to
boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity
$\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically
optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a
zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only
additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$
outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of
both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute
efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and
practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for
medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating
interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we
investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical
phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable
clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In
addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a
synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and
iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs,
coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably
accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods
while requiring significantly fewer training examples.

Motivation: 现有的知识图谱嵌入方法依赖负采样，但主流库仅支持基础策略，缺乏高级解决方案。

Method: 开发了一个PyKEEN扩展，支持静态和动态负采样策略，并保持与现有工作流的兼容性。

Result: 通过实证研究展示了扩展对嵌入模型性能的提升，并为设计更有效策略提供了见解。

Conclusion: 该扩展不仅增强了PyKEEN的功能，还简化了嵌入方法的开发和定制。

Abstract: Embedding methods have become popular due to their scalability on link
prediction and/or triple classification tasks on Knowledge Graphs. Embedding
models are trained relying on both positive and negative samples of triples.
However, in the absence of negative assertions, these must be usually
artificially generated using various negative sampling strategies, ranging from
random corruption to more sophisticated techniques which have an impact on the
overall performance. Most of the popular libraries for knowledge graph
embedding, support only basic such strategies and lack advanced solutions. To
address this gap, we deliver an extension for the popular KGE framework PyKEEN
that integrates a suite of several advanced negative samplers (including both
static and dynamic corruption strategies), within a consistent modular
architecture, to generate meaningful negative samples, while remaining
compatible with existing PyKEEN -based workflows and pipelines. The developed
extension not only enhancesPyKEEN itself but also allows for easier and
comprehensive development of embedding methods and/or for their customization.
As a proof of concept, we present a comprehensive empirical study of the
developed extensions and their impact on the performance (link prediction
tasks) of different embedding methods, which also provides useful insights for
the design of more effective strategies

Abstract: The exponential growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the
emergence of substantial security concerns, with IoT networks becoming the
primary target for cyberattacks. This study examines the potential of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to conventional machine
learning models for intrusion detection in IoT networks. The study demonstrates
that KANs, which employ learnable activation functions, outperform traditional
MLPs and achieve competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models such
as Random Forest and XGBoost, while offering superior interpretability for
intrusion detection in IoT networks.

Abstract: Backdoor injection attacks are a threat to machine learning models that are
trained on large data collected from untrusted sources; these attacks enable
attackers to inject malicious behavior into the model that can be triggered by
specially crafted inputs. Prior work has established bounds on the success of
backdoor attacks and their impact on the benign learning task, however, an open
question is what amount of poison data is needed for a successful backdoor
attack. Typical attacks either use few samples, but need much information about
the data points or need to poison many data points.
  In this paper, we formulate the one-poison hypothesis: An adversary with one
poison sample and limited background knowledge can inject a backdoor with zero
backdooring-error and without significantly impacting the benign learning task
performance. Moreover, we prove the one-poison hypothesis for linear regression
and linear classification. For adversaries that utilize a direction that is
unused by the benign data distribution for the poison sample, we show that the
resulting model is functionally equivalent to a model where the poison was
excluded from training. We build on prior work on statistical backdoor learning
to show that in all other cases, the impact on the benign learning task is
still limited. We also validate our theoretical results experimentally with
realistic benchmark data sets.

Conclusion: 数据为中心的调整对提升多模态大语言模型的强化学习训练效率至关重要。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training
paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training
inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where
most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where
the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over
time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term
learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple
yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically
restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1)
Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with
large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based
Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through
informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks
show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with
minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric
adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior,
especially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous
vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often
lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer
improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,
limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design
trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to
generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose
two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population
diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and
improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo
outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and
notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to
an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the
automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction
heuristics. We release our source code to facilitate future research at

Result: DFT在多个基准测试和基础模型上显著优于标准SFT，并展示了在离线强化学习中的竞争力。

Conclusion: DFT通过理论洞察和实践改进，显著提升了SFT的性能，是一种简单有效的替代方案。

Abstract: We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited
generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical
analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic
reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of
model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing
gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function
with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change
significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks
and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally,
our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an
effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and
practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be

*Yuxuan Tao,Adel Javanmard*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的高维控制变量选择私有化框架，通过高斯Johnson-Lindenstrauss变换（JLT）实现差分隐私下的FDR控制，优于传统噪声注入方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私机制（如拉普拉斯或高斯噪声注入）破坏了Model-X knockoff程序的核心可交换性条件，无法在隐私约束下保证FDR控制。

Method: 利用高斯JLT对数据knockoff矩阵进行私有化，保留协变量关系的近似等距性，同时实现(ε,δ)-差分隐私。

Result: 理论分析了FDR和统计功效，表明JLT的降维比、信噪比、隐私参数等因素影响隐私与功效的权衡，并在严格隐私预算下保持统计功效。

Conclusion: 该框架结合了knockoff的FDR控制和隐私数据发布，适用于敏感领域的高维变量选择，且结构隐私保护优于传统噪声机制。

Abstract: We introduce a novel privatization framework for high-dimensional controlled
variable selection. Our framework enables rigorous False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control under differential privacy constraints. While the Model-X knockoff
procedure provides FDR guarantees by constructing provably exchangeable
``negative control" features, existing privacy mechanisms like Laplace or
Gaussian noise injection disrupt its core exchangeability conditions. Our key
innovation lies in privatizing the data knockoff matrix through the Gaussian
Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transformation (JLT), a dimension reduction technique
that simultaneously preserves covariate relationships through approximate
isometry for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy.
  We theoretically characterize both FDR and the power of the proposed private
variable selection procedure, in an asymptotic regime. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the role of different factors, such as the JLT's dimension
reduction ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, differential privacy parameters, sample
size and feature dimension, in shaping the privacy-power trade-off. Our
analysis is based on a novel `debiasing technique' for high-dimensional private
knockoff procedure. We further establish sufficient conditions under which the
power of the proposed procedure converges to one. This work bridges two
critical paradigms -- knockoff-based FDR control and private data release --
enabling reliable variable selection in sensitive domains. Our analysis
demonstrates that structural privacy preservation through random projections
outperforms the classical noise addition mechanism, maintaining statistical
power even under strict privacy budgets.

Abstract: With the development of big data and machine learning, privacy concerns have
become increasingly critical, especially when handling heterogeneous datasets
containing sensitive personal information. Differential privacy provides a
rigorous framework for safeguarding individual privacy while enabling
meaningful statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose a differentially
private quantile regression method for high-dimensional data in a distributed
setting. Quantile regression is a powerful and robust tool for modeling the
relationships between the covariates and responses in the presence of outliers
or heavy-tailed distributions. To address the computational challenges due to
the non-smoothness of the quantile loss function, we introduce a Newton-type
transformation that reformulates the quantile regression task into an ordinary
least squares problem. Building on this, we develop a differentially private
estimation algorithm with iterative updates, ensuring both near-optimal
statistical accuracy and formal privacy guarantees. For inference, we further
propose a differentially private debiased estimator, which enables valid
confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing. Additionally, we
propose a communication-efficient and differentially private bootstrap for
simultaneous hypothesis testing in high-dimensional quantile regression,
suitable for distributed settings with both small and abundant local data.
Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our
methods in practical scenarios.

Abstract: In functional data analysis, binary classification with one functional
covariate has been extensively studied. We aim to fill in the gap of
considering multivariate functional covariates in classification. In
particular, we propose an $L_1$-regularized functional support vector machine
for binary classification. An accompanying algorithm is developed to fit the
classifier. By imposing an $L_1$ penalty, the algorithm enables us to identify
relevant functional covariates of the binary response. Numerical results from
simulations and one real-world application demonstrate that the proposed
classifier enjoys good performance in both prediction and feature selection.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the bias and high-order error bounds of the Linear
Stochastic Approximation (LSA) algorithm with Polyak-Ruppert (PR) averaging
under Markovian noise. We focus on the version of the algorithm with constant
step size $\alpha$ and propose a novel decomposition of the bias via a
linearization technique. We analyze the structure of the bias and show that the
leading-order term is linear in $\alpha$ and cannot be eliminated by PR
averaging. To address this, we apply the Richardson-Romberg (RR) extrapolation
procedure, which effectively cancels the leading bias term. We derive
high-order moment bounds for the RR iterates and show that the leading error
term aligns with the asymptotically optimal covariance matrix of the vanilla
averaged LSA iterates.
