While Transformer-based models utilizing channel-independence (CI)\nstrategies have demonstrated strong performance in various time series tasks,\nthey often overlook the inter-channel correlations that are critical in\nmultivariate EEG signals. This omission can lead to information degradation and\nreduced prediction accuracy, particularly in complex tasks such as neurological\noutcome prediction. To address these challenges, we propose Biaxialformer,\ncharacterized by a meticulously engineered two-stage attention-based framework.\nThis model independently captures both sequence-specific (temporal) and\nchannel-specific (spatial) EEG information, promoting synergy and mutual\nreinforcement across channels without sacrificing CI. By employing joint\nlearning of positional encodings, Biaxialformer preserves both temporal and\nspatial relationships in EEG data, mitigating the interchannel correlation\nforgetting problem common in traditional CI models. Additionally, a\ntokenization module with variable receptive fields balance the extraction of\nfine-grained, localized features and broader temporal dependencies. To enhance\nspatial feature extraction, we leverage bipolar EEG signals, which capture\ninter-hemispheric brain interactions, a critical but often overlooked aspect in\nEEG analysis.

The Rashomon Effect\nimplies that data modelers would not be able to determine which model generated\nthe data.

In the first\nstage, a Koopman-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (K-GCN) is developed to\nembed the high-dimensional dynamics distributed on spatially irregular domains\ninto a latent space where the evolution of system states is approximately\nlinear. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, this stage enhances the temporal\nconsistency during the latent learning. In the second stage, a Transformer\nmodule is employed to model the temporal progression within the Koopman-encoded\nlatent space. Through the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer captures\nlong-range temporal dependencies, enabling accurate forecasting over extended\nhorizons. We evaluate TK-GCN in spatiotemporal cardiac dynamics forecasting and\nbenchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art baselines.\nExperimental results and ablation studies show that TK-GCN consistently\ndelivers superior predictive accuracy across a range of forecast horizons,\ndemonstrating its capability to effectively model complex spatial structures\nand nonlinear temporal dynamics."}

The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the\nthird chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient\nalgorithms.\n  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and\nextensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent\nactions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an\nagent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a\ncognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also\naddresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization\nbehavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.\n  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine\nif an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer\n(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The\nchapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing\nthe continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random\nhorizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a\nBayes-optimal sequential detector.

This method aims to track time-varying utility functions\ngiven noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms\npresented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient\nalgorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic\ngradient algorithm is in operation."}

Although reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF) is the dominant approach, it has high\ncomputational costs, memory requirements, and training instability,\nparticularly when scaling to larger models. This paper introduces ESSA\n(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses\nEvolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for\ngradient computation. ES is well-suited for LLM alignment due to its favorable\nproperties, such as high parallelizability, memory efficiency, robustness to\nsparse rewards, and fewer data samples required for convergence, especially\nwhen starting from a strong pre-trained policy. Moreover, ES eliminates the\nneed for extensive hyperparameter tuning, making the alignment process simpler\nand more stable. Although ES excels in low-dimensional optimization, it poses a\nchallenge when applied to high-dimensional LLMs. To address this challenge, we\npropose a parameter-efficient architectural modification that reduces the\ndimensionality of optimization through low-rank adaptation. We evaluated our\napproach on mathematical reasoning tasks with verifiable accuracy-based\nmetrics, demonstrating that ESSA converges faster and is more data efficient\nthan gradient-based methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Re-initializing the network can be a solution, but it\nresults in the loss of learned information, leading to performance drops. In\nthis paper, we propose Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR), a novel approach that\nprevents unbounded weight growth without losing information. SWR recovers the\nplasticity of the network by simply scaling down the weight at each step of the\nlearning process. We theoretically prove that SWR bounds weight magnitude and\nbalances weight magnitude between layers. Our experiment shows that SWR\nimproves performance on warm-start learning, continual learning, and\nsingle-task learning setups on standard image classification benchmarks."}

In this paper, we propose\nNeighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer\nframework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a\nself-teaching paradigm.

The estimation of particle size distributions is\ncommonly formulated as a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, an\nill-posed inverse problem characterized by instability due to measurement noise\nand limited data. To address this, we use a Gaussian process prior to\nregularize the solution and integrate a normalization constraint into the\nGaussian process via two approaches: by constraining the Gaussian process using\na pseudo-measurement and by using Lagrange multipliers in the equivalent\noptimization problem.

I provide a modern perspective on these approaches. One of Breiman's\nkey arguments against data models is the ''Rashomon Effect,'' which is the\nexistence of many different-but-equally-good models. The Rashomon Effect\nimplies that data modelers would not be able to determine which model generated\nthe data. Conversely, one of his core advantages in favor of data models is\nsimplicity, as he claimed there exists an ''Occam Dilemma,'' i.e., an\naccuracy-simplicity tradeoff. After 25 years of powerful computers, it has\nbecome clear that this claim is not generally true, in that algorithmic models\ndo not need to be complex to be accurate; however, there are nuances that help\nexplain Breiman's logic, specifically, that by ''simple,'' he appears to\nconsider only linear models or unoptimized decision trees. Interestingly, the\nRashomon Effect is a key tool in proving the nullification of the Occam\nDilemma. To his credit though, Breiman did not have the benefit of modern\ncomputers, with which my observations are much easier to make.\n  Breiman's goal for interpretability was somewhat intertwined with causality:\nsimpler models can help reveal which variables have a causal relationship with\nthe outcome. However, I argue that causality can be investigated without the\nuse of single models, whether or not they are simple. Interpretability is\nuseful in its own right, and I think Breiman knew that too.\n  Technically, my modern perspective does not belong to either of Breiman's Two\nCultures, but shares the goals of both of them - causality, simplicity,\naccuracy - and shows that these goals can be accomplished in other ways,\nwithout the limitations Breiman was concerned about."}
