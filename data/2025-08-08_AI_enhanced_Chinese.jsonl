We compare our method with MUSIC and ESPRIT,\nwhich are classical subspace-based algorithms widely used for estimating the\nparameters of exponential signals. In the univariate case, the method\noutperforms MUSIC and ESPRIT under low signal-to-noise ratios. For the\nmultivariate case, we develop a coordinate-wise projection and registration\napproach that achieves high recovery accuracy using significantly fewer samples\nthan other methods.\n  The second method focuses on separating linear chirp components from\ntime-localized signal segments. A variant of the Signal Separation Operator\n(SSO) is constructed using a localized kernel. Instantaneous frequency\nestimates are obtained via FFT-based filtering, then clustered and fitted with\npiecewise linear regression. The method operates without prior knowledge of the\nnumber of components and is shown to recover intersecting and discontinuous\nchirps at SNR levels as low as -30 dB.\n  Both methods share an idea based on localized kernels and efficient FFT-based\nimplementation, and neither requires subspace decomposition or sparsity\nregularization.

Differential privacy provides a\nrigorous framework for safeguarding individual privacy while enabling\nmeaningful statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose a differentially\nprivate quantile regression method for high-dimensional data in a distributed\nsetting. Quantile regression is a powerful and robust tool for modeling the\nrelationships between the covariates and responses in the presence of outliers\nor heavy-tailed distributions. To address the computational challenges due to\nthe non-smoothness of the quantile loss function, we introduce a Newton-type\ntransformation that reformulates the quantile regression task into an ordinary\nleast squares problem. Building on this, we develop a differentially private\nestimation algorithm with iterative updates, ensuring both near-optimal\nstatistical accuracy and formal privacy guarantees. For inference, we further\npropose a differentially private debiased estimator, which enables valid\nconfidence interval construction and hypothesis testing. Additionally, we\npropose a communication-efficient and differentially private bootstrap for\nsimultaneous hypothesis testing in high-dimensional quantile regression,\nsuitable for distributed settings with both small and abundant local data.\nExtensive simulations demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our\nmethods in practical scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u725b\u987f\u578b\u53d8\u6362\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u6570\u636e\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u3002\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2a\u4f53\u9690\u79c1\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u725b\u987f\u578b\u53d8\u6362\u5c06\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u666e\u901a\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u53bb\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Specifically, EB is\nutilized to characterize the static properties of the electromagnetic\nenvironment, which is extracted from the digital twin map, serving as\nenvironmental information prior to the prediction task. Then, we fuse EB with\nreal-time estimated local CSI to predict the entire spatial-frequency domain\nchannel for both the present and future time instances.

We present a comprehensive theoretical and\nempirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a\nmathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between\nadaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the\nformalization of selection sensitivity ($\\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures\nhow adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We\nprove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two\nindependent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than\na threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while\ndecreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the\nMultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform\nsampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical\nrelationship holds precisely in practice.

This challenge is\nparticularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where\nlabeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference\nlearning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised\npre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive\ninitial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a\ncold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the\nmodel is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a\nsimulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse\ndatasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career\nsuccess rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our\ncold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin\nfrom a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled\npairs.

Hierarchical Federated\nLearning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks\nacross intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and\nrobustness against single points of failure.

Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which\npredict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal\ndependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon.\nAutoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from\nerror accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the\nlong-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues,\nwe introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network\n(PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed\nor hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate\nlong-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting\nfuture states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current\nstate, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the\nsolution in time.

Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to\naddress this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled\ntrial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the\nobserved data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,\ninverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the\npropensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores\nhave high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately\ndegrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect\nestimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor\nWeighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the\ndeconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW\nprioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly\nconfounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.\nOur approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate\nbalance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to\nmulti-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the\nestimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.\nThrough extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,\nwe demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,\nin both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5DFW\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u5b50\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982IPW\uff09\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u65f6\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u5904\u7406\u7ec4\u95f4\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982IPW\uff09\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeconfounding Factor Weighting (DFW)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53bb\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u5b50\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u4f4e\u6df7\u6742\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u6df7\u6742\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDFW\u5728\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982IPW\u548cCBPS\uff09\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u6709\u754c\u4e14\u65b9\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "DFW\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u548c\u591a\u5904\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

This design enables continuous-time modeling\nand dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize\nacross all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the\nforecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which\nrequire training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns\nat each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input\nscale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved\nefficiency.

Among existing methods, Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) stands out for its efficiency, leveraging groupwise\nrelative rewards while avoiding costly value function learning. However, GRPO\ntreats candidate responses as independent, overlooking semantic interactions\nsuch as complementarity and contradiction. To address this challenge, we first\nintroduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) that reveals hidden dependencies\namong candidate responses induced by conditioning on a final integrated output\nforming a collider structure.

Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight\nmagnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high\naccuracy.

Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often\nlack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer\nimproved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,\nlimited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a\nframework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design\ntrajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to\ngenerate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose\ntwo key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population\ndiversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and\nimprove alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo\noutperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and\nnotably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to\nan unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the\nautomated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction\nheuristics.
