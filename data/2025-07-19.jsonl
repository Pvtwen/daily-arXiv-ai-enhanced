Towards this, we analytically show that the detected data can be\nused as a pilot and that the channel estimate obtained from the detected data\ncan enable further detection enabling the \"differential\" aspect of the\ncommunication. Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD\nchannel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data\nsymbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next\ninstant and propagate this forward. The advantages are two fold.

Considering that with a\nmassive UCA, its polar angles of array sensors can approximately represent\nazimuth angles over $360^{\\circ}$ using angle quantization, a simple\ntwo-dimensional DOA estimation method for a single source is proposed.

Due to the highly non-convex nature of the loss\nfunction in deep learning, existing optimization algorithms often converge to\nsuboptimal local minima or suffer from gradient explosion or vanishing,\nresulting in poor performance. To address these issues, we introduce auxiliary\nvariables to separate the layers of deep neural networks. Specifically, the\noutput and its derivatives of each layer are represented by auxiliary\nvariables, effectively decomposing the deep architecture into a series of\nshallow architectures. New loss functions with auxiliary variables are\nestablished, in which only variables from two neighboring layers are coupled.\nCorresponding algorithms based on alternating directions are developed, where\nmany variables can be updated optimally in closed forms. Moreover, we provide\ntheoretical analyses demonstrating the consistency between the LySep model and\nthe original deep model. High-dimensional numerical results validate our theory\nand demonstrate the advantages of LySep in minimizing loss and reducing\nsolution error."}

Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility\nfor large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC\nacceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to\nmaintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end\napplications. This paper introduces \\textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware\nco-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC\nacceleration. Firstly, \\textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity\nthrough an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd\ndimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and\nmemory parameters. Secondly, \\textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware\naccelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels\nwith a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units,\nreconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular\naccess. Thirdly, the core of \\textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel\nsampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the\nend-to-end case study, \\textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\\times$,\n$1.4\\times$, $2.0\\times$, $84.2\\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU\nand state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator. Evaluated on various representative MCMC\nworkloads, this work demonstrates and exploits the feasibility of general\nhardware acceleration to popularize MCMC-based solutions in diverse application\ndomains."}

However, the existing\nrepresentation learning mainly induced from model learning aspects, misaligning\nwith our RL tasks. This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a\nnovel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which\naligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of\npossible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key\ninsight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the\nzero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by\nthe Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance\nstructure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded\nobjective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this\nBellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to\nexisting algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable\nstructured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics,\nand improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration\nand long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to\npowerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral\nBellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning\nmore powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based\nreinforcement learning."}
