Our approach addresses the challenge of detecting system-wide\nbehavioral shifts in complex, dynamic environments where the number and\nbehavior of individual entities may be uncertain or evolve. We introduce the\nconcept of Individual Deviation from Normality (IDfN), computed via a\nreconstruction-error-based autoencoder trained on normal behavior. We aggregate\nthese individual deviations using mean, variance, and Kernel Density Estimates\n(KDE) to yield a System-Wide Anomaly Score (SWAS). To detect persistent or\nabrupt changes, we apply statistical deviation metrics and the Cumulative Sum\n(CUSUM) technique to these scores. Our unsupervised approach eliminates the\nneed for labeled data or feature extraction, enabling real-time operation on\nstreaming input. Evaluations on both synthetic datasets and crowd simulations,\nexplicitly designed for anomaly detection in group behaviors, demonstrate that\nour method accurately detects significant system-level changes, offering a\nscalable and privacy-preserving solution for monitoring complex multi-agent\nsystems.

Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a\nprominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic\napproach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection\nbetween PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its\nextensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in\na Euclidean coordinate system. However, in many neuroscience applications, data\nmay be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than\nlying in the Euclidean space. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal\nComponent Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction\nalgorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear\nmanifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition\nto the Euclidean coordinate system, a geometric coordinate system can be\nderived for the manifold to capture the deviations of data from the manifold\nand noise. We also derive a data-driven EM algorithm for learning the PGPCA\nmodel parameters. As such, PGPCA generalizes PPCA to better describe data\ndistributions by incorporating a nonlinear manifold geometry. In simulations\nand brain data analyses, we show that PGPCA can effectively model the data\ndistribution around various given manifolds and outperforms PPCA for such data.\nMoreover, PGPCA provides the capability to test whether the new geometric\ncoordinate system better describes the data than the Euclidean one. Finally,\nPGPCA can perform dimensionality reduction and learn the data distribution both\naround and on the manifold. These capabilities make PGPCA valuable for\nenhancing the efficacy of dimensionality reduction for analysis of\nhigh-dimensional data that exhibit noise and are distributed around a nonlinear\nmanifold."}

To meet the\ncommunity's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most\nof these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation\nand training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains\ncomputationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90%\nof total runtime.

Balancing datasets using the most popular methods of\ntraditional oversampling such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique\n(SMOTE) generally create simplistic synthetic samples that are not readily\napplicable to complex fraud patterns. Recent industry advances that include\nConditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) and Tabular\nVariational Autoencoders (TVAE) have demonstrated increased efficiency in\ntabular synthesis, yet all these models still exhibit issues with\nhigh-dimensional dependence modelling. Now we will present our hybrid approach\nwhere we use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a Transformer encoder\nblock to produce realistic fraudulent transactions samples. The GAN\narchitecture allows training realistic generators adversarial, and the\nTransformer allows the model to learn rich feature interactions by\nself-attention. Such a hybrid strategy overcomes the limitations of SMOTE,\nCTGAN, and TVAE by producing a variety of high-quality synthetic minority\nclasses samples. We test our algorithm on the publicly-available Credit Card\nFraud Detection dataset and compare it to conventional and generative\nresampling strategies with a variety of classifiers, such as Logistic\nRegression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM).

Maintaining grid\nstability under varying conditions is a complex task, and power flow simulators\nare commonly used to support operators by evaluating potential actions before\nimplementation. However, traditional physical solvers, while accurate, are\noften too slow for near real-time use. Machine learning models have emerged as\nfast surrogates, and to improve their adherence to physical laws (e.g.,\nKirchhoff's laws), they are often trained with embedded constraints which are\nalso known as physics-informed or hybrid models. This paper presents an\nablation study to demystify hybridization strategies, ranging from\nincorporating physical constraints as regularization terms or unsupervised\nlosses, and exploring model architectures from simple multilayer perceptrons to\nadvanced graph-based networks enabling the direct optimization of physics\nequations. Using our custom benchmarking pipeline for hybrid models called\nLIPS, we evaluate these models across four dimensions: accuracy, physical\ncompliance, industrial readiness, and out-of-distribution generalization. The\nresults highlight how integrating physical knowledge impacts performance across\nthese criteria. All the implementations are reproducible and provided in the\ncorresponding Github page."}

While prior work reports gains from lengthening CoTs and\nincreasing review (revisiting earlier steps) via appended *wait* tokens, recent\nstudies suggest that shorter thinking can outperform longer traces. We\ntherefore conduct a systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and\nscientific reasoning. Contrary to the \"longer-is-better\" narrative, we find\nthat both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with\n*lower* accuracy.\n  As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with\nprocess quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and\nidentify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of\nsteps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review\nratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two\ninterventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where\nFSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed\nbranches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed\nbranches bias subsequent reasoning. Taken together, these results characterize\neffective CoTs as those that *fail less* and support *structure-aware*\ntest-time scaling over indiscriminately generating long CoT."}

Unlike traditional settings that assume\nthe Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), interference allows an\nintervention/treatment on one unit to affect the outcomes of others.\nUnderstanding both direct and spillover effects is critical in fields such as\nepidemiology, political science, and economics. Causal inference on networks\nfaces two main challenges. First, causal effects are typically heterogeneous,\nvarying with unit features and local network structure. Second, connected units\noften exhibit dependence due to network homophily, creating confounding between\nstructural correlations and causal effects. In this paper, we propose a\ntwo-stage method to estimate heterogeneous direct and spillover effects on\nnetworks. The first stage uses graph neural networks to estimate nuisance\ncomponents that depend on the complex network topology. In the second stage, we\nadjust for network confounding using these estimates and infer causal effects\nthrough a novel attention-based interference model. Our approach balances\nexpressiveness and interpretability, enabling downstream tasks such as\nidentifying influential neighborhoods and recovering the sign of spillover\neffects.
