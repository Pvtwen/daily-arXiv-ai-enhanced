### [1] [A Multiscale Approach for Enhancing Weak Signal Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20828)
*Dixon Vimalajeewa,Ursula U. Muller,Brani Vidakovic*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双阈值检测系统，结合了随机共振和多尺度分析，显著提高了弱信号检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机共振技术基于单阈值检测器，仅限于时间无关信号，且需要大量噪声，可能扭曲复杂信号特征。

Method: 提出双阈值检测系统，集成两个单阈值检测器，在原始数据域和多尺度域（使用小波变换）进行评估。

Result: 在原始数据域中，双阈值检测器显著优于传统单阈值方法；在频域中性能进一步提升，需要更低噪声水平。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入稳健的弱信号识别方法，推进了基于随机共振的检测方法学，具有多学科应用潜力。

Abstract: Stochastic resonance (SR), a phenomenon originally introduced in climate
modeling, enhances signal detection by leveraging optimal noise levels within
non-linear systems. Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold
detectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often
large amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort
complex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study
explores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale
applications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be
analyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying
dynamics.
  We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two
single-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it
both in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated
and real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods.
  Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the
proposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection
compared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is
further improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while
outperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based
detection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal
identification, with potential applications in various disciplines.

### [2] [Is Repeater-Assisted Massive MIMO Compatible with Dynamic TDD?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20998)
*Martin Andersson,Anubhab Chowdhury,Erik G. Larsson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一个在动态TDD中继辅助大规模MIMO网络中联合优化中继增益放大和相移的框架，通过算法校准中继增益以增强期望信号并限制干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中继器作为具有放大和相移功能的有源散射体，能增强用户接收信号强度，但在动态TDD系统中会同时放大噪声和干扰信号，特别是由于上下行同时传输产生的交叉链路干扰，导致期望信号与干扰信号之间的权衡问题。

Method: 首先推导下行和上行频谱效率，然后开发了一个用于频谱效率最大化的中继增益优化算法。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的算法成功校准了中继增益，能够放大期望信号同时限制干扰。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决动态TDD中继辅助网络中期望信号与干扰信号之间的权衡问题，通过优化中继增益提升系统性能。

Abstract: We present a framework for joint amplification and phase shift optimization
of the repeater gain in dynamic time-division duplex (TDD) repeater-assisted
massive MIMO networks. Repeaters, being active scatterers with amplification
and phase shift, enhance the received signal strengths for users. However, they
inevitably also amplify undesired noise and interference signals, which become
particularly prominent in dynamic TDD systems due to the concurrent downlink
(DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions, introducing cross-link interference among
access points and users operating in opposite transmit directions. This causes
a non-trivial trade-off between amplification of desired and undesired signals.
To underpin the conditions under which such a trade-off can improve
performance, we first derive DL and UL spectral efficiencies (SEs), and then
develop a repeater gain optimization algorithm for SE maximization.
Numerically, we show that our proposed algorithm successfully calibrates the
repeater gain to amplify the desired signal while limiting the interference.

### [3] [6D Movable Holographic Surface Assisted Integrated Data and Energy Transfer: A Sensing Enhanced Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21137)
*Zhonglun Wang,Yizhe Zhao,Gangming Hu,Yali Zheng,Kun Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种6D可移动全息表面(6DMHS)集成数据与能量传输系统，通过三阶段协议协调6DMHS，有效服务IDET接收器，显著提升系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可重构全息表面(RHS)虽然能实现低成本大规模阵列，但其振幅控制的全息波束成形存在方向波动问题，难以充分利用RHS的空间增益。6D可移动天线(6DMA)为解决这一问题提供了潜在方案。

Method: 提出三阶段协议：上行链路感知阶段、方向调整阶段和下行链路传输阶段。首先利用全息感知技术获取接收器信息；然后固定旋转参数，优化6DMHS的方向和RHS的全息波束成形；最后固定方向参数，优化数字波束成形、功率分配因子和能量收集功率。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方案能够将最大波束成形增益方向与每个IDET接收器对齐，相比基准方法显著提升了IDET性能。

Conclusion: 6DMHS集成系统通过协调空间位置和波束成形，有效解决了RHS的方向波动问题，为集成数据与能量传输系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) enables cost-effective large-scale
arrays with high spatial gain. However, its amplitude-controlled holographic
beamforming suffers from directional fluctuations, making it difficult to fully
exploit the spatial gain of RHS. Fortunately, the promising 6D movable antenna
(6DMA) provides a potential solution to this problem. In this paper, we study a
6D movable holographic surface (6DMHS) integrated data and energy transfer
(IDET) system, where a three-stage protocol is proposed, consisting of an
uplink sensing stage, an orientation adjustment stage and a downlink
transmission stage, to coordinate the 6DMHS and effectively serve the IDET
receivers. Firstly, the holographic-based sensing technology is proposed and
the sensing information of the IDET receivers is exploited. Secondly, by fixing
the rotations with the sensing information, the orientation optimization
problem is formulated for designing the holographic beamforming of the RHS and
adjusting the translations of the 6DMHS. As a result, the directions with
maximum beamforming gain are aligned with each IDET receiver. Thirdly, by
fixing the orientation of the 6DMHS and the holographic beamforming, the
equivalent wireless channel is obtained. The IDET performance optimization
problem is formulated for obtaining the optimal digital beamforming, power
splitting factor and energy harvesting (EH) power. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of improving the IDET
performance compared to the benchmarks.

Conclusion: 所提出的随机优化方法为多传感器轨迹关联提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够处理复杂环境中的关联不确定性

Abstract: Collective perception is a key aspect for autonomous driving in smart cities
as it aims to combine the local environment models of multiple intelligent
vehicles in order to overcome sensor limitations. A crucial part of
multi-sensor fusion is track-to-track association. Previous works often suffer
from high computational complexity or are based on heuristics. We propose an
association algorithms based on stochastic optimization, which leverages a
multidimensional likelihood incorporating the number of tracks and their
spatial distribution and furthermore computes several association hypotheses.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in Monte Carlo simulations and
a realistic collective perception scenario computing high-likelihood
associations in ambiguous settings.

### [5] [Optimized Power Control for Multi-User Integrated Sensing and Edge AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21378)

Conclusion: 提出的两种优化代理方法和相应的收发器设计能够有效提升集成感知与边缘AI系统的性能，为实际应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: This work investigates an integrated sensing and edge artificial intelligence
(ISEA) system, where multiple devices first transmit probing signals for target
sensing and then offload locally extracted features to the access point (AP)
via analog over-the-air computation (AirComp) for collaborative inference. To
characterize the relationship between AirComp error and inference performance,
two proxies are established: the \emph{computation-optimal} proxy that
minimizes the aggregation distortion, and the \emph{decision-optimal} proxy
that maximizes the inter-class separability, respectively. Optimal transceiver
designs in terms of closed-form power allocation are derived for both
time-division multiplexing (TDM) and frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)
settings, revealing threshold-based and dual-decomposition structures,
respectively. Experimental results validate the theoretical findings.

### [7] [Incentivizing Consistent, Effective and Scalable Reasoning Capability in Audio LLMs via Reasoning Process Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20867)
*Jiajun Fan,Roger Ren,Jingyuan Li,Rahul Pandey,Prashanth Gurunath Shivakumar,Ivan Bulyko,Ankur Gandhe,Ge Liu,Yile Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CESAR通过在线强化学习框架解决音频大语言模型中的推理逆缩放问题，将推理从性能负担转变为增益，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型中的推理过程往往导致性能下降而非提升，这种现象被称为测试时逆缩放，即推理链越长性能越差。研究发现这不是推理本身的限制，而是训练不足导致的幻觉和不一致推理积累错误。

Method: 提出CESAR框架，采用在线强化学习和Group Relative Policy Optimization，通过多维度奖励机制激励正确性、格式、一致性、结构化分析模式、因果推理、领域知识整合和校准推理深度。

Result: 解决了测试时逆缩放问题，在MMAU Test-mini上超越Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-4o Audio，在MMSU推理任务上接近人类水平，同时提升了多模态推理和感知能力。

Conclusion: CESAR为开发稳健可扩展的音频大语言模型推理建立了原则性方法，证明了通过奖励推理过程而非结果验证可以显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

### [8] [Crisis-Resilient Portfolio Management via Graph-based Spatio-Temporal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20868)
*Zan Li,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRISP是一个基于图时空学习的危机弹性投资框架，通过图注意力机制自动发现资产间重要关系，在危机期间实现自适应投资组合配置，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融时间序列预测中传统方法依赖预定义图拓扑结构，无法适应危机期间市场动态变化的问题。

Method: 结合图卷积网络编码空间关系、BiLSTM与自注意力处理时间动态，通过多头图注意力网络学习稀疏结构，自动识别重要资产关系。

Result: 在2022-2024通胀驱动市场（与训练数据完全不同的机制）中保持稳健性能，夏普比率达3.76，比等权重基准提高707%，比静态图方法提高94%。

Conclusion: CRISP通过从预测中学习而非强加假设，实现了可解释的机制检测和自适应投资组合配置，在危机期间表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多目标贝叶斯优化问题具有挑战性，现有方法在生成多样化帕累托最优解方面存在不足，需要更有效的算法来覆盖整个目标空间。

Conclusion: MOBO-OSD通过正交搜索方向和帕累托前沿估计，有效解决了多目标贝叶斯优化问题，能够生成高质量且多样化的帕累托最优解集。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

Abstract: Landslides are a growing climate induced hazard with severe environmental and
human consequences, particularly in high mountain Asia. Despite increasing
access to satellite and temporal datasets, timely detection and disaster
response remain underdeveloped and fragmented. This work introduces CC-GRMAS, a
framework leveraging a series of satellite observations and environmental
signals to enhance the accuracy of landslide forecasting. The system is
structured around three interlinked agents Prediction, Planning, and Execution,
which collaboratively enable real time situational awareness, response
planning, and intervention. By incorporating local environmental factors and
operationalizing multi agent coordination, this approach offers a scalable and
proactive solution for climate resilient disaster preparedness across
vulnerable mountainous terrains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文重新探讨了增强拉格朗日方法在非凸机器学习约束问题中的应用，证明了在温和条件下的强对偶性，开发了收敛的对偶上升算法，并提供了泛化保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现代机器学习参数化大多是非凸的，拉格朗日对偶已成为处理约束学习问题的流行工具。但增强拉格朗日方法在约束学习环境中相对未被充分探索，该方法旨在减轻非凸设置中的对偶间隙，同时只需最小修改。

Conclusion: 增强拉格朗日方法在非凸约束学习问题中具有理论和实践价值，能够有效处理对偶间隙问题，并在公平机器学习等应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,
Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained
learning problems. We revisit Augmented Lagrangian methods, which aim to
mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal
modifications, and have remained comparably unexplored in constrained learning
settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove
convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions,
and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态学习方法强制弱模态与主导模态对齐，这会抑制弱模态的独特信息。需要一种新方法来处理模态不平衡问题。

Method: 提出多模态负学习框架，主导模态动态引导弱模态抑制非目标类别，而不是增强目标类别预测，从而稳定决策空间。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多个基准测试中有效且具有通用性，特别是在噪声和不平衡场景下能减少弱模态的实证误差。

Conclusion: 负学习范式通过增加单模态置信度边界，从理论上收紧多模态学习的鲁棒性下界，有效解决模态不平衡问题。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/BaoquanGong/Multimodal-Negative-Learning.git.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

Method: 基于大偏差和亚稳态分析的技术工具，对重尾SGD的全局动态进行精确刻画，通过注入并截断重尾噪声来训练模型。

Result: 重尾SGD能够几乎完全避免尖锐极小值，找到几何更平坦的局部极小值，并在测试数据上实现更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 重尾SGD结合梯度裁剪可以找到更平坦的局部极小值，从而获得更好的泛化能力，理论和实验均证实了这一发现。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于模型无关元学习（MAML）的蛋白质突变性质预测方法，结合创新的突变编码策略，显著提升了跨数据集泛化能力和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖针对特定数据集的蛋白质转换器微调，但由于实验条件异质性和目标域数据有限，在跨数据集泛化方面表现不佳。

Method: 1）首次将模型无关元学习（MAML）应用于蛋白质突变性质预测；2）使用分隔符标记的新型突变编码策略，将突变直接整合到序列上下文中；3）在转换器架构基础上集成MAML，通过最小梯度步长实现快速适应新任务。

Result: 在三个不同的蛋白质突变数据集（功能适应性、热稳定性和溶解度）上评估，相比传统微调方法显著优势：跨任务评估中，功能适应性准确率提高29%，训练时间减少65%；溶解度准确率提高94%，训练时间减少55%。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了元学习在蛋白质突变分析中的系统应用，并引入了有效的突变编码策略，为蛋白质工程中的跨域泛化提供了变革性方法学。

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了LLM集成的贝叶斯状态空间模型(LBS)，这是一个用于多模态时序预测的概率框架，结合了状态空间模型和大型语言模型来处理结构化时序数据和非结构化文本信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的预测需要整合结构化时序数据和非结构化文本信息，但现有方法在架构上受到固定输入/输出范围的限制，且无法建模或量化不确定性。

Method: LBS包含两个组件：(1)状态空间模型(SSM)主干，捕捉潜在状态的时序动态；(2)预训练的大型语言模型(LLM)，用于编码文本输入进行后验状态估计，并解码与潜在轨迹一致的文本预测。

Result: 在TextTimeCorpus基准测试中，LBS将先前最先进方法的性能提高了13.20%，同时为每个预测提供人类可读的摘要。

Conclusion: 这是首个将LLM和SSM统一用于联合数值和文本预测的工作，为多模态时序推理提供了新的基础。

Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series
data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are
architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model
or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing
LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic
framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of
two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the
temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual
observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that
is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode
textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables
flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification,
and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias
of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus
benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20%
while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the
first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction,
offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于可逆性的模型自由强化学习方法，通过模型预测路径积分控制检查学习策略的安全性，无需显式动态模型或安全约束知识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型自由强化学习缺乏形式化安全保证，现有方法通常依赖详细的安全规范知识，而许多难以规范的安全问题最好通过不变性来表征

Method: 利用可逆性作为防止安全问题的机制，使用模型预测路径积分控制在整个训练过程中检查学习策略提出的动作安全性

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在所有不安全动作发生前成功中止，同时达到与允许违反安全的基线PPO方法相当的训练进度

Conclusion: 该方法仅需查询黑盒动态的能力，无需显式动态模型或安全约束知识，就能有效提供安全保证

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

Motivation: 理解神经网络中特征学习的动态过程，特别是梯度学习算法中学习率对样本复杂度的影响，以及如何超越相关性查询的限制。

Method: 提出了一个涵盖相关性和非相关性更新的梯度学习算法框架，包括单次SGD、批次重用SGD，以及新的分层训练算法（使用不同层的学习率实现双时间尺度方法）。

Result: 证明了学习率选择对统计和计算效率的重要性，在某些情况下存在从信息指数机制到生成指数机制的相变。

Conclusion: 学习率的选择与算法设计同等重要，分层训练算法可以在不重用样本或修改损失函数的情况下超越相关性查询的限制。

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: EPFL提供了一个可扩展、安全且准确的现实世界跌倒检测解决方案，具有通过自适应反馈机制持续改进的潜力

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

Motivation: 解决传统多目标优化方法需要显式计算超体积、难以灵活融入用户偏好的问题，提供更高效的帕累托集近似方法

Method: 使用类别概率估计器预测非支配关系，结合偏好方向向量编码用户偏好，训练生成模型同时考虑帕累托成员资格和偏好对齐

Result: 在合成基准和蛋白质设计任务中表现出强大的样本效率和有效的偏好融合能力

Conclusion: A-GPS是一种简单而强大的方法，能够获得高质量的帕累托集近似，避免显式超体积计算，并灵活捕捉用户偏好

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体辩论协议将辩论视为零和博弈，导致辩论者为了获胜而误导法官，引入更多错误，表现不如单智能体方法。需要一种协作式方法来解决辩论黑客问题。

Method: ColMAD协议鼓励多个智能体以支持性的方式相互批评，补充彼此的缺失点，使法官智能体能够基于更全面的证据做出更明智的结论。

Result: 实验表明，ColMAD在错误检测任务上显著优于之前的竞争性多智能体辩论方法19%，并且相比单智能体方法带来了非平凡的改进。

Conclusion: 协作式多智能体辩论协议ColMAD通过重新定义辩论为非零和博弈，有效解决了辩论黑客问题，显著提升了错误检测性能。

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

TL;DR: RePULSe是一种新的强化学习训练方法，通过添加额外损失函数来减少不良输出的概率，同时保持平均奖励性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法主要优化平均奖励，而减少不良输出概率的方法通常会影响平均性能。需要改进这种权衡。

Method: 在标准RL损失基础上增加额外损失函数，使用学习到的建议来引导采样低奖励输出，然后降低这些输出的概率。

Result: 实验表明RePULSe在期望奖励与不良输出概率之间提供了更好的权衡，并且具有更强的对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RePULSe方法相比标准RL对齐方法和其他替代方案，在性能权衡和鲁棒性方面表现更优。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

Motivation: 现实数据通常存在噪声和歧义，传统部分标签学习方法计算量大，而深度学习方法依赖代理损失和启发式标签优化，需要更严谨的概率建模方法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法将深度学习的表达能力与概率建模的严谨性相结合，为部分标签学习提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示虽然具有分辨率独立性和高内存效率，但在特定领域应用中的准确性尚未充分了解，因此需要评估其在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示中的性能。

Method: 研究了多种缓解频谱偏差的策略，包括专用激活函数、固定和可训练位置编码、非线性核的线性组合，并在48个胸主动脉解剖结构和时空变化血流场上进行测试。

Result: 在胸主动脉血流场上，INRs实现了约230倍的压缩比，压力最大绝对误差为1mmHg，速度误差为5-10cm/s；在解剖表示中，平均和最大绝对解剖差异分别低于0.5mm和1.6mm。SIREN、MFN-Gabor和MHE架构表现最佳。

Conclusion: INRs在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示中表现出色，能够实现高压缩比和低误差，为医学图像处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速扩展使得低精度训练变得至关重要，但现有收敛理论忽略了硬件感知量化，无法解释低精度训练为何有效。

Method: 引入理论框架分析Adam和Muon在梯度、权重和优化器状态浮点量化下的收敛性，推导平滑非凸目标上的收敛速率。

Result: 两种算法在尾数长度随迭代次数对数增长时，能保持接近全精度版本的收敛速率；Adam对权重和第二矩量化高度敏感，而Muon需要更弱的误差控制。

Conclusion: 该研究缩小了低精度训练方法经验成功与理论理解之间的差距，数值实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但在科学发现方面突破有限，因为理解复杂物理现象需要超越语言的多模态表示。MOF材料设计尤其困难，其三维原子排列和配位几何规则难以用纯语言表示，且依赖难以编码的人类专业知识。

Method: L2M3OF结合预训练的晶体编码器和轻量级投影层，将结构信息压缩到标记空间中，实现与语言指令的高效对齐。模型处理结构、文本和知识三种模态，并基于精心策划的晶体材料结构-属性-知识数据库进行训练和评估。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了多模态方法在理解多孔材料中的重要性，并将L2M3OF确立为下一代材料发现AI系统的基础。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

Method: RAVEN框架动态学习弱模型的最优组合以及强模型参数，自动识别可信监督源

Result: 在图像分类、文本分类和偏好对齐任务中，RAVEN在分布外任务上比基线方法提升30%以上，在分布内任务上匹配或超越现有方法

Conclusion: RAVEN能有效解决弱到强泛化在分布偏移下的挑战，自动分配更高权重给更准确的弱模型

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

TL;DR: MeDyate是一个理论驱动的内存受限动态子网络适配框架，通过改进的层重要性度量和动态通道采样策略，在极低内存预算下实现高效的设备端神经网络训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备端神经网络训练面临严重的内存限制，阻碍了预训练模型在下游任务上的适配。现有方法在极端内存约束下性能不足，需要更有效的内存管理策略。

Method: 提出LaRa（层排序）改进的层重要性度量方法，实现原则性的层预选；采用动态通道采样策略，利用通道重要性分布在微调过程中的时间稳定性，在epoch间根据重要性加权概率重新采样通道。

Result: 在大量任务和架构上的广泛评估表明，MeDyate在极端内存约束下达到最先进性能，始终优于现有的静态和动态方法，同时保持高计算效率，可在低至几百kB RAM的内存预算下有效微调。

Conclusion: MeDyate通过理论驱动的动态子网络适配，为实现高效的设备端学习迈出了重要一步，证明了在极低内存预算下进行有效微调的可行性。

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning
with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分组格向量量化(GLVQ)框架，通过为每组权重定制格码本，在低比特量化中实现更好的性能-模型大小权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理需要大量计算资源和内存，标准均匀量化在低比特场景下会导致显著性能下降。

Method: 使用可学习生成矩阵定义定制化格码本，采用Babai舍入近似最近格点搜索解决量化过程不可微问题，训练后解码简化为矩阵向量乘法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，相比现有后训练量化基线，实现了更好的模型大小与精度权衡。

Conclusion: GLVQ框架在严格资源约束下部署大模型具有有效性，提供了高效实用的量化流程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based
forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成流网络能够根据奖励函数采样高奖励的复杂对象，但奖励函数通常从噪声数据中近似估计，导致学习策略存在认知不确定性。

Method: 构建基于多项式混沌展开的代理模型，在小规模训练流网络集合上拟合，学习奖励函数参数与流网络轨迹中各步骤动作概率分布之间的关系。

Result: 该方法在离散和连续网格世界、符号回归以及贝叶斯结构学习任务中展示了性能。

Conclusion: 代理模型可用于廉价蒙特卡洛采样，估计在不确定奖励下策略的不确定性。

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CoD的新策略，通过系统性地融入反事实解释来实现少样本任务感知知识蒸馏，仅需少量样本就能精确映射教师模型的决策边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的任务感知蒸馏方法通常需要大量数据，但在许多实际场景中这些数据可能无法获得或获取成本高昂。

Method: CoD策略利用反事实解释（CFEs）——能够以最小扰动翻转教师模型输出预测的输入，来精确映射教师决策边界。从统计和几何角度提供了理论保证。

Result: 在多个数据集和LLM上的实验表明，CoD在少样本场景（低至8-512个样本）中优于标准蒸馏方法，仅使用基线方法一半的原始样本及其对应的CFEs就能提升性能。

Conclusion: 反事实解释可以作为有效的知识探针，帮助学生更有效地模仿教师的决策边界，在数据稀缺的情况下实现高效的知识蒸馏。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练脉冲神经网络(SNN)进行多元时间序列二分类的通用框架，专注于逐步预测和在低误报率下实现高精度。使用EONS算法联合优化SNN架构和参数，并通过投票集成方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个通用的SNN训练框架，用于多元时间序列的二分类任务，特别关注在低误报率下实现高精度检测，并验证其在放射性源检测和癫痫检测等不同领域的适用性。

Method: 使用EONS算法进化稀疏、有状态的SNN，联合优化网络架构和参数。输入编码为脉冲序列，通过阈值化单个输出神经元的脉冲计数进行预测。采用简单投票集成方法提升性能和鲁棒性。

Result: 在放射性源检测任务中，仅49个神经元和66个突触的SNN在1/小时误报率下达到51.8%真阳性率，优于PCA(42.7%)和深度学习(49.8%)基线。三模型集成将真阳性率提升至67.1%。硬件部署显示2mW功耗和20.2ms推理延迟。在癫痫检测任务中，集成方法达到95%真阳性率和16%假阳性率，与深度学习相当但参数显著减少。

Conclusion: 该框架能够训练紧凑高效的SNN，在多元时间序列分类任务中实现高性能，特别是在低误报率要求下表现出色。框架具有良好的通用性，无需领域特定修改即可应用于不同任务，且硬件部署显示低功耗和低延迟优势。

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

TL;DR: 该论文建立了在流行度调整块模型(PABM)下图聚类的理论极限，证明了即使传统边密度信号消失，只要簇内和簇间流行度系数不同，聚类恢复仍然可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型(SBM和DCBM)的局限性，SBM假设顶点度均匀，DCBM在簇间应用统一的度校正，而PABM引入了簇内和簇间连接的独立流行度参数。

Method: 提出PABM模型，该模型具有更丰富的结构，其期望邻接矩阵的秩在k到k²之间。通过数值实验验证，使用k²个特征向量的谱聚类算法优于传统谱方法。

Result: 表征了PABM下聚类的最优错误率，证明了PABM捕获了DCBM忽略的度异质性维度：连接模式的局部差异可以独立于全局边密度增强簇可分性。

Conclusion: PABM提供了对图聚类复杂度的新见解，展示了局部连接模式差异的重要性，并为设计更有效的谱聚类算法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

TL;DR: DD2提出了一种新的条件分数蒸馏方法，用于实现图像自回归模型的一步采样，相比DD1在性能和训练速度上都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像自回归模型生成速度慢，需要大量采样步骤。虽然DD1实现了少步采样，但在一步采样时性能下降严重，且依赖预定义映射限制了灵活性。

Method: 将原始AR模型视为教师模型，在潜在嵌入空间中提供条件分数真值。提出条件分数蒸馏损失来训练一步生成器，通过训练单独网络预测生成分布的条件分数，并在每个token位置进行分数蒸馏。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上，DD2将一步采样的FID从3.40增加到5.43，相比最强基线DD1，将一步采样与原始AR模型的差距减少了67%，同时训练速度提升高达12.3倍。

Conclusion: DD2为实现一步AR生成迈出了重要一步，为快速高质量的自回归建模开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

Conclusion: 这是首个仅从群作用观测中成功实现通用编码器等变学习的方法，包括非平凡非阿贝尔群和计算机视觉中仿射等变性的乘积群

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

Motivation: 探索零阶优化作为解决持续学习中可塑性-稳定性-效率三难问题的新方法，特别是在内存受限的设备上。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究评估零阶优化在持续学习中的表现，并提出ZO-FC方法：对单个适配器模块使用零阶优化，同时对分类器使用一阶优化。

Result: 零阶优化增强了稳定性但削弱了可塑性，特别是在可学习分类器的情况下。ZO-FC方法在稳定性和可塑性之间取得了有效平衡。

Conclusion: ZO-FC提供了一种实用且内存高效的持续学习解决方案，特别适用于设备端部署场景。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and
configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support
reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法往往忽略物理定律，且无法量化时空预测中的固有不确定性。

Method: PCNO通过投影层在傅里叶空间强制执行质量和动量守恒；DiffPCNO利用一致性模型来量化和减轻不确定性。

Conclusion: 该两阶段框架为准确、物理基础和不确定性感知的时空预测提供了稳健且通用的方法。

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

TL;DR: 该论文提出关键词检测作为脑机接口的实用中间任务，使用LibriBrain语料库提供标准化基准，采用AUPRC和FA/h作为评估指标，并发布了一个可训练的参考模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脑机接口基准主要针对简单的基础任务，而实际应用任务如脑到文本转换仍难以实现。需要找到既实用又保护隐私的中间任务来推动研究进展。

Method: 使用52小时的LibriBrain语料库，提供标准化的训练/验证/测试分割。采用针对极端类别不平衡的评估协议，使用AUPRC和FA/h指标。开发了基于1-D Conv/ResNet的紧凑基线模型，采用焦点损失和top-k池化。

Result: 参考模型在保留会话上实现了约13倍于置换基线的AUPRC，证明了任务的可行性。探索性分析显示：性能随训练时间对数线性提升，词频和持续时间等词级因素系统性地影响可检测性。

Conclusion: 关键词检测是脑机接口的一个可行且实用的中间任务，为脑到文本转换研究提供了有前景的方向，同时发布的工具库将促进社区进一步研究。

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于在线多类选择问题的公平分配算法，通过无损舍入方案和资源预留机制确保群体公平性，同时支持多类别代理的处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文献中的两个关键限制：缺乏无损舍入方案确保整数解与分数解性能相同，以及处理属于多个类别的代理带来的挑战。

Method: 基于松弛-舍入框架的随机算法，首先使用资源预留机制计算分数解以保证类别间公平性，然后通过无损舍入保持公平性且不降低性能。还提出了结合机器学习预测的学习增强变体。

Result: 算法能够确保整数解达到与任何分数解相同的期望性能，同时保持跨类别的公平性保证。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了在线多类选择中的公平分配问题，特别是在处理多类别代理时表现出色，学习增强变体进一步平衡了公平性和效率。

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着策略优化在机器人、医疗和大语言模型训练等敏感领域的广泛应用，隐私保护需求日益迫切，需要研究差分隐私下的策略优化方法。

Method: 首先形式化了适用于策略优化的差分隐私定义，然后通过统一框架系统分析了策略梯度、自然策略梯度等常用PO算法在DP约束下的样本复杂性。

Conclusion: 该研究为隐私保护策略优化算法提供了有价值的实践见解，证明了在保持隐私的同时实现有效策略优化的可行性。

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the
quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset
(2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our
framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to
estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters,
including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well
as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed
and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and
mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;
our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach
offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring
complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale
in situ measurements. Processed data products and analysis tools are made
publicly available to advance future studies of solar wind dynamics and space
weather forecasting. The code and configuration files used in this study are

Method: 采用选择最短答案的简单启发式方法，基于模型在简洁自信和冗长过度思考两种模式下的表现差异。

Result: 该方法在两项挑战性基准测试中与自一致性等复杂方法表现相当，同时显著减少计算开销。

Conclusion: 最短答案启发式方法提供了相对于自一致性的帕累托改进，适用于输出等价性定义不明确的任务。

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

Motivation: 理解深度网络成功背后的神经崩溃现象，特别是要超越先前将最后一层特征视为无约束优化变量的假设，探索数据结构和非线性激活对NC的影响。

Method: 分析在正交可分数据上训练的两层ReLU网络，通过梯度流方法研究其训练动态，证明NC现象的出现。

Result: 证明了梯度流在这种网络架构下确实会展现出神经崩溃现象，即最后一层特征会形成简单的结构模式。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了对神经崩溃现象的理论理解，揭示了数据结构和训练动态的隐式偏置在促进NC出现中的关键作用。

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备计算资源有限，但其统一内存架构和CPU-GPU性能差距较小，为CPU-GPU协同执行提供了机会，但面临同步开销大和执行时间预测困难的问题。

Method: 使用OpenCL细粒度共享虚拟内存(SVM)实现轻量级同步机制，并开发机器学习模型来准确预测CPU和GPU任务的执行时间，包括GPU内核的性能特征和调度时间。

Result: 在四个移动平台上评估，线性层加速比达1.89倍，卷积层达1.75倍，接近通过穷举搜索找到的最大可达到值(2.01倍和1.87倍)。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够快速选择CPU-GPU协同执行策略，显著提升移动设备上深度神经网络推理性能。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DictPFL是一个实用的联邦学习框架，通过将模型权重分解为静态字典和可更新的查找表，仅对后者进行加密传输，实现了全梯度保护同时大幅降低计算和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于同态加密的联邦学习方法存在两极化问题：要么全加密带来高昂开销，要么部分加密存在隐私泄露风险。需要一种既能保护所有传输梯度隐私，又不会产生过高计算和通信成本的方法。

Method: 提出两个关键模块：DePE将模型权重分解为静态字典和可更新查找表，仅加密传输查找表；PrME通过加密感知剪枝和历史引导掩码最小化加密参数数量。

Result: 相比全加密联邦学习，DictPFL减少通信成本402-748倍，加速训练28-65倍；相比选择性加密方法，减少开销51-155倍，速度提升4-19倍。运行时间仅比明文联邦学习慢2倍以内。

Conclusion: DictPFL首次证明基于同态加密的私有联邦学习在实际部署中是可行的，为现实世界应用提供了实用的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available
at https://github.com/UCF-ML-Research/DictPFL.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据，但在药物发现和材料科学中往往缺乏足够的标注样本。现有的少样本分子性质预测方法通过分子-性质图引入关系归纳偏置，但结构指导有限。

Method: 构建全局三元异质图（基序-分子-性质）捕获长程组合模式，同时在局部为每个节点构建子图并分别编码，使模型关注最相关的邻近分子和基序。

Result: 在五个标准FSMPP基准测试中，该方法持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 整合全局基序知识与细粒度局部上下文能有效推进稳健的少样本分子性质预测。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and
materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large
labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property
prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational
inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property
nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We
propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for
few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information
at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful
motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional
groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph,
yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range
compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with
common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the
molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's
attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments
on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the
effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local
context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

TL;DR: ESCORT是一个基于粒子的框架，用于在高维信念空间中捕捉复杂多模态分布，通过相关感知投影和时间一致性约束改进SVGD方法，在信念近似精度和决策质量上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着环境变得更加真实，信念分布变得复杂，标准数学模型无法准确捕捉，现有POMDP信念近似方法无法准确表示复杂不确定性结构（如高维多模态信念分布），导致估计错误和次优决策。

Method: 扩展SVGD方法，引入两个关键创新：相关感知投影（建模状态维度间的依赖关系）和时间一致性约束（在保持相关结构的同时稳定更新），保留SVGD的吸引-排斥粒子动力学。

Result: 在POMDP领域和合成多模态分布上的广泛评估表明，ESCORT在信念近似精度和下游决策质量方面持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: ESCORT能够动态适应信念景观复杂性，无需重采样或限制性分布假设，为复杂高维信念空间提供了有效的表示方法。

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

Result: 在合成数据集和真实世界数据上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够平衡不同群体间的下游预测性能，适用于特征收集成本高昂的场景。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

Motivation: 现有集中式光伏方法难以应用于分布式光伏系统，因为分布式光伏面临电网级数据缺失、安装容量时间变化、地理变异性和面板多样性等挑战。

Method: 将聚合功率输出建模为小电网输出的组合，每个电网输出使用单位输出函数乘以其容量进行建模，将同质单位输出函数与动态容量解耦以实现准确预测。

Conclusion: SolarBoost为电网运行提供了有价值的见解，其代码已在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性-二次模型如Holmström-Milgrom有闭式解，但现实环境中非线性效用、随机动态或高维动作通常无法获得闭式解，需要通用计算框架。

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

Result: 在标准持续学习基准测试中，PLAN始终优于现有方法，为基础模型的持续学习建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: PLAN框架通过主动管理任务子空间分配和干扰最小化策略，在持续学习场景中实现了高效且有效的知识保留和新任务适应。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks
without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose
\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在科学同行评审中的潜在使用增加，需要全面数据集来理解其效用和影响，此前缺乏这样的数据集。

Method: 构建GenReview数据集，为ICLR 2018-2025所有提交论文使用三种独立提示（负面、正面、中性）生成81K条LLM评审意见，并与原始论文和评审关联。

Result: 研究发现：LLM在评审中存在偏见；LLM撰写的评审目前可以自动检测；LLM并不总是严格遵循评审指导；LLM提供的评分仅与论文接受决定一致。

Conclusion: GenReview数据集为研究LLM在科学同行评审中的影响提供了宝贵资源，揭示了LLM在评审过程中的局限性和潜在问题。

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

### [64] [Online AUC Optimization Based on Second-order Surrogate Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21202)
*JunRu Luo,Difei Cheng,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于成对铰链损失的新型二阶代理损失函数，用于在线AUC优化，解决了传统方法中非凸不连续损失和内存成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AUC是分类任务中重要的性能指标，特别是在类别不平衡场景下。但最小化AUC面临挑战：成对0/1损失的非凸不连续性质难以优化，以及实例级存储的高内存成本在大规模应用中造成瓶颈。

Method: 提出一种基于成对铰链损失的二阶代理损失函数，开发高效在线算法。不同于传统方法用实例级代理函数近似每个成对损失项，该方法直接用一个基于训练数据一阶和二阶统计量构建的代理损失函数替代整个聚合的成对损失。

Result: 理论分析表明，现有在线AUC优化算法通常达到O(√T)遗憾界，而该方法获得更紧的O(ln T)界。通过核方法扩展到非线性设置。在多个基准数据集上的实验证明了所提二阶代理损失在优化在线AUC性能方面的优越效率和效果。

Conclusion: 提出的二阶代理损失方法为在线AUC优化提供了更高效和有效的解决方案，在理论保证和实际性能方面均优于传统方法。

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TabPFN等基于上下文学习的表格基础模型通过纯合成数据集预训练就能在真实数据上表现良好，但合成先验分布的设计原则仍不明确，需要系统研究。

Method: 系统识别合成先验分布的关键属性，并基于这些洞察开发了Mitra模型，使用经过筛选的多样化、有区分度的合成先验分布混合物进行训练。

Result: Mitra在分类和回归基准测试中一致优于TabPFNv2和TabICL等最先进的TFMs，且具有更好的样本效率。

Conclusion: 合成先验分布的设计对表格基础模型的泛化性能至关重要，精心选择的多样化先验混合物能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

Motivation: 传统GNN的固定消息传递架构难以适应现实世界图的多样性，现有图MoE方法依赖监督信号且训练不稳定。

Method: 采用骨干-残差专家架构，基础编码器提供稳定性，残差专家捕获多样化计算模式，结构感知门控网络进行细粒度节点路由，使用统一无监督目标训练。

Result: 在16个基准测试中验证了ADaMoRE在无监督节点分类和少样本学习方面的最先进性能，具有更好的泛化性、训练效率和收敛速度。

Conclusion: ADaMoRE为图神经网络提供了一种稳健、完全无监督的异构MoE训练框架，显著提升了在多样化图和任务上的适应性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

Conclusion: 将物理语义嵌入生成流可以将不透明的神经轨迹转化为可解释的物理过程。

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

Result: 实证研究表明，可实现的混淆程度与近似模型的不确定性相关。

Conclusion: 这一发现可能为深度基于模型的强化学习提供理论基础的探索策略。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics
of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation
of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We
corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a cornerstone of sequence modeling
across various scientific and industrial applications. Owing to their
versatility, numerous RNN variants have been proposed over the past decade,
aiming to improve the modeling of long-term dependencies and to address
challenges such as vanishing and exploding gradients. However, no central
library is available to test these variations, and reimplementing diverse
architectures can be time-consuming and error-prone, limiting reproducibility

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了二阶训练的内存瓶颈问题，为PINNs提供了理论支撑的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图注意力在全局交互学习中面临过聚合问题，即大量消息聚合到单个节点时导致关键信息被稀释和信息丢失。

Method: 将节点聚合分为并行过程，限制每次聚合的输入量，并通过排序和加权机制优先处理信息量大的消息。

Result: 评估显示Wideformer能有效缓解过聚合问题，使骨干方法能够专注于信息量大的消息，性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Wideformer通过并行化聚合和消息优先级机制，成功解决了图注意力中的过聚合问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

*Hyeongyu Kim,Geonhui Han,Dosik Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于Buffer层的新范式，解决传统测试时适应方法依赖归一化层更新的局限性，通过保持预训练主干完整性来避免灾难性遗忘，在各种架构中实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法主要依赖归一化层更新，但存在对批量大小敏感、受限于预训练模型结构等问题，限制了在显著域偏移下的有效性。

Method: 引入Buffer层概念，不修改模型核心参数，保持预训练主干完整性，可无缝集成到现有TTA框架中。

Conclusion: Buffer层方法有效解决了归一化层更新的根本局限性，验证了在真实世界域适应场景中的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于PatchTST变换器的传感器特定集成方法，通过噪声匹配的数据增强和四传感器模型集成，在噪声条件下实现鲁棒的人类活动识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在真实世界噪声条件下人类活动识别的鲁棒性问题，特别是针对WEAR数据集挑战中传感器噪声的挑战。

Method: 使用PatchTST变换器架构，为四个惯性传感器位置分别训练独立模型，采用时间窗口增强（抖动、缩放、旋转、通道丢弃）来模拟测试时噪声，最后通过概率平均进行模型集成。

Result: 在私有排行榜上获得了显著高于基线的宏F1分数，证明了该方法在噪声条件下的有效性。

Conclusion: 测试匹配的数据增强与基于变换器的模型集成相结合，是在噪声条件下实现鲁棒人类活动识别的有效策略。

Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human
activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages
the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per
inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding
windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and
test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized
jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to
generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute
softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and
average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline
achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that
test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an
effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了DVC方法，一种预算感知的数据选择和评估方法，专门针对多层感知机训练中的动态网络参数演化，通过分层评估数据贡献来提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法存在关键局限：过度简化非线性变换、忽略隐藏层中间表示、计算复杂度高难以扩展到大型MLP。需要一种能考虑训练过程中网络参数动态演化的数据评估方法。

Method: DVC方法将数据贡献分解为层值贡献(LVC)和全局值贡献(GVC)，使用6个精心设计的指标和高效算法，从质量、相关性和分布多样性三个维度捕获数据特征，并结合UCB算法进行自适应源选择。

Conclusion: 这是神经网络分层数据评估的首个系统性处理方法，为大规模机器学习系统提供了理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了GAMs解释性计算效率的假设，分析了不同形式GAMs生成解释的计算复杂性，发现在标准复杂性假设下，GAMs的解释复杂性受输入空间结构、组件模型类型、回归与分类任务差异等因素显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然广义加性模型(GAMs)在机器学习社区中被认为是可解释的，但作者质疑为其生成有意义的解释是否真的计算高效且可行，旨在系统分析GAMs解释的计算复杂性。

Method: 通过计算复杂性理论分析，在P!=NP等标准复杂性假设下，研究不同形式GAMs在不同上下文中的解释生成复杂性，考察输入空间结构、组件模型类型、任务类型等因素的影响。

Result: 发现GAMs解释复杂性呈现多样化结果：输入空间结构对复杂性有显著影响；组件模型类型的复杂性差异仅在特定输入域设置下显现；回归与分类任务的解释复杂性存在显著区别；神经网络加性表达仅在特定解释方法和输入域下更易解释。

Conclusion: 研究为GAMs多样化解释的计算可行性提供了严谨的理论图景，明确了在何种条件下这些计算是可能的或可证明困难的。

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

TL;DR: EPHAD是一个测试时自适应框架，用于处理训练数据被异常污染的无监督异常检测问题，通过结合预训练模型和传统方法在测试时更新模型输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的异常检测数据集通常包含未被检测到或错误标记的异常，导致性能显著下降，而现有解决方案需要访问训练管道、数据或异常比例的先验知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出EPHAD框架，在测试时使用多模态基础模型（如CLIP）、经典异常检测方法（如潜在异常因子）或领域特定知识收集证据，更新在污染数据集上训练的异常检测模型的输出。

Result: 在8个视觉异常检测数据集、26个表格异常检测数据集和1个真实工业数据集上的综合实验验证了EPHAD的有效性，消融研究分析了超参数影响和对不同污染水平的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EPHAD展示了在各种异常检测模型和证据对中的多功能性和鲁棒性，为解决训练数据污染的异常检测问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注建模选择对模型多样性的影响，而数据在塑造多样性方面的关键作用被相对忽视。本文旨在探讨单个数据点差异对模型多样性的影响。

Method: 引入邻接数据集框架，分析单个数据点差异对模型多样性的影响。通过严格的数学证明验证发现，并将框架扩展到主动学习和数据插补两个实际领域。

Result: 发现邻接数据集中类间分布重叠度越高，模型多样性反而越低，这与传统预期相反。这种反转现象源于共享的Rashomon参数。

Conclusion: 数据在模型多样性中扮演关键角色，类间分布重叠可以降低模型多样性。基于这一发现，提出了多样性感知的主动学习数据获取策略和多样性感知的数据插补技术。

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多臂老虎机遗憾度量无法解决奖励分配的公平性问题，特别是在需要公平分配奖励的场景中，如临床试验中的患者分配。

Method: 采用初始均匀探索阶段后接标准上置信界(UCB)算法，仅依赖加性Hoeffding界，可自然扩展到次高斯奖励分布。

Result: 该方法实现了近乎最优的Nash遗憾，并能推广到更广泛的p-均值遗憾度量，在所有p值上均获得(近乎)最优遗憾界。

Conclusion: 相比现有需要强假设的专门化算法，本文方法在更弱假设下实现了公平性度量的最优性能，具有更好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

TL;DR: SANI是一种用于净化语言模型的遗忘方法，通过重置模型最后几层的特定神经元来破坏细粒度信息的记忆，然后进行微调以避免记忆敏感信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在特定任务上微调时会记忆敏感数据（如医疗报告、商业数据），这些记忆的信息在后续使用中可能被泄露，造成隐私或机密性问题。

Method: SANI包含擦除和修复两个阶段：1）重置模型最后几层的特定神经元以破坏记忆；2）在避免记忆敏感信息的情况下微调模型。

Result: 仅需少量额外的遗忘训练轮次，模型就能被净化，信息泄露数量大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该方法特别适用于医院或其他行业，这些行业已在大型数据集上投入大量资源训练模型，希望在共享前对其进行净化。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

Conclusion: ScoreNF能够减少对计算昂贵的MCMC生成训练数据的依赖，提供了一种评估模式覆盖和模式塌陷行为的方法。

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

Result: C-MCTD能够进行全局感知规划，降低搜索复杂度，并加速推理过程。

Conclusion: C-MCTD成功将规划从单个轨迹优化提升到完整规划组合的推理，解决了MCTD的局限性。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

Conclusion: 提出的成本敏感超参数优化方法能够有效平衡计算成本和模型性能，在冻结-解冻贝叶斯优化框架下实现了更高效的优化过程。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/db-Lee/CFBO.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解耦表示学习方法依赖因素特定的策略，当遇到不符合先前假设的新因素或多个因素共存时，需要重新设计架构或目标，导致显著开销。

Method: 引入组合偏置作为模块化归纳偏置，根据因素特定的重组规则随机混合潜在变量，通过先验损失和组合一致性损失迫使编码器发现因素结构。

Result: 在属性和对象解缠方面表现出竞争力，并独特地实现了全局风格和对象的联合解缠。

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单的混合策略调整即可实现属性、对象甚至两者的解缠，无需修改目标或架构，具有通用性和灵活性。

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

Motivation: 利用大语言模型作为可扩展的替代方案，研究生物系统中表征变化的假设，特别是关联学习如何重塑内部表征。

Method: 基于大语言模型的上下文学习能力，采用认知神经科学关联学习范式，在六个模型中分析表征演变过程。

Conclusion: 大语言模型不仅是研究类人学习系统表征动态的强大工具，也是生成关于大脑记忆重组原理新假设的可访问通用计算模型。

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

Result: 在线性逆问题上的实验表明，自扩散方法相比其他方法达到竞争性或更优的性能

Conclusion: 自扩散提供了一种灵活通用的逆问题解决方案，不依赖预训练模型，能适应各种前向算子和噪声条件

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理信息的极限学习机（PIELM）框架，用于解决反Stefan问题。该方法用极限学习机网络替代传统深度神经网络，固定输入权重，通过最小二乘法优化输出权重，显著提高了预测精度和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在解决Stefan问题时存在超参数依赖性强、训练效率低和预测精度不足的问题。本文旨在开发一种更快速、更准确的物理信息学习方法来解决反Stefan问题。

Method: PIELM框架使用极限学习机网络替代深度神经网络，固定输入权重，通过最小二乘法优化输出权重来构建物理定律损失向量。该方法将反Stefan问题转化为寻找Moore-Penrose广义逆的问题。

Result: 案例研究表明，与传统PINNs相比，PIELM在相对L2误差方面提高了3-7个数量级的预测精度，同时节省了超过94%的训练时间。

Conclusion: PIELM框架为反Stefan问题提供了一种高效、准确的解决方案，在保持物理约束的同时显著提升了计算效率和预测精度。

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

Method: 每个智能体学习稀疏局部因果掩码识别影响其动态的最小邻域变量，生成近似紧凑表示；元actor-critic在多个源域上训练共享策略，并在测试时通过少量轨迹估计新域因子。

Result: GSAC能够快速适应新领域，显著优于从头学习和传统适应基线方法。

Conclusion: GSAC通过因果表示学习和元学习相结合，有效解决了大规模网络系统中的可扩展性和领域泛化问题，具有理论保证和实际性能优势。

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer方法如Decision Transformer存在冗余令牌化和二次注意力复杂度问题，限制了在实时或资源受限环境中的可扩展性。

Method: 开发了UTR表示法，将轨迹中的return-to-go、状态和动作合并为单一令牌。基于此构建了UDT(Transformer架构)和UDC(门控CNN架构)两个变体。

Result: 两种变体均达到或优于最先进方法的性能，同时计算量显著降低。理论分析显示UTR具有更紧的Rademacher复杂度边界，表明更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UTR在不同架构中泛化良好，可能为未来大规模决策模型提供高效基础。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

Motivation: 传统RNN的序列性限制了并行计算能力，而现有的并行架构如Transformers和状态空间模型(SSMs)虽然能并行化，但SSMs的线性约束限制了其表达能力，无法建模复杂的非线性序列依赖关系。

Method: 将非线性递归关系序列转化为单一方程组系统，使用牛顿迭代结合自定义并行归约进行并行求解，实现了非线性RNN的并行训练。

Result: 实现了高达665倍的加速比，成功训练了70亿参数的LSTM和GRU变体模型，在困惑度指标上与同等规模的Transformers和Mamba2架构相当。

Conclusion: ParaRNN打破了非线性RNN的序列并行化障碍，为大规模非线性序列建模提供了可行方案，并开源了代码框架以促进高效序列建模研究。

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear
RNN models at scale.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释复杂系统（如推荐系统）的输出对用户和公司都至关重要。用户上传的照片往往是为了强化或证明他们对物品的评价，因此预测用户会拍摄的照片可以作为最佳说服论据。

Method: 提出一个形式化框架来估计给定（用户，照片）对的作者概率，使用TripAdvisor收集的餐厅评论（含照片）数据进行验证。

Result: 通过预测用户可能拍摄的照片，推荐系统能够解释其推荐结果，同时公司可以了解客户对产品最关注的方面。

Conclusion: 将个性化解释作为推荐来学习的方法能够提高推荐系统的可靠性，并为公司提供关于客户偏好的生动知识。

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果机器学习方法通常假设已知暴露映射，这在现实中往往不切实际；同时同质性和处理分配机制的交互会引发网络级协变量偏移，导致处理效应估计不准确。

Method: HINet方法整合图神经网络与领域对抗训练，能够在未知暴露映射下估计处理效应，同时减轻网络级协变量偏移的影响。

Result: 在合成和半合成网络数据集上的广泛实证评估证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HINet方法能够有效解决网络环境中异质处理效应估计的挑战，特别是在未知暴露映射和协变量偏移的情况下。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a
dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Vapnik和Chervonenkis的经典框架，引入了均匀均值可估性(UME-learnability)概念，研究分布集合在任意估计器下是否允许均匀均值估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工作主要关注经验均值估计器的均匀收敛性(P-Glivenko-Cantelli)，本文旨在超越这一限制，探索更一般的均匀均值估计条件。

Method: 在分布集合的均值向量空间上工作，分析均值向量的可分性条件与UME-learnability的关系。

Result: 证明均值向量的可分性是UME-learnability的充分条件，但非必要条件；构造了非可分但UME-learnable的分布集合；证明UME-learnable集合的可数并也是UME-learnable。

Conclusion: 解决了Cohen等人(2025)提出的猜想，建立了均匀均值可估性的基本理论框架。

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

*Huatian Gong,Jiuh-Biing Sheu,Zheng Wang,Xiaoguang Yang,Ran Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出统一模型(UM)同时解决8种灾后道路评估变体问题，通过单一神经网络训练实现参数和训练时间减少8倍，在解质量上优于单任务DRL方法6-14%，优于传统优化方法24-82%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决灾后道路评估中无人机路由问题，传统优化方法扩展性差，现有深度强化学习方法需要为每个问题变体单独训练模型，缺乏适应性和灵活性。

Method: 使用现代transformer编码器-解码器架构，通过多问题配置训练单一神经网络，采用轻量级适配器机制实现对新属性的高效微调。

Result: UM在1000节点网络中实现实时求解(1-10秒)，微调实验表明能以最小成本有效整合未见属性并保持高解质量。

Conclusion: UM为时间关键型应用推进了神经组合优化，提供了计算高效、高质量且适应性强的无人机灾后道路评估解决方案。

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

### [102] [Probe-based Fine-tuning for Reducing Toxicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21531)
*Jan Wehner,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在训练过程中使用探针作为监督信号时，探针检测可靠性是否会下降的问题。通过实验发现，基于探针的偏好优化比基于分类器的方法能更好地保持探针可检测性，且探针多样性带来的实际效益有限，通过重新训练探针即可恢复高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探针可用于检测模型内部的不良行为（如欺骗或偏见），但当这些监控工具成为训练目标时，可能会因Goodhart定律而失去可靠性。本文旨在探索在训练中使用探针作为监督信号时，如何保持探针检测的准确性。

Method: 提出了两种基于监督微调和直接偏好优化的探针训练方法，在毒性检测测试平台上进行实验。评估了三种保持探针准确性的策略：训练对抗探针集成、保留未用于训练的探针、训练后重新训练新探针。

Result: 基于探针的偏好优化意外地比基于分类器的方法更好地保持了探针可检测性；探针多样性提供的实际效益有限，只需在优化后重新训练探针即可恢复高检测精度。

Conclusion: 基于探针的训练对于某些对齐方法是可行的，当重新训练可行时，探针集成基本上是不必要的。

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为时空区域扭曲（SRD）的伪异常生成方法，通过增强弱监督视频异常检测模型的对抗鲁棒性，解决了现有模型易受对抗攻击的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督视频异常检测（WSVAD）模型容易受到对抗攻击，但由于只有视频级标签而缺乏帧级监督，传统的对抗训练方法效果不佳。直接使用模型生成的伪标签进行对抗训练会产生噪声，显著降低性能。

Method: 提出时空区域扭曲（SRD）方法，通过对正常视频中的局部区域应用严重增强来创建合成异常，同时保持时间一致性。将这些精确标注的合成异常与噪声伪标签结合，显著减少标签噪声，实现有效的对抗训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提升了WSVAD模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，整体AUROC性能平均比现有最优方法高出71.0%。

Conclusion: SRD方法通过生成精确标注的合成异常，有效解决了弱监督设置下对抗训练中的标签噪声问题，显著增强了WSVAD模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

*Nikolai Gruzinov,Ksenia Sycheva,Earl T. Barr,Alex Bezzubov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了修订相似性问题，并开发了Excision Score (ES)来衡量文档修订的相似性，解决了现有度量方法（如BLEU）因共享内容主导而无法准确反映人类判断的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相似性度量方法（如BLEU）在评估文档修订时，由于共享内容占主导地位，无法准确反映人类对修订差异的判断，需要一种能更好对齐人类判断的度量方法。

Method: 提出Excision Score (ES)，通过最长公共子序列(LCS)移除现有文档与修订版本间的共享内容，然后仅比较剩余的不同区域，并使用近似方法将标准立方LCS计算加速到二次。

Result: 在代码编辑评估中，ES在HumanEvalFix上比最接近的竞争对手SARI提高了12%的皮尔逊相关性，比标准度量（如BLEU）提高了>21%。当增加共享上下文时，ES相对于SARI的改进增加到20%，相对于标准度量提高到>30%。

Conclusion: ES是一种有效的修订相似性度量方法，能够正确处理共享上下文、代码块移动、匹配插入或删除等复杂情况，比现有方法更好地与人类判断对齐。

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低空经济中SAGIN-MEC系统面临的异构节点协调、移动性建模、部分可观测环境下的实时决策等挑战，实现灵活广域计算服务。

Method: 采用分层SAGIN-MEC架构，提出MADDPG-COCG算法：使用MADDPG优化连续时间决策，结合凸优化和联盟博弈处理混合变维度决策。

Result: 相比基准算法，显著降低了用户设备总成本、任务完成延迟和能耗，仅轻微增加无人机能耗，且具有优越的收敛稳定性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: MADDPG-COCG算法能有效解决SAGIN-MEC中的复杂优化问题，提升用户中心性能，为低空经济提供可行的计算服务解决方案。

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

TL;DR: ZETA是一个零样本多模态框架，通过将ECG信号与结构化的临床观察结果进行比较来实现可解释的心电图诊断，无需疾病特定微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动化ECG诊断系统在透明性和对未见病症的泛化能力方面存在不足，需要与临床工作流程对齐的可解释诊断方法。

Method: 使用LLM辅助、专家验证的过程构建结构化临床观察数据集，利用预训练多模态模型对齐ECG和文本嵌入，进行零样本分类。

Result: ZETA在零样本分类性能上具有竞争力，并提供定性和定量证据表明其增强了可解释性，将预测基于特定的临床相关诊断特征。

Conclusion: 将ECG分析与结构化临床知识对齐有助于构建更透明、可泛化和可信赖的AI诊断系统。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

Motivation: 神经网络擅长处理非结构化数据但泛化能力差，而经典算法保证正确性但缺乏灵活性。探索将经典算法的先验知识嵌入GNN是否能提升分子图数据的预测性能。

Method: 在CLRS算法推理基准的24个经典算法上预训练GNN，然后使用预训练模型初始化并冻结分子预测GNN的选定层。

Result: 相比随机初始化基线，预训练模型在ogbg-molhiv和ogbg-molclintox任务上分别获得6%和3%的绝对性能提升，其中线段相交算法和Dijkstra算法预训练效果最佳。

Conclusion: 将经典算法先验嵌入GNN提供了有用的归纳偏置，能够提升复杂真实世界图数据的处理性能。

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

Conclusion: 神经网络通过分层密度演化构建语义表示，参数冗余在正则化条件下有助于泛化而非过拟合，这挑战了传统的偏差-方差权衡理论。

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

Conclusion: REVE支持标准化EEG研究，加速临床神经科学进展，发布代码、预训练权重和教程。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

TL;DR: 提出HOPSS算法，通过同源扰动方法在解空间中直接生成训练数据集，显著减少时间步数，降低数据生成的计算和时间开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动深度学习方法需要大量解对数据，这些数据通常通过传统数值方法生成，需要数千个时间步迭代，远多于训练所需的几十个，造成沉重的计算和时间开销。

Method: 首先从可靠求解器获取基础解函数，通过降采样对齐时间步；然后提出"同源扰动"方法：将两个解函数（一个作为主函数，另一个作为同源扰动项）与随机噪声结合，高效生成精度相当的PDE数据点；最后用这些数据点计算原始方程右端项的变化来形成新的解对。

Result: 理论和实验结果表明HOPSS降低了时间复杂度。例如在Navier-Stokes方程上，生成10,000个样本仅需传统方法约10%的时间，且模型训练性能相当。

Conclusion: HOPSS算法能够显著加速PDE训练数据集的生成，同时保持模型训练所需的近似精度，为解决非线性时间偏微分方程的数据生成问题提供了高效方案。

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

Motivation: SHAP解释对于决策树等简单模型可在多项式时间内计算，但对于神经网络等更复杂的黑盒模型则变为NP难问题。本文旨在解决张量网络这类更广泛模型类别的SHAP计算问题。

Method: 提出了计算任意结构张量网络精确SHAP解释的通用框架，特别针对张量链结构设计了并行计算算法，并将结果推广到决策树、树集成、线性模型和线性RNN等模型。

Result: 对于张量链结构的TN，SHAP计算可在对数多项式时间内并行完成；对于二值化神经网络，当网络宽度固定时SHAP计算变得高效可处理，但即使深度固定计算仍然困难。

Conclusion: 张量网络的SHAP计算在特定结构下可高效完成，且对于二值化神经网络，宽度而非深度是SHAP计算的主要计算瓶颈，这一发现对模型解释性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前合成数据生成方法仅能复制简单统计摘要，但无法保留定义真实世界系统复杂多变量交互的成对和高阶相关结构，导致合成数据在复杂建模任务中失效。

Method: 使用Cholesky分解目标相关矩阵来生成合成数据，该方法在数学上保证保留源数据集的完整相关结构，包括简单成对关系到高阶交互。

Conclusion: GCM为合成数据生成提供了新方法，在隐私保护数据共享、鲁棒模型训练和模拟等领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

TL;DR: DEEDEE是一个用于强化学习时间序列的OOD检测器，使用两个统计量（episodewise均值和RBF核相似度）来检测分布偏移，计算效率比现有方法高600倍，准确率平均提升5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键环境中部署强化学习受到分布偏移脆弱性的限制，需要开发高效的OOD检测方法。

Method: 使用两个统计量：episodewise均值和RBF核相似度，捕捉全局和局部偏差，避免复杂的表示学习。

Result: 在标准RL OOD测试套件中，DEEDEE匹配或超越现有检测器，计算量减少600倍，准确率平均提升5%。

Conclusion: RL轨迹中的多种异常类型可以通过少量低阶统计量捕获，为复杂环境中的OOD检测提供了紧凑基础。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Conclusion: 首次揭示了神经TSP求解器在节点选择前计算的内容，证明几何结构无需显式监督即可出现，为结合神经效率和算法可解释性的透明混合系统提供了路径。

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

Result: 在参考测度和边缘分布的温和结构假设下，IMF实现了非渐近指数收敛。

Conclusion: 该分析为扩散薛定谔桥及其匹配变体(DSBM)的理论保证铺平了道路。

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem has become a fundamental tool in
computational optimal transport and generative modeling. To address this
problem, ideal methods such as Iterative Proportional Fitting and Iterative
Markovian Fitting (IMF) have been proposed-alongside practical approximations
like Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge and its Matching (DSBM) variant. While
previous work have established asymptotic convergence guarantees for IMF, a
quantitative, non-asymptotic understanding remains unknown. In this paper, we
provide the first non-asymptotic exponential convergence guarantees for IMF
under mild structural assumptions on the reference measure and marginal
distributions, assuming a sufficiently large time horizon. Our results
encompass two key regimes: one where the marginals are log-concave, and another
where they are weakly log-concave. The analysis relies on new contraction
results for the Markovian projection operator and paves the way to theoretical
guarantees for DSBM.

Abstract: Adversarial training has emerged as a key technique to enhance model
robustness against adversarial input perturbations. Many of the existing
methods rely on computationally expensive min-max problems that limit their
application in practice. We propose a novel formulation of adversarial training
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, shifting from input to feature-space
perturbations. This reformulation enables the exact solution of inner
maximization and efficient optimization. It also provides a regularized
estimator that naturally adapts to the noise level and the smoothness of the
underlying function. We establish conditions under which the feature-perturbed
formulation is a relaxation of the original problem and propose an efficient
optimization algorithm based on iterative kernel ridge regression. We provide
generalization bounds that help to understand the properties of the method. We
also extend the formulation to multiple kernel learning. Empirical evaluation
shows good performance in both clean and adversarial settings.

Conclusion: DRAF算法能有效解决多敏感属性下的子群公平性问题，特别是在处理大量小子群时表现出色，为算法公平性研究提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness is a socially crucial topic in real-world applications
of AI.
  Among many notions of fairness, subgroup fairness is widely studied when
multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, age) are present.
  However, as the number of sensitive attributes grows, the number of subgroups
increases accordingly, creating heavy computational burdens and data sparsity
problem (subgroups with too small sizes).
  In this paper, we develop a novel learning algorithm for subgroup fairness
which resolves these issues by focusing on subgroups with sufficient sample
sizes as well as marginal fairness (fairness for each sensitive attribute).
  To this end, we formalize a notion of subgroup-subset fairness and introduce
a corresponding distributional fairness measure called the supremum Integral
Probability Metric (supIPM).
  Building on this formulation, we propose the Doubly Regressing Adversarial
learning for subgroup Fairness (DRAF) algorithm, which reduces a surrogate
fairness gap for supIPM with much less computation than directly reducing
supIPM.
  Theoretically, we prove that the proposed surrogate fairness gap is an upper
bound of supIPM.
  Empirically, we show that the DRAF algorithm outperforms baseline methods in
benchmark datasets, specifically when the number of sensitive attributes is
large so that many subgroups are very small.

Result: 在18个真实世界多输出回归数据集上的实验表明，未正则化模型普遍存在校准问题，而该方法显著改善了所有预排名函数的校准性能，且不牺牲预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为多输出回归提供了有效的多元校准方法，能够显著改善模型校准而不影响预测性能。

Abstract: Probabilistic models must be well calibrated to support reliable
decision-making. While calibration in single-output regression is well studied,
defining and achieving multivariate calibration in multi-output regression
remains considerably more challenging. The existing literature on multivariate
calibration primarily focuses on diagnostic tools based on pre-rank functions,
which are projections that reduce multivariate prediction-observation pairs to
univariate summaries to detect specific types of miscalibration. In this work,
we go beyond diagnostics and introduce a general regularization framework to
enforce multivariate calibration during training for arbitrary pre-rank
functions. This framework encompasses existing approaches such as highest
density region calibration and copula calibration. Our method enforces
calibration by penalizing deviations of the projected probability integral
transforms (PITs) from the uniform distribution, and can be added as a
regularization term to the loss function of any probabilistic predictor.
Specifically, we propose a regularization loss that jointly enforces both
marginal and multivariate pre-rank calibration. We also introduce a new
PCA-based pre-rank that captures calibration along directions of maximal
variance in the predictive distribution, while also enabling dimensionality
reduction. Across 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that
unregularized models are consistently miscalibrated, and that our methods
significantly improve calibration across all pre-rank functions without
sacrificing predictive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合半赌博机问题虽然比经典多臂赌博机更通用且应用广泛，但其可扩展性受到组合优化高成本的限制，需要在每轮进行oracle查询。

Method: 提出oracle高效的框架，包括协方差自适应算法以利用噪声结构改进遗憾，并将方法扩展到一般（非线性）奖励设置。

Result: 将oracle使用从线性减少到（双）对数级别，同时保持强大的理论保证。在worst-case线性奖励下，仅用O(log log T)次oracle查询实现Õ(√T)遗憾。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著降低了组合半赌博机问题的计算成本，使该框架在实际应用中更加可行和可扩展。

Abstract: We study the combinatorial semi-bandit problem where an agent selects a
subset of base arms and receives individual feedback. While this generalizes
the classical multi-armed bandit and has broad applicability, its scalability
is limited by the high cost of combinatorial optimization, requiring oracle
queries at every round. To tackle this, we propose oracle-efficient frameworks
that significantly reduce oracle calls while maintaining tight regret
guarantees. For the worst-case linear reward setting, our algorithms achieve
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret using only $O(\log\log T)$ oracle queries. We also
propose covariance-adaptive algorithms that leverage noise structure for
improved regret, and extend our approach to general (non-linear) rewards.
Overall, our methods reduce oracle usage from linear to (doubly) logarithmic in
time, with strong theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: HollowFlow通过创新的NoBGNN架构和块对角雅可比结构，显著降低了流模型的似然计算复杂度，为实现大规模Boltzmann生成器提供了可行方案，解决了先前受计算瓶颈限制的高维科学问题。

Abstract: Flow and diffusion-based models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific
applications, particularly for sampling non-normalized probability
distributions, as exemplified by Boltzmann Generators (BGs). A critical
challenge in deploying these models is their reliance on sample likelihood
computations, which scale prohibitively with system size $n$, often rendering
them infeasible for large-scale problems. To address this, we introduce
$\textit{HollowFlow}$, a flow-based generative model leveraging a novel
non-backtracking graph neural network (NoBGNN). By enforcing a block-diagonal
Jacobian structure, HollowFlow likelihoods are evaluated with a constant number
of backward passes in $n$, yielding speed-ups of up to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$: a
significant step towards scaling BGs to larger systems. Crucially, our
framework generalizes: $\textbf{any equivariant GNN or attention-based
architecture}$ can be adapted into a NoBGNN. We validate HollowFlow by training
BGs on two different systems of increasing size. For both systems, the sampling
and likelihood evaluation time decreases dramatically, following our
theoretical scaling laws. For the larger system we obtain a $10^2\times$
speed-up, clearly illustrating the potential of HollowFlow-based approaches for
high-dimensional scientific problems previously hindered by computational
bottlenecks.

Abstract: We introduce a highly expressive yet distinctly tractable family for
black-box variational inference (BBVI). Each member of this family is a
weighted product of experts (PoE), and each weighted expert in the product is
proportional to a multivariate $t$-distribution. These products of experts can
model distributions with skew, heavy tails, and multiple modes, but to use them
for BBVI, we must be able to sample from their densities. We show how to do
this by reformulating these products of experts as latent variable models with
auxiliary Dirichlet random variables. These Dirichlet variables emerge from a
Feynman identity, originally developed for loop integrals in quantum field
theory, that expresses the product of multiple fractions (or in our case,
$t$-distributions) as an integral over the simplex. We leverage this simplicial
latent space to draw weighted samples from these products of experts -- samples
which BBVI then uses to find the PoE that best approximates a target density.
Given a collection of experts, we derive an iterative procedure to optimize the
exponents that determine their geometric weighting in the PoE. At each
iteration, this procedure minimizes a regularized Fisher divergence to match
the scores of the variational and target densities at a batch of samples drawn
from the current approximation. This minimization reduces to a convex quadratic
program, and we prove under general conditions that these updates converge
exponentially fast to a near-optimal weighting of experts. We conclude by
evaluating this approach on a variety of synthetic and real-world target
distributions.
