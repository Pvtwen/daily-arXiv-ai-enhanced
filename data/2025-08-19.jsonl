However, such techniques\nare limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed\nsequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown\nbeforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently\n(termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts.\nThis renders existing methods ineffective.

This paper introduces Fed-Meta-Align, a novel four-phase\nframework designed to overcome these limitations through a sophisticated\ninitialization and training pipeline. Our process begins by training a\nfoundational model on a general public dataset to establish a competent\nstarting point. This model then undergoes a serial meta-initialization phase,\nwhere it sequentially trains on a subset of IOT Device data to learn a\nheterogeneity-aware initialization that is already situated in a favorable\nregion of the loss landscape. This informed model is subsequently refined in a\nparallel FL phase, which utilizes a dual-criterion aggregation mechanism that\nweights for IOT devices updates based on both local performance and cosine\nsimilarity alignment. Finally, an on-device personalization phase adapts the\nconverged global model into a specialized expert for each IOT Device.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that Fed-Meta-Align achieves an average\ntest accuracy of 91.27% across heterogeneous IOT devices, outperforming\npersonalized FedAvg and FedProx by up to 3.87% and 3.37% on electrical and\nmechanical fault datasets, respectively. This multi-stage approach of sequenced\ninitialization and adaptive aggregation provides a robust pathway for deploying\nhigh-performance intelligence on diverse TinyML networks."}

To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a\nlightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under\nfew-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that\nfuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively\nreducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance. Then\nwe propose a self-compression module that aggregates each full demonstration\ninto the latent space of the last few linguistic tokens, reducing the average\ndemonstration length from 751 tokens to less than 16 tokens. Compared to the\noriginal ProtTeX, our self-compression approach achieves a compression ratio of\napproximately 93.68% in the total prompt length under the 16-shot setting.\nWithout modifying the backbone model, ProtTeX-CC introduces only a small number\nof additional parameters through PEFT-based tuning in the joint embedding\ncompression stage and a single trainable projection layer in the\nself-compression stage. Extensive experiments on protein function prediction\nshow that ProtTeX-CC improves performance on the in-domain benchmark by 2%, and\ngeneralizes well to the out-of-domain dataset with a performance gain of 11%."}

The field of\neXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) presents promising methods to create\nsuch explanations. But recent reviews about their performance offer reasons for\nskepticism. As we will argue, a good criterion for trustworthiness is\nexplanatory robustness: different XAI methods produce the same explanations in\ncomparable contexts.

We therefore argue that in addition to\nexplanatory robustness (ER), a prior requirement of explanation method\nrobustness (EMR) has to be fulfilled by every XAI method.

This paradigm faces limitations when the\ndesired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe\nanswer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal\nactivity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert\nwhen asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained\nsteering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using\ncontrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts\nrequired for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to\ntrain a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector.\nOur approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces\nhallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static\nbaselines."}

Calibration measures\nquantify how far a predictor is from perfect calibration. As introduced by\nHaghtalab et al. (2024), a calibration measure is truthful if it is minimized\nin expectation when a predictor outputs the ground-truth probabilities.\nAlthough predicting the true probabilities guarantees perfect calibration, in\nreality, when calibration is evaluated on a finite sample, predicting the truth\nis not guaranteed to minimize any known calibration measure. All known\ncalibration measures incentivize predictors to lie in order to appear more\ncalibrated on a finite sample. Such lack of truthfulness motivated Haghtalab et\nal. (2024) and Qiao and Zhao (2025) to construct approximately truthful\ncalibration measures in the sequential prediction setting, but no perfectly\ntruthful calibration measure was known to exist even in the more basic batch\nsetting.\n  We design a perfectly truthful calibration measure in the batch setting:\naveraged two-bin calibration error (ATB). In addition to being truthful, ATB is\nsound, complete, continuous, and quadratically related to two existing\ncalibration measures: the smooth calibration error (smCal) and the (lower)\ndistance to calibration (distCal). The simplicity in our definition of ATB\nmakes it efficient and straightforward to compute. ATB allows faster estimation\nalgorithms with significantly easier implementations than smCal and distCal,\nachieving improved running time and simplicity for the calibration testing\nproblem studied by Hu et al.

We also introduce a general recipe for\nconstructing truthful measures, which proves the truthfulness of ATB as a\nspecial case and allows us to construct other truthful calibration measures\nsuch as quantile-binned l_2-ECE."}

Our approach is computationally fast\nand easy to adopt. When we apply our method to matchups from two popular\nhuman-preference platforms, Chatbot Arena and MT-Bench, we find that the\nBradley--Terry rankings of top-performing models are remarkably sensitive to\nthe removal of a small fraction of evaluations. Our framework also identifies\nthe specific evaluations most responsible for such ranking flips, allowing for\ninspections of these influential preferences. We observe that the rankings\nderived from MT-Bench preferences are notably more robust than those from\nChatbot Arena, likely due to MT-bench's use of expert annotators and carefully\nconstructed prompts. Finally, we find that rankings based on crowdsourced\nhuman-evaluated systems are just as sensitive as those based on LLM-as-a-judge\nevaluations, where in both, dropping as little as 0.02% of the total\nevaluations in the dataset can change the top-ranked model."}

We consider a realistic scenario where\nthe target data is limited in size while the external data is large but\ncontaminated with outliers; such data contamination, along with other\ncomputational and operational constraints, necessitates proper selection or\nsubsampling of the external data for transfer learning. To our\nknowledge,transfer learning and subsampling under data contamination have not\nbeen thoroughly investigated. We address this gap by studying various transfer\nlearning methods with subsamples of the external data, accounting for outliers\ndeviating from the underlying true model due to arbitrary mean shifts. Two\nsubsampling strategies are investigated: one aimed at reducing biases and the\nother at minimizing variances. Approaches to combine these strategies are also\nintroduced to enhance the performance of the estimators. We provide\nnon-asymptotic error bounds for the transfer learning estimators, clarifying\nthe roles of sample sizes, signal strength, sampling rates, magnitude of\noutliers, and tail behaviors of model error distributions, among other factors.\nExtensive simulations show the superior performance of the proposed methods.\nAdditionally, we apply our methods to analyze the risk of hard landings in A380\nairplanes by utilizing data from other airplane types,demonstrating that robust\ntransfer learning can improve estimation efficiency for relatively rare\nairplane types with the help of data from other types of airplanes."}

As the quasi-steady-state distribution depends on the expected cost\nfunction, the KL divergence eventually reveals the connection between the\nexpected cost function and the initialization distribution.
