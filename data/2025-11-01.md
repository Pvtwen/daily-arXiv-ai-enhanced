### [2] [Statistically Adaptive Differential Protection for AC Microgrids Based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26604)
*Shahab Moradi Torkashvand,Arina Kharazi,Emad Sadeghi,Seyed Hossein Hesamedin Sadeghi,Adel Nasiri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Kullback-Leibler散度的统计自适应差动保护方案，用于解决逆变器资源带来的微电网保护挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆变器资源的普及给传统微电网保护带来了挑战，包括变化的故障电流和复杂瞬态过程

Method: 采用Bartlett校正G统计量计算对数变换电流幅值，使用Mahalanobis距离区分健康与故障状态，检测阈值基于卡方分布统计推导

Result: 在改进的CIGRE 14总线微电网上验证，具有亚周期平均检测延迟、高检测分类精度、对250欧姆高阻抗故障的鲁棒性、10ms通信延迟容忍度和20dB信噪比噪声容忍度

Conclusion: 该方法为下一代交流微电网保护提供了可复现且计算高效的解决方案

Abstract: The proliferation of inverter-based resources challenges traditional
microgrid protection by introducing variable fault currents and complex
transients. This paper presents a statistically adaptive differential
protection scheme based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, implemented via a
Bartlett-corrected G-statistic computed on logarithm-transformed current
magnitudes. The method is a multivariate fault detection engine that employs
the Mahalanobis distance to distinguish healthy and faulty states, enabling
robust detection even in noisy environments. Detection thresholds are
statistically derived from a chi-squared distribution for precise control over
the false alarm rate. Upon detection, a lightweight classifier identifies the
fault type by assessing per-phase G-statistics against dedicated thresholds,
enhanced by a temporal persistence filter for security. Extensive simulations
on a modified CIGRE 14-bus microgrid show high efficacy: sub-cycle average
detection delays, high detection and classification accuracy across operating
modes, resilience to high-impedance faults up to 250 Ohms, tolerance to 10 ms
communication delay, and noise levels down to a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio.
These findings demonstrate a reproducible and computationally efficient
solution for next-generation AC microgrid protection.

*Sen Yan,Tianyu Hu,Brahim Mefgouda,Samson Lasaulce,Merouane Debbah*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理指导的轻量级框架，通过相机图像预测无线信号强度，将信号分解为路径损耗和阴影衰落两个物理可解释分量，显著提升了预测精度和环境干扰鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的无线信号预测方法存在计算复杂度高、对环境干扰敏感的问题，需要开发更高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 将接收信号强度指示器分解为路径损耗和阴影衰落两个物理可解释分量，使用基于MobileNet的轻量级模型进行预测。

Result: 在常规条件下将预测均方根误差降低50.3%，在干扰消除条件下仍比先前基准低11.5%的RMSE，模型尺寸比竞争方案小19倍。

Conclusion: 该框架结合了高精度、干扰鲁棒性和计算效率，非常适合在边缘设备上进行实时部署，为更智能可靠的无线通信系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Accurate, real-time wireless signal prediction is essential for
next-generation networks. However, existing vision-based frameworks often rely
on computationally intensive models and are also sensitive to environmental
interference. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, physics-guided
and light-weighted framework that predicts the received signal strength
indicator (RSSI) from camera images. By decomposing RSSI into its physically
interpretable components, path loss and shadow fading, we significantly reduce
the model's learning difficulty and exhibit interpretability. Our approach
establishes a new state-of-the-art by demonstrating exceptional robustness to
environmental interference, a critical flaw in prior work. Quantitatively, our
model reduces the prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) by 50.3% under
conventional conditions and still achieves an 11.5% lower RMSE than the
previous benchmark's interference-eliminated results. This superior performance
is achieved with a remarkably lightweight framework, utilizing a
MobileNet-based model up to 19 times smaller than competing solutions. The
combination of high accuracy, robustness to interference, and computational
efficiency makes our framework highly suitable for real-time, on-device
deployment in edge devices, paving the way for more intelligent and reliable
wireless communication systems.

### [4] [Lightweight Ac Arc Fault Diagnosis via Fourier Transform Inspired Multi-frequency Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26093)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电弧故障诊断方法难以在资源受限条件下同时实现快速响应和鲁棒精度，需要开发轻量级在线检测技术来预防电气火灾。

Method: 基于电弧电流曲线和傅里叶分解分析，设计了具有超强表达能力的自适应激活函数EAS，以及包含分支网络的新型网络架构，帮助MFNN提取多频特征。

Result: 1) MFNN在电弧故障定位方面优于其他模型；2) 在SNR=-9时，MFNN的噪声免疫性比LCNN和BLS分别高出14.51%和16.3%；3) EAS和网络架构对MFNN的优异性能有重要贡献。

Conclusion: MFNN通过将物理知识嵌入神经网络，在电弧故障检测中实现了优越的性能，特别是在噪声环境和定位精度方面表现突出。

Abstract: Lightweight online detection of series arc faults is critically needed in
residential and industrial power systems to prevent electrical fires. Existing
diagnostic methods struggle to achieve both rapid response and robust accuracy
under resource-constrained conditions. To overcome the challenge, this work
suggests leveraging a multi-frequency neural network named MFNN, embedding
prior physical knowledge into the network. Inspired by arcing current curve and
the Fourier decomposition analysis, we create an adaptive activation function
with super-expressiveness, termed EAS, and a novel network architecture with
branch networks to help MFNN extract features with multiple frequencies. In our
experiments, eight advanced arc fault diagnosis models across an experimental
dataset with multiple sampling times and multi-level noise are used to
demonstrate the superiority of MFNN. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The
MFNN outperforms other models in arc fault location, befitting from signal
decomposition of branch networks. 2) The noise immunity of MFNN is much better
than that of other models, achieving 14.51% over LCNN and 16.3% over BLS in
test accuracy when SNR=-9. 3) EAS and the network architecture contribute to
the excellent performance of MFNN.

### [5] [Robust Super-Capacity SRS Channel Inpainting via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26097)
*Usman Akram,Fan Zhang,Yang Li,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于扩散模型的信道修复框架，通过似然梯度项在推理时整合系统模型知识，使单一训练模型能够适应不匹配条件，在5G NR系统中实现鲁棒且可泛化的超容量SRS设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G NR中基于互易性的波束成形面临资源和覆盖限制，需要稀疏非均匀SRS分配。现有MAE方法虽然改善了覆盖，但容易过拟合训练掩码，在未见失真（如额外掩码、干扰、削波、非高斯噪声）下性能下降。

Method: 提出扩散基信道修复框架，在推理时通过似然梯度项整合系统模型知识，使用基于分数的扩散变体，使单一训练模型能够适应不匹配条件。

Result: 在标准化CDL信道上，基于分数的扩散变体在分布偏移下始终优于UNet分数模型基线和一步MAE，在挑战性设置（如拉普拉斯噪声、用户干扰）下NMSE提升高达14 dB，同时在匹配条件下保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 扩散引导的修复是5G NR系统中鲁棒且可泛化的超容量SRS设计的有效方法。

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for reliable multiuser
MIMO operation. In 5G NR, reciprocity-based beamforming via uplink Sounding
Reference Signals (SRS) face resource and coverage constraints, motivating
sparse non-uniform SRS allocation. Prior masked-autoencoder (MAE) approaches
improve coverage but overfit to training masks and degrade under unseen
distortions (e.g., additional masking, interference, clipping, non-Gaussian
noise). We propose a diffusion-based channel inpainting framework that
integrates system-model knowledge at inference via a likelihood-gradient term,
enabling a single trained model to adapt across mismatched conditions. On
standardized CDL channels, the score-based diffusion variant consistently
outperforms a UNet score-model baseline and the one-step MAE under distribution
shift, with improvements up to 14 dB NMSE in challenging settings (e.g.,
Laplace noise, user interference), while retaining competitive accuracy under
matched conditions. These results demonstrate that diffusion-guided inpainting
is a robust and generalizable approach for super-capacity SRS design in 5G NR
systems.

### [6] [Virtual-Real Collaborated Split Learning via Model Partitioning in IRS-Assisted IoT Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26150)
*Jiaying Di,Kunlun Wang,Jing Xu,Wen Chen,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种IRS辅助IoT网络中结合数字孪生技术的大规模分割学习计算通信协同设计框架，通过优化层分割点、DT分配、IRS相位、功率分配和频率调整来最小化端到端延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在IRS辅助的IoT网络中，用户设备计算能力异构且有限，需要设计高效的分布式学习框架来降低训练延迟并提升系统性能。

Method: 采用交替优化方法，结合闭式更新、半定松弛和低复杂度启发式算法，联合优化五个关键变量来解决高度耦合的非凸混合整数问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方案相比传统基线显著降低了训练延迟，在用户设备密度高和功率约束严格的情况下延迟改善可达35%。

Conclusion: 该计算通信协同设计框架能有效提升IRS辅助IoT网络中分割学习的效率，为大规模分布式智能系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel computation and communication co-design
framework for large-scale split learning in intelligent reflecting surface
(IRS)-assisted internet of things (IoT) networks integrated with digital twin
(DT) technique. The considered system consists of a multi-antenna access point
(AP), multiple heterogeneous user devices (UDs), and an deployed IRS to enhance
both uplink and downlink transmission. The training process of a deep neural
network is partitioned between devices and the AP, where a DT replica is
activated to replace UDs with insufficient local computation capabilities. We
formulate a delay-optimal split learning problem, which optimizes five key
variables: layer partitioning points, DT assignment decisions, IRS phase shift
matrix, AP downlink power allocation, and DT frequency adjustment, aiming to
minimize the overall end-to-end delay under communication and computation. The
proposed optimization problem is a highly coupled non-convex mixed-integer
problem. Therefore, we solve using an alternating optimization approach
combining closed-form updates, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and
low-complexity heuristics. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
scheme significantly reduces training delay compared to conventional baselines
and achieves up to 35\% delay improvement, especially under high UD density and
stringent power constraints.

### [7] [6D Channel Knowledge Map Construction via Bidirectional Wireless Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26166)
*Juncong Zhou,Chao Hu,Guanlin Wu,Zixiang Ren,Han Hu,Juyong Zhang,Rui Zhang,Jie Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为双向无线高斯泼溅(BiWGS)的6D信道知识图谱框架，能够建模3D空间中动态发射器和接收器位置的无线信道，显著优于传统MLP方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D/3D信道知识图谱方法假设基站配置固定，无法处理动态变化的发射器和接收器位置，需要开发能够建模6D信道的框架。

Method: 使用高斯椭球表示无线环境中的虚拟散射簇和环境障碍物，通过学习双向散射模式和复杂衰减特性来捕获电磁传输特征。

Result: BiWGS在构建6D信道功率增益图方面显著优于传统多层感知机，在3D信道知识图谱构建方面达到与最先进无线辐射场高斯泼溅相当的频谱预测精度。

Conclusion: BiWGS能够成功实现6D信道知识图谱的维度扩展，同时保持高保真度，为动态无线环境建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the construction of channel knowledge map (CKM) from
sparse channel measurements. Dif ferent from conventional
two-/three-dimensional (2D/3D) CKM approaches assuming fixed base station
configurations, we present a six-dimensional (6D) CKM framework named
bidirectional wireless Gaussian splatting (BiWGS), which is capable of mod
eling wireless channels across dynamic transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx)
positions in 3D space. BiWGS uses Gaussian el lipsoids to represent virtual
scatterer clusters and environmental obstacles in the wireless environment. By
properly learning the bidirectional scattering patterns and complex attenuation
profiles based on channel measurements, these ellipsoids inherently cap ture
the electromagnetic transmission characteristics of wireless environments,
thereby accurately modeling signal transmission under varying transceiver
configurations. Experiment results show that BiWGS significantly outperforms
classic multi-layer perception (MLP) for the construction of 6D channel power
gain map with varying Tx-Rx positions, and achieves spatial spectrum prediction
accuracy comparable to the state-of-the art wireless radiation field Gaussian
splatting (WRF-GS) for 3D CKM construction. This validates the capability of
the proposed BiWGS in accomplishing dimensional expansion of 6D CKM
construction, without compromising fidelity.

### [8] [Optimal transmit field distribution for partially obstructed continuous radiating surfaces in near-field communication systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26262)
*Francesco Verde,Donatella Darsena,Marco Di Renzo,Vincenzo Galdi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在遮挡环境中优化合成孔径场的方法，用于近场通信。通过基于刀边衍射的物理模型，将问题表述为希尔伯特空间中的最大化问题，得到匹配滤波器形式的优化解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在存在障碍物的近场通信环境中，需要开发能够有效聚焦能量的方法，以克服信号衰减和干扰问题。

Method: 使用基于刀边衍射的物理一致模型，将问题表述为希尔伯特空间中的最大化问题，得到匹配衍射诱导核形状的匹配滤波器解。

Result: 获得了最优解作为匹配滤波器，将波传播与信号处理方法联系起来，支持使用超表面或透镜天线等连续孔径的硬件实现。

Conclusion: 该方法在物理建模、信号处理和硬件设计之间建立了桥梁，为遮挡近场信道中的高效能量聚焦提供了解决方案。

Abstract: This paper deals with the optimal synthesis of aperture fields for
(radiating) near-field communications in obstructed environments. A physically
consistent model based on knife-edge diffraction is used to formulate the
problem as a maximization in Hilbert space. The optimal solution is obtained as
a matched filter that ``matches" the shape of a diffraction-induced kernel,
thus linking wave propagation with signal processing methods. The framework
supports hardware implementation using continuous apertures such as
metasurfaces or lens antennas. This approach bridges physically grounded
modeling, signal processing, and hardware design for efficient energy focusing
in near-field obstructed channels.

### [9] [SABER: Symbolic Regression-based Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26340)
*Shih-Kai Chou,Mengran Zhao,Cheng-Nan Hu,Kuang-Chung Chou,Carolina Fortuna,Jernej Hribar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出SABER框架，使用符号回归自动发现可解释的波束模式和AoA闭式模型，在真实RIS辅助室内测试中实现接近零误差的AoA估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统高分辨率技术需要多天线阵列和大量快照采集，以及通用机器学习方法缺乏物理可解释性的问题

Method: 基于符号回归的约束框架，从路径损耗测量中自动发现闭式波束模式和AoA模型，保持物理可解释性

Result: 在自由空间消声室中实现亚0.5度平均绝对误差，在RIS辅助室内测试中实现接近零误差的AoA估计

Conclusion: SABER是可解释且准确的AoA估计方法，填补了不透明ML方法与可解释物理驱动估计器之间的差距

Abstract: Accurate Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation is essential for next-generation
wireless communication systems to enable reliable beamforming, high-precision
localization, and integrated sensing. Unfortunately, classical high-resolution
techniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection,
while generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models
that lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a
Symbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based
Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained
symbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam
pattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER
achieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and
interpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a
controlled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of
the known $\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5
degree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further
reduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that
lack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a
real-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed.
SABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with
near-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cram\'er-Rao Lower
Bounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and
accurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA
estimation.

### [10] [HMM for short independent sequences: Multiple sequence Baum-Welch application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26532)
*Margarita Cabrera-Bean,Josep Vidal,Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin,Albert Roso-Llorach,Concepcion Violan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了针对多独立短序列场景的隐马尔可夫模型训练和解码伪代码，特别适用于人口健康纵向研究中的数据格式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMM训练依赖单个长观测序列，但在人口健康等纵向研究中，数据通常由多个个体的短轨迹组成，需要专门的处理方法。

Method: 开发了针对多独立短序列的HMM训练和解码算法伪代码，扩展了Baum-Welch算法以适应这种数据格式。

Result: 提供了适用于多短序列场景的HMM完整算法框架，包括训练和解码过程。

Conclusion: 该方法为人口健康纵向研究等领域的HMM应用提供了更合适的技术方案，能够有效处理多个体短轨迹数据。

Abstract: In the classical setting, the training of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
typically relies on a single, sufficiently long observation sequence that can
be regarded as representative of the underlying stochastic process. In this
context, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied in its
specialized form for HMMs, namely the Baum Welch algorithm, which has been
extensively employed in applications such as speech recognition. The objective
of this work is to present pseudocode formulations for both the training and
decoding procedures of HMMs in a different scenario, where the available data
consist of multiple independent temporal sequences generated by the same model,
each of relatively short duration, i.e., containing only a limited number of
samples. Special emphasis is placed on the relevance of this formulation to
longitudinal studies in population health, where datasets are naturally
structured as collections of short trajectories across individuals with point
data at follow up.

### [11] [Graph Guided Modulo Recovery of EEG Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26756)
*Soujanya Hazra,Sanjay Ghosh*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出GraphUnwrapNet方法，使用图神经网络从折叠的EEG信号中恢复原始波形，通过预估计引导的特征注入模块提高边界恢复稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号存在显著个体差异，传统采样容易导致信号饱和或失真，模数采样通过折叠信号避免饱和，但恢复原始波形是高度不适定问题。

Method: 将EEG信号表示为有组织的图结构，利用通道和时间连接建立底层依赖关系，引入预估计引导的特征注入模块提供粗略折叠指示器。

Result: 在STEW数据集上的实验表明，相比传统优化技术有持续改进，与当前深度学习模型相比具有竞争性准确度。

Conclusion: 基于图的方法在稳健的模数EEG恢复方面具有潜力，整合结构信息和折叠先验到统一框架中。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) often shows significant variability among
people. This fluctuation disrupts reliable acquisition and may result in
distortion or clipping. Modulo sampling is now a promising solution to this
problem, by folding signals instead of saturating them. Recovery of the
original waveform from folded observations is a highly ill-posed problem. In
this work, we propose a method based on a graph neural network, referred to as
GraphUnwrapNet, for the modulo recovery of EEG signals. Our core idea is to
represent an EEG signal as an organized graph whose channels and temporal
connections establish underlying interdependence. One of our key contributions
is in introducing a pre-estimation guided feature injection module to provide
coarse folding indicators that enhance stability during recovery at wrap
boundaries. This design integrates structural information with folding priors
into an integrated framework. We performed comprehensive experiments on the
Simultaneous Task EEG Workload (STEW) dataset. The results demonstrate
consistent enhancements over traditional optimization techniques and
competitive accuracy relative to current deep learning models. Our findings
emphasize the potential of graph-based methodology for robust modulo EEG
recovery.

### [12] [Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A Bias-Variance Trade-off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722)
*Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar,Nicolò Michelusi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了在异构无线条件下基于过空中联邦学习的随机梯度下降方法，提出了允许结构化模型偏差的新更新机制，并通过非凸功率控制优化来平衡偏差-方差权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OTA-FL设计在异构无线场景下受限于最弱设备且会增大更新方差，而先前对带偏差OTA-FL的分析主要针对凸目标函数，但大多数现代AI模型都是高度非凸的。

Method: 开发了新颖的OTA-FL SGD更新机制，允许结构化、时不变模型偏差，同时促进减少方差更新；提出了基于统计CSI的非凸联合OTA功率控制设计，并开发了高效的逐次凸逼近算法。

Result: 推导了有限时间平稳性界限，明确揭示了偏差-方差权衡；在非凸图像分类任务上的实验验证了该方法通过优化偏差加速收敛，并相比先前OTA-FL基线提高了泛化性能。

Conclusion: 提出的SCA-based设计通过优化偏差加速了收敛，并在异构无线条件下改善了OTA-FL的性能。

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇综述系统性地回顾了Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)的理论基础、架构变体和实现策略，提供了KANs与传统MLPs的对比分析，并介绍了各种基函数选择及其权衡。


<details>

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The
associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review
complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴传感器提供了丰富的生理时间序列数据，但预测效用的基本原则尚不清楚。作者假设时间分辨率是表示学习的基本维度，不同的临床和行为结果依赖于不同尺度的结构。

Method: 引入HiMAE（分层掩码自编码器），结合掩码自编码与分层卷积编码器-解码器的自监督框架，生成多分辨率嵌入，将分辨率从超参数转变为可解释性探针。

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted
access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward
high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property
predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy
that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable
representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes
the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%
validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto
coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of
framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super
explosives higher than 9 km/s predicted detonation velocity.

TL;DR: 本文研究了思维链监督对transformer模型学习动态的影响，发现CoT能加速泛化但不能克服高算法复杂度任务，并揭示了训练过程中推理轨迹与答案的对齐过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然思维链监督能显著提升transformer性能，但模型如何学习遵循和受益于CoT的机制仍不清楚，需要系统研究其学习动态。

Method: 在符号推理任务上预训练transformer，通过可调算法复杂度和可控数据组成来研究泛化，比较仅输出最终答案和输出CoT轨迹两种设置，使用三参数逻辑曲线建模学习动态。

Result: CoT能加速泛化但对高复杂度任务无效；模型早期会出现推理轨迹不忠实现象（答案正确但推理步骤错误），后期才对齐；CoT会机制性地改变transformer内部计算。

Conclusion: CoT监督通过改变模型内部计算机制来加速学习，但无法克服根本的算法复杂度限制；推理忠实性是动态发展的特性，需要在整个训练过程中监控。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个理论框架来分析和纠正多智能体系统中的系统性偏差，引入了可学习性比率的概念来判断偏差学习是否值得，并开发了ABLOC算法来实现理论性能界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多智能体系统在环境监测、金融预测和众包平台等应用中，由于随环境条件变化的系统性偏差而导致性能显著下降。现有方法要么忽略这些偏差导致次优决策，要么需要昂贵的校准程序。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架，将偏差分解为可学习的系统性成分和不可约的随机成分，引入可学习性比率概念。提出了ABLOC算法，通过迭代学习偏差校正变换和优化组合权重来逼近理论性能界限。

Result: 实验验证表明，具有高可学习性比率的系统可以恢复显著性能（在示例中实现了理论最大改进的40%-70%），而低可学习性比率的系统获益有限，验证了诊断标准的实用性。

Conclusion: 可学习性比率从根本上限制了可实现的性能改进，为系统设计者提供了何时投资于偏差学习与采用更简单方法的定量指导。ABLOC算法能够保证收敛到这些理论界限。

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模拟的强化学习方法来解决拼车系统中的短视决策问题，通过时空状态值学习和空闲车辆重平衡策略，显著提升了服务率并减少了乘客等待时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拼车服务虽然能降低成本和环境影响，但现有系统存在短视决策的局限性，忽视了调度决策的长期影响。

Method: 将Xu等人(2018)的学习和规划框架从网约车扩展到拼车系统，在learning机制中嵌入拼车模拟以实现非短视决策，并提出空闲车辆重平衡策略，采用n步时序差分学习从模拟经验中获取时空状态值。

Result: 非短视匹配策略相比短视策略可将服务率提升高达8.4%，同时减少乘客车内和等待时间；相比短视策略，可在保持相同性能水平下减少25%以上车队规模；结合重平衡操作可进一步将等待时间减少27.3%，车内时间减少12.5%，服务率提升15.1%。

Conclusion: 所提出的非短视决策框架能显著提升拼车系统性能，为运营商提供显著的成本节约，但重平衡操作会增加每乘客车辆行驶时间。

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

TL;DR: MemEIC是一种用于大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)的持续组合知识编辑方法，通过混合外部-内部编辑器和双LoRA适配器实现视觉和文本知识的组合编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑技术通常只关注单一模态(视觉或语言)，忽视了LVLMs的多模态特性和知识更新的连续性，导致编辑效果不佳。

Method: 采用混合外部-内部编辑器，包含用于跨模态证据检索的双外部记忆和用于模态解耦参数更新的双LoRA适配器，以及受大脑启发的知识连接器进行组合推理。

Result: 实验表明MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上显著提升性能，并能有效保留先前的编辑结果。

Conclusion: MemEIC为LVLMs中的持续组合知识编辑设立了新的基准。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Motivation: 时间序列数据的自相关性给多变量时间序列预测带来持续挑战。研究者们观察到神经网络中的频谱偏差现象，但往往将其归因于特定架构设计，而非模型的普遍特性。

Method: 通过广泛的实证实验测量现有主流模型中的频谱偏差，并提出FreLE算法，通过显式和隐式频率正则化来增强模型泛化能力。这是一个即插即用的模型损失函数单元。

Result: 实验发现几乎所有模型都表现出频谱偏差现象。大量实验证明了FreLE的优越性能。

Conclusion: 频谱偏差是时间序列预测模型的普遍特性，FreLE算法能有效缓解此问题并提升模型性能。

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于SFT的冷启动方法将推理范式与任务解决方案和输出格式交织在一起，可能导致指令式过拟合，削弱分布外泛化能力，并最终影响下游强化学习。

Method: SPECS框架：1) 通过自蒸馏生成内省偏好数据对；2) 进行基于偏好的训练，专注于浅层、可转移的表面形式标准；3) 移交到具有可验证奖励的强化学习进行深度推理。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，SPECS框架相比强基线获得一致性能提升，MEGA-Bench提高4.1%，MathVista提高12.2%，同时减少分布内"卡顿"、改善探索、稳定训练并提高性能上限。

Conclusion: 基于偏好的训练方法在冷启动中比SFT方法具有更好的泛化能力，SPECS的解耦学习框架通过分离多模态学习，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Method: 采用分层路由门控网络，从16个专家网络中动态选择4个路由专家，同时集成2个共享专家来捕捉PDE的共性特征，最终输出为所有激活专家的加权平均。

Result: 在6个公共PDE数据集上预训练30M到0.5B参数的模型，90M激活参数的模型相比120M激活参数的现有模型零样本误差降低40%。

Conclusion: MoE架构在PDE问题上具有有效性和合理性，路由门控网络决策能够推断数据集类型，验证了该架构的设计理念。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

Motivation: 黑盒LLMs因其强大性能被广泛使用，但内部参数不可访问。现有方法使用白盒LLMs从优化的软提示生成候选指令，但存在多对一映射导致冗余查询的问题。

Method: PRESTO框架包含三个关键组件：分数共享（与原像中所有软提示共享评估分数）、原像初始化（使用原像信息最大化搜索空间覆盖）、分数一致性正则化（强制原像内预测一致性）。

Result: 在33个指令优化任务上的实验结果表明，PRESTO实现了优越性能，在相同查询预算下有效获得14倍评分数据。

Conclusion: 通过重新解释多对一映射为有用的先验知识，PRESTO框架成功利用软提示的原像结构，显著提高了黑盒LLMs指令优化的效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

Conclusion: ScaleDiff是一个模型无关的高效框架，能够无需额外训练扩展预训练扩散模型的分辨率。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.

Motivation: 尽管InfoNCE目标在对比表示学习中很流行，但它与互信息的间接联系使其不能作为有效的互信息估计器，需要改进。

Method: 引入辅助锚点类，实现一致的密度比估计，并通过适当评分规则推广框架，统一了NCE、InfoNCE和f-散度变体等对比目标。

learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了π_RL框架，用于在并行仿真中训练基于流的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过两种强化学习算法解决迭代去噪过程中动作对数似然难以计算的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然最近工作探索使用强化学习来自动化监督微调的数据收集过程，但将大规模RL应用于基于流的VLA模型仍然具有挑战性，因为迭代去噪导致难以计算动作对数似然。

Method: π_RL框架实现两种RL算法：(1) Flow-Noise将去噪过程建模为离散时间MDP，使用可学习的噪声网络进行精确对数似然计算；(2) Flow-SDE将去噪与智能体-环境交互集成，构建两层MDP，采用ODE到SDE转换实现高效RL探索。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，π_RL将少样本SFT模型π_0和π_0.5的性能分别从57.6%提升到97.6%和从77.1%提升到98.3%。在ManiSkill中，在320个并行环境中训练，将π_0从41.6%提升到85.7%，π_0.5从40.0%提升到84.8%，涵盖4352个拾取放置任务。

Conclusion: π_RL实现了显著的性能提升和比SFT模型更强的泛化能力，验证了在线强化学习对于基于流的VLA模型的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

### [29] [Implicit Bias of Per-sample Adam on Separable Data: Departure from the Full-batch Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26303)
*Beomhan Baek,Minhak Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了增量Adam优化器在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差，发现其与全批次Adam的ℓ∞-最大间隔偏差不同，增量Adam可能收敛到ℓ2-最大间隔分类器。同时证明了Signum优化器在任何批次大小下都收敛到ℓ∞-最大间隔分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam是深度学习中最常用的优化器，但其理论理解仍然有限。先前分析表明Adam偏好ℓ∞-几何的解，但这些结果仅限于全批次情况。本文旨在研究增量Adam（每步使用一个样本）在线性可分数据上的隐式偏差。

Method: 对于线性可分数据的逻辑回归，构造结构化数据集来证明增量Adam收敛到ℓ2-最大间隔分类器。开发代理算法捕捉β2→1时增量Adam的极限行为，并通过数据依赖的双重定点公式表征其收敛方向。

Result: 增量Adam的隐式偏差可能偏离全批次Adam的ℓ∞-最大间隔偏差，在特定结构化数据集上收敛到ℓ2-最大间隔分类器。Signum优化器在任何批次大小下都收敛到ℓ∞-最大间隔分类器。

Conclusion: Adam的隐式偏差关键取决于批次方案和数据集，而Signum保持不变。这强调了优化器选择需要同时考虑批次大小和数据集特性。

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于图拓扑的主动学习方法，使用平衡福尔曼曲率构建核心集指导探索，动态切换探索与利用阶段，并通过局部图重连策略提升标签传播效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在标签预算稀缺情况下主动学习中探索与利用的核心挑战，替代手动调优的启发式方法。

Method: 基于平衡福尔曼曲率的核心集构建算法，包含数据驱动的停止准则；使用BFC动态触发探索到利用的切换；引入局部图重连策略整合多尺度信息。

Result: 在基准分类任务上，该方法在低标签率下持续优于现有的基于图的半监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的图拓扑方法有效解决了主动学习中的探索-利用平衡问题，在标签稀缺情况下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

### [31] [Posterior Sampling by Combining Diffusion Models with Annealed Langevin Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26324)
*Zhiyang Xun,Shivam Gupta,Eric Price*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合扩散模型和退火Langevin动力学的条件采样方法，能够在多项式时间内从后验分布中采样，仅需对分数误差施加L^4约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后验采样在图像修复、去模糊和MRI重建等任务中具有重要应用，但近似后验采样在计算上通常是难解的。现有方法如Langevin动力学对分数估计误差敏感，需要更强的误差约束。

Method: 结合扩散模型与退火Langevin动力学，在log-concave分布假设下进行条件采样。该方法仅需对分数误差施加L^4约束，相比传统方法要求的MGF约束更宽松。

Result: 证明了该方法能够在多项式时间内实现条件采样，仅需L^4分数误差约束，显著降低了计算复杂度要求。

Conclusion: 该方法为后验采样提供了更高效实用的解决方案，在保持理论保证的同时降低了实现难度。

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

TL;DR: LLMs can act as in-context meta-learners for model and hyperparameter selection by converting datasets into metadata and prompting LLMs to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without expensive search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search. The paper investigates whether LLMs can serve as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for this task.

Method: Two prompting strategies: (1) zero-shot mode relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) meta-informed mode augmented with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Convert each dataset into interpretable metadata for LLM prompting.

Result: Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search. Meta-informed prompting shows improvements, demonstrating LLMs' capacity for in-context meta-learning.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as promising lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization, highlighting a new role for LLMs in machine learning workflows.

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and

*Kianoosh Ashouritaklimi,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出在主动学习过程中使用任务驱动的动态表示，而不是固定的无监督表示，以更好地处理混乱、未筛选的数据池。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动学习方法在处理混乱数据池时效果有限，因为它们依赖固定的无监督表示，无法捕捉与目标任务相关的重要信息。

Method: 提出两种策略：直接学习半监督表示，以及对初始无监督表示进行监督微调，在主动学习过程中定期更新表示。

Result: 两种策略都显著优于使用无监督或预训练表示的方法，在实证性能上有明显提升。

Conclusion: 在主动学习过程中使用任务驱动的动态表示能有效提高处理混乱数据池的性能。

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度网络中捷径学习（shortcut learning）的层间分布特征，发现捷径学习并非集中在特定层，而是分布在整个网络中，浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层主要遗忘核心特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捷径（spurious rules）是深度网络训练中表现良好但泛化能力差的问题，但目前对捷径如何影响特征表示的研究不足，阻碍了设计有效的捷径缓解方法。

Method: 通过反事实训练设计，在干净和偏斜数据集上量化各层对由捷径引起的准确率下降的贡献，在CIFAR-10、Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上使用VGG、ResNet、DeiT和ConvNeXt架构进行研究。

Result: 发现捷径学习分布在整个网络中，浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层主要遗忘核心特征，并分析了定位差异的主要变化轴。

Conclusion: 层间捷径缓解策略的分析表明设计通用方法很困难，支持采用数据集和架构特定的方法。

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN水印方法依赖后门触发器，容易受到常见模型编辑的影响并产生所有权模糊问题，需要更可靠的水印方案。

Method: 使用轻量级头部预测所有者私有载体集的归一化代数连通性，通过符号敏感解码器输出比特，并采用校准阈值控制误报率。

Result: 在多种节点和图分类数据集及骨干网络上，InvGNN-WM保持清洁准确率的同时，水印准确率高于基于触发器和压缩的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法对非结构化剪枝、微调和训练后量化具有强鲁棒性，证明了不可感知性和鲁棒性保证，且精确移除是NP完全问题。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准延迟算法训练需要查询所有专家，成本过高，违背了延迟的核心目标——限制不必要的专家使用

Method: 为两阶段和单阶段多专家延迟设置提出新算法，选择性查询训练样本的部分专家，平衡成本与预测性能

Result: 理论分析提供泛化界和标签复杂度保证，多个领域的实证结果显示能显著降低训练成本而不牺牲预测精度

Conclusion: 预算感知延迟算法具有实际价值，能在不牺牲准确性的前提下大幅减少专家查询成本

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

Motivation: 传统哈希或独热编码方法在高基数分类标识符编码中存在信息丢失或维度爆炸问题，需要一种既能保持双射映射又具有计算可扩展性的编码技术。

Method: 利用有限域上的模运算和可逆线性变换，实现高基数分类标识符的可逆确定性编码，可显式控制维度并保持完全可逆性。

Result: 在MovieLens 20M数据集上的实验结果显示，MLT在预测性能上与监督嵌入方法相当，但参数数量显著减少，训练成本更低。

Conclusion: MLT提供了一种高效、可扩展且完全可逆的分类标识符编码方法，在保持性能的同时大幅降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对Transformer参数记忆的几何视角，挑战了传统的关联记忆观点。研究发现模型会自发形成几何结构来编码全局实体关系，即使在没有优化压力的情况下也会出现这种优雅的几何表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，序列建模中的参数记忆被抽象为实体共现的暴力查找。作者希望探索记忆是否能够形成几何结构来编码全局关系，包括非共现实体之间的关系。

Method: 通过分析Transformer推理的实例，发现其行为与纯粹基于训练时局部共现的记忆存储不相容。然后通过连接Node2Vec分析，证明几何结构源于谱偏置，即使缺乏各种优化压力也会自然出现。

Result: 模型能够将困难的推理任务简化为易于学习的一步几何任务。研究发现优雅的几何表示会在没有优化压力的情况下自发形成，且这种几何结构并不比暴力查找关联更简洁。

Conclusion: 参数记忆的几何视角鼓励重新审视知识获取、容量、发现和遗忘等领域的研究直觉。分析还指出了使Transformer记忆更加几何化的可见改进空间。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低收入和中等收入国家的常规健康数据存在报告延迟和覆盖不全的问题，需要探索新的数据源和分析方法来提高数据可靠性。

Method: 使用XGBoost模型，基于552个健康服务区的数据（2021年1月-2023年5月），评估Google人口动态基础模型、Google AlphaEarth卫星图像和移动电话CDR三种GeoFM嵌入源，并与传统地理插值方法比较。

Result: 基于嵌入的方法在15个指标中的13个（87%）优于基线地理统计方法。多源GeoFM模型表现最稳健，在人口密度、新HIV病例和儿童疫苗接种等指标上取得良好预测效果，但对结核病和营养不良等数据稀缺目标的预测效果较差。

Conclusion: GeoFM嵌入为LMIC环境中的特定健康和人口指标提供了适度的预测改进，多源GeoFM整合是补充和加强受限常规健康信息系统的有效工具。

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic

similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,

TL;DR: DiffOpt.jl是一个统一建模和微分的Julia优化框架，通过KKT系统计算前向和反向模式解及目标灵敏度，支持光滑非凸规划，提供参数中心API简化导数计算。


<details>

Motivation: 解决约束优化问题微分在机器学习、控制和决策系统中的集成挑战，克服求解器专业化和接口不匹配问题。

Method: 在标准正则性假设下对KKT系统进行微分，计算前向和反向模式解及目标灵敏度，提供JuMP原生参数中心API。

Result: 框架在凸和非凸模型上验证有效，包括经济调度、投资组合优化和机器人逆运动学，并在大规模应用中展示影响力。

Conclusion: 可微优化可以作为实验、学习、校准和设计的常规工具，无需偏离标准JuMP建模实践，同时保持对广泛求解器生态系统的访问。

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

TL;DR: PCN-TA通过时间摊销技术保留潜在状态，利用时间相关性显著降低计算需求，在COIL-20数据集上比反向传播减少10%权重更新，比基线PC网络减少50%推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘机器人系统需要高效的在线学习算法来持续适应变化环境，传统反向传播在生物合理性方面存在不足，预测编码框架虽然生物合理但计算开销大。

Method: 提出预测编码网络时间摊销(PCN-TA)方法，通过跨时间帧保留潜在状态，利用时间相关性来减少计算需求。

Result: 在COIL-20机器人感知数据集上，PCN-TA比反向传播减少10%权重更新，比基线PC网络减少50%推理步骤，显著降低计算开销。

Conclusion: PCN-TA为资源受限的机器人系统提供了高效的在线学习方案，其生物启发特性使其成为未来神经形态硬件实现的有力候选。

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

Method: INFEX框架按预定调度执行基础探索策略，在探索间隔期间主要选择贪婪动作，可无缝集成任何完全自适应探索方法

Result: 理论分析表明，只要探索频率超过对数阈值，INFEX就能实现与标准高效算法相当的实例依赖遗憾，实证评估显示其具有最先进的遗憾性能和运行时改进

Conclusion: INFEX是一个简单实用的稀疏探索框架，在保持理论性能的同时显著减少探索频率和计算成本，适用于安全关键和成本敏感的应用场景

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

Motivation: 生存分析需要同时建模患者异质性、个体特征和时间动态，现有方法难以灵活整合这些因素。

Method: 使用双重MoE框架：特征编码器MoE用于亚组感知表示学习，风险MoE利用患者特征和时间嵌入捕捉时间动态。

Result: 在METABRIC和GBSG乳腺癌数据集上，时间依赖性C指数在测试集上提升高达0.04，与Consurv框架结合时获得进一步增益。

Conclusion: 双重MoE框架能有效整合患者异质性和时间动态，显著提升生存分析性能，并能灵活与现有深度学习生存分析管道集成。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Conclusion: 符号回归性能主要可由计算量预测，这些发现为训练下一代符号回归模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

<details>

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在固定几何空间中搜索最优参数，限制了模型的表达能力。本文旨在通过动态几何结构来增强模型的表达能力和泛化性能。

Method: 构建变分框架，损失函数平衡数据保真度和流形内在几何复杂度；使用离散微分几何方法，将连续流形离散化为三角网格，通过边长度参数化度量张量，利用自动微分工具进行高效优化。

Result: 理论分析揭示了该框架与广义相对论中爱因斯坦-希尔伯特作用的深刻类比，为"数据驱动几何"概念提供了优雅的物理解释；即使固定拓扑，度量优化也比固定几何模型具有更强的表达能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建能够自主演化几何和拓扑的完全动态"元学习器"奠定了坚实基础，在科学模型发现和鲁棒表示学习等领域具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

Motivation: 传统LLM结构缺乏由任务信息引导的专门记忆机制，无法在保持广泛能力的同时在目标领域达到专家级性能。

Method: 提出Nirvana模型，包含任务感知记忆触发器（Trigger）和专门记忆更新器（Updater）。Trigger基于当前任务需求灵活调整记忆机制，将每个输入样本视为自监督微调任务；Updater在Trigger引导下动态记忆上下文。

Conclusion: Nirvana通过专门的记忆机制成功实现了专业化通用模型的目标，在保持广泛能力的同时在特定领域达到专家级性能，证明了任务引导记忆机制的有效性。

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

Motivation: 传统基于补丁的bug二分查找方法存在多个显著障碍：假设bug引入提交和补丁提交修改相同函数、仅依赖代码变更而忽略提交消息中的漏洞信息、基于简单启发式方法缺乏逻辑分析。

Method: 设计了一个全面的多阶段流程，利用LLM：(1)充分利用补丁信息，(2)在上下文中比较多个候选提交，(3)通过一系列筛选步骤逐步缩小候选范围。

Result: 评估显示该方法比最先进解决方案的准确率提高超过38%，多阶段流程相比基线LLM二分查找方法准确率提高60%。

Conclusion: LLM能够突破现有解决方案的障碍，多阶段管道对于准确识别bug引入提交至关重要。

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

TL;DR: 提出两种基于多智能体强化学习的动态车辆路由方法：自适应导航(AN)和分层枢纽自适应导航(HHAN)，用于解决城市交通拥堵问题，在合成网格和真实城市地图上显著减少平均旅行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最短路径优先算法在动态多车辆环境中表现不佳，往往因将所有车辆引导到相同路径而加剧拥堵，需要开发能够协调车队导航的网络感知路由方法。

Method: AN使用分散式MARL模型，每个交叉口智能体基于本地交通和图注意力网络建模的邻域状态提供路由指导；HHAN扩展AN，仅在关键枢纽分配智能体，车辆在智能体控制下进行枢纽间路由，枢纽内使用SPF微路由，采用集中训练分散执行的A-QMIX框架进行枢纽协调。

Result: AN相比SPF和学习基线减少了平均旅行时间，保持100%路由成功率；HHAN可扩展到数百个交叉口的网络，在重交通条件下实现高达15.9%的改进。

Conclusion: 网络约束的MARL在智能交通系统中具有实现可扩展、协调和拥堵感知路由的潜力。

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中，LTE比GRPO在Pass@1上平均提升6.38，在Pass@k上平均提升9.00。

Conclusion: LTE成功缓解了探索停滞问题，增强了训练过程中的利用和探索能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

TL;DR: maxVSTAR是一个视觉引导的WiFi CSI活动识别模型自适应框架，通过跨模态师生架构实现边缘设备上的自主领域适应，解决环境变化导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WiFi CSI活动识别在边缘设备部署时面临领域偏移问题，环境变化导致识别性能严重下降，需要一种无需人工干预的自主适应方法。

Method: 提出跨模态师生架构，使用高精度YOLO视觉模型作为动态监督信号，为CSI数据流提供实时活动标签，在线微调轻量级CSI HAR模型STAR。

Result: 在未校准硬件上，基线STAR模型准确率从93.52%降至49.14%，经过一次视觉引导适应后，maxVSTAR将准确率恢复至81.51%。

Conclusion: maxVSTAR证明了在隐私保护物联网环境中动态自监督模型适应的能力，为边缘CSI感知的长期自主活动识别建立了可扩展实用范例。

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart
homes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods
often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited
feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and
pervasive computing environments.

<details>

Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉分子与其描述之间的细微差异，缺乏学习分子子结构与化学短语之间细粒度对齐的能力。

Method: 通过分子子结构和化学短语的额外对齐信号增强原始分子-描述对，采用子结构感知对比学习和自精炼机制来过滤噪声对齐信号。

Result: MolBridge在多种分子基准测试中有效捕捉细粒度对应关系，并优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 子结构感知对齐在分子-文本学习中具有重要意义，MolBridge框架展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Motivation: 研究复杂特征工程和混合模型架构在工业多变量时间序列异常检测中的有效性，特别是针对蒸汽轮机系统。

Method: 评估了变化点衍生的统计特征、基于聚类的子结构表示和混合学习策略，并与简单的随机森林+XGBoost集成模型在分段数据上的表现进行比较。

Result: 复杂方法表现不佳，而简单集成模型实现了0.976的AUC-ROC、0.41的F1分数，并在定义的时间窗口内实现了100%的早期检测。

Conclusion: 在数据高度不平衡且时间不确定的场景下，模型简单性结合优化分段可以胜过更复杂的架构，提供更好的鲁棒性、可解释性和操作实用性。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater
robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共资源分配方法独立优化单个资源移动，忽略了容量约束，无法处理现实场景中的时空动态特性。

Method: 将CPRA问题建模为势博弈，证明势函数与最优目标无间隙，设计了GSTRL框架来捕捉系统时空动态并近似纳什均衡。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，GSTRL框架表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: GSTRL框架为协作公共资源分配问题提供了有效的解决方案，能够处理容量约束和时空动态特性。

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准SGD-IE方法忽略了跨训练周期的复合效应，导致对关键样本的影响估计不准确，需要更精确的逐样本影响估计方法。

Method: ACC-SGD-IE是一种轨迹感知估计器，在训练过程中传播留一扰动，并在每个步骤更新累积影响状态。

Result: 在平滑强凸设置中实现几何误差收缩，在平滑非凸机制中收紧误差界限；经验验证在多个数据集上提供更准确的影响估计，特别是在长周期训练中。

Conclusion: ACC-SGD-IE在数据清洗任务中能更可靠地标记噪声样本，使用该方法清洗数据训练的模型性能优于使用SGD-IE清洗的模型。

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

Motivation: 降低可预防的医院再入院率是医疗支付方、提供者和政策制定者的国家优先事项，旨在提高医疗质量并降低成本。

Method: 使用逻辑回归、随机森林和支持向量机分析健康索赔数据，采用主成分分析进行降维，基于AUC指标评估模型性能。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，其次是逻辑回归和支持向量机模型，能够识别导致再入院的关键因素。

Conclusion: 这些模型可用于识别再入院的关键因素，帮助确定需要重点关注的患者，从而降低再入院风险，最终减少成本并提高医疗质量。

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

Result: AISP在样本使用效率上优于最佳n采样，在奖励方面超过了其他基于奖励的测试时对齐方法。

Conclusion: AISP是一种有效的测试时对齐方法，能够在无需微调的情况下实现高性能的对齐效果。

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器学习遗忘方法通常强调理论公式或优化目标，但在实际部署中面临可扩展性问题，需要完全访问原始数据集和模型。本文旨在解决这些实际挑战。

Method: 将分类训练视为顺序学习过程，通过反转最后的训练序列来实现遗忘。在模型末端添加投影-重分布层，该方法不需要访问原始数据集或完整模型。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-10/100使用CNN模型，Covertype使用树模型）上的实验表明，该方法输出与完全重新训练的模型相似，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在实际环境中具有适用性、可扩展性和系统兼容性，同时保持输出性能，为机器学习遗忘提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的行为调控方法（如向量加法和方向消融）受限于二维子空间，对参数选择敏感且可能影响无关特征，需要更灵活稳定的调控方法。

Method: 将行为调控建模为几何旋转，在固定二维子空间内旋转激活向量朝向或远离目标行为方向，并提出了自适应版本仅旋转与目标特征对齐的激活。

Result: 在多个模型家族和规模上的实验表明，Angular Steering实现了稳健的行为控制，同时保持了通用语言建模性能，比现有方法更灵活、泛化性更强、更稳健。

Conclusion: Angular Steering将现有加法和正交化技术统一到几何旋转框架下，简化了参数选择，在更广泛的调整范围内保持了模型稳定性，为安全可靠的AI部署提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

*Ziliang Chen,Tianang Xiao,Jusheng Zhang,Yongsen Zheng,Xipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于token感知的因果表示学习框架，解释了CLIP模型在组合推理方面的脆弱性，证明了存在伪最优文本编码器能够实现完美的模态不变对齐，但对原子概念的交换、替换和添加操作不敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型虽然在跨模态泛化方面表现良好，但在对象、属性和关系的组合推理方面持续失败，表现为类似词袋匹配器的行为。现有因果解释通常将文本建模为单个向量，掩盖了token级别的结构，无法解释提示敏感性和硬负例失败等核心现象。

Method: 提出了一个基于序列化语言token结构因果模型(SCM)的token感知因果表示学习框架，将块可识别性扩展到token化文本，证明CLIP的对比目标可以在句子级和token级SCM下恢复模态不变潜变量。

Result: 理论分析揭示了CLIP组合脆弱性的第一个原则性解释：组合不可识别性。证明了存在伪最优文本编码器，虽然实现了完美的模态不变对齐，但对原子概念的SWAP、REPLACE和ADD操作不敏感，无法区分正确标题和硬负例。

Conclusion: 该分析通过模态间隙将语言侧不可识别性与视觉侧失败联系起来，展示了迭代组合操作如何增加难度，为改进负例挖掘策略提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种数据无关的持续学习方法，通过模型反演生成伪数据来避免存储历史数据，解决了传统持续学习中的隐私和存储问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习需要存储和重放历史数据，但在隐私保护或安全约束下不可行。数据无关的持续学习旨在不访问先前数据的情况下更新模型。

Method: 提出分层模型反演(PMI)方法，通过单层优化提供良好的初始化，减少计算开销；同时使用高斯分布和对比模型建模类特征，确保合成特征与真实特征对齐。

Result: 该方法能够通过生成语义感知的投影特征来生成伪图像，在多个持续学习设置中实现了良好的效果和兼容性。

Conclusion: 结合PMI和特征建模的方法为数据无关的持续学习提供了有效的解决方案，特别适用于大型预训练模型如CLIP。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了使用量子退火训练支持向量机(SVM)的方法，发现即使使用低精度QUBO编码(如1比特参数)也能获得与经典方法相当的分类性能，且选择正确的支持向量比参数精确加权更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索量子退火在SVM训练中的应用潜力，特别是研究量子比特数量(与对偶权重离散化水平相关)如何影响预测性能。

Method: 将SVM训练表示为QUBO问题，使用量子退火进行模型优化，比较不同比特深度的QUBO编码与经典LIBSVM求解器的性能。

Result: 低精度QUBO编码(如1比特参数)能产生具有竞争力甚至更优的分类精度；增加比特深度虽然允许更大的正则化参数，但并不总是改善分类性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明量子退火在SVM训练中具有潜力，选择正确的支持向量比精确权重更重要，随着量子设备规模的扩大，这种方法将更具优势。

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了前沿LLM公司推出的Agent Skills框架存在严重安全漏洞，能够通过简单的提示注入攻击窃取敏感数据，并绕过系统级防护机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Agent Skills框架为LLM持续学习提供了新方法，但作者发现该框架存在根本性的安全缺陷，需要揭示其脆弱性以促进安全改进。

Method: 通过在长Agent Skill文件和引用脚本中隐藏恶意指令，演示如何窃取内部文件和密码等敏感数据，并展示如何利用"不再询问"选项绕过防护机制。

Result: 成功证明了Agent Skills框架容易受到提示注入攻击，能够有效窃取敏感信息并绕过现有安全防护措施。

Conclusion: 尽管研究不断推进且模型能力持续扩展，前沿LLM在现实场景中仍然容易受到简单提示注入攻击，需要更强的安全防护机制。

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的因果发现概念——干预约束，用于编码因果知识的不等式约束，通过约束优化方法确保学习到的因果模型符合已知的因果影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法只能强制执行结构约束，但可能产生与已知因果效应相矛盾的结论。需要一种能够明确约束变量间总因果效应的方法，确保模型与已建立的因果知识一致。

Method: 提出干预约束概念，为线性因果模型设计量化总因果效应的度量，并构建为约束优化问题，采用两阶段约束优化方法求解。

Result: 在真实数据集上的评估表明，整合干预约束不仅提高了模型准确性，确保与已有发现的一致性，还促进了原本难以发现的新的因果关系的发现。

Conclusion: 干预约束填补了因果发现中的重要空白，通过编码高级因果知识使模型更可解释，并为设计新治疗等下游任务提供了更可靠的因果模型。

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法在随机和非平稳环境中表现受限，特别是在奖励稀疏的环境中（如自主水下车辆搜索污染云），需要改进以适应这些复杂条件。

Method: 系统地研究了多种修改方法，包括分层算法变化、多目标学习，以及集成位置记忆作为外部输出过滤器以防止状态重复访问，采用改进的蒙特卡洛方法。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法可以有效适应随机、非平稳和奖励稀疏的环境，为复杂应用场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法仅支持同一模型家族的变体，无法处理根本不同的网络类型（如CNN、GNN、MLP），且忽视了测试时域差异问题。

Method: 使用共享GNN参数化所有架构，通过客户端参数欧氏距离进行聚类，采用双层聚合策略平衡收敛性和多样性。

Result: 在MedMNIST分类和海马体分割基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: UnifiedFL能有效处理联邦学习中的架构异质性和域差异问题，提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

Conclusion: 通过整合预测性能、可靠性估计和基于规则的推理，该框架推进了透明且可审计的金融AI系统。

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

Conclusion: CorVS方法能够有效解决工业环境中的人员识别问题，通过结合视觉追踪和传感器数据，在真实世界条件下实现可靠的人员定位。

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平流层突然增温(SSW)是次季节可预报性的关键来源和极端冬季天气的主要驱动因素，但数值天气预报系统在物理表示、初始化和计算需求方面存在限制，数据驱动方法在复杂三维SSW动力学中的应用仍待探索。

Method: 开发基于流匹配的生成AI模型FM-Cast，用于平流层环流时空演变的概率预报，通过理想化实验分析SSW可预报性与物理驱动因素的关系。

Result: 在18个主要SSW事件(1998-2024)评估中，FM-Cast能提前20天准确预测10个事件的开始、强度和形态，集合准确率超过50%，性能媲美或超越领先的NWP系统，在消费级GPU上仅需2分钟完成50成员、30天的预报。

Conclusion: 建立了计算高效的平流层异常概率预报范式，展示了生成AI在加深对大气-气候动力学物理理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Conclusion: 提出的自适应上下文长度优化框架能有效提升MARL在复杂环境中的性能，解决了固定上下文长度带来的探索效率和信息冗余问题。

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

Conclusion: CoLA-World为领域建立了一个稳健高效的新范式，实现了潜在动作模型与世界模型的成功联合训练。

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的流形约束鲁棒图压缩框架MRGC，通过三个图数据流形学习模块，使压缩图位于平滑低维流形上，减少类别模糊性，从而在对抗攻击下保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

TL;DR: ReSpec系统通过动态调整推测解码配置、通过知识蒸馏演进草稿模型、以及基于奖励加权更新，解决了推测解码在强化学习训练中的三个关键问题，实现了最高4.5倍的加速，同时保持奖励收敛和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过强化学习进行适配时，生成阶段消耗超过75%的训练时间，而推测解码在强化学习训练中的行为尚未充分探索，存在速度提升受限、草稿模型陈旧和策略退化等问题。

Method: 提出ReSpec系统，包含三个机制：动态调整推测解码配置以适应不同批量大小，通过知识蒸馏持续更新草稿模型以保持同步，以及基于回合奖励加权更新来缓解策略退化。

Result: 在Qwen模型（3B-14B）上，ReSpec实现了最高4.5倍的加速，同时保持了奖励收敛和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ReSpec为基于强化学习的大型语言模型适配提供了一个实用的高效解决方案，成功解决了推测解码在强化学习训练中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于量子门控循环单元(QGRU)的生成对抗网络，采用连续数据注入和多度量门控策略，用于网络异常检测，在基准数据集上取得了89.43%的高时间序列感知F1分数。


<details>

Motivation: 时间序列数据中的异常检测对网络安全至关重要。现有的量子机器学习方法虽然显示出潜力，但受到量子比特数量的限制。

Method: 使用量子增强的生成器通过重参数化输出高斯分布的参数(均值和log方差)，结合Wasserstein批评器稳定对抗训练。采用新颖的门控机制，先基于高斯不确定性估计标记潜在异常，再用批评器分数和重构误差验证。

Conclusion: 该方法在NISQ设备上具有鲁棒性和实际可行性，能够准确及时地检测异常。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

Motivation: 当前RLVR中的数据选择方法主要是启发式的，缺乏理论保证和泛化性，需要理论支撑的高效数据选择方法。

Conclusion: 基于影响的数据选择对高效RLVR具有巨大潜力，CROPI框架能显著加速训练过程。

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在资源受限的可穿戴设备上使用无监督异常检测作为上游过滤机制，以提高心电图分析的鲁棒性，防止OOD数据导致的错误预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴设备的连续心电图监测对早期心血管疾病检测很重要，但标准分类器对OOD数据会产生高置信度的错误预测，威胁患者安全。现有方法要么忽略计算约束，要么分别处理噪声和未见类别。

Method: 在严格资源约束下（最多512k参数），通过神经架构搜索优化了六种UAD方法，包括Deep SVDD、重建模型、掩码异常检测、归一化流和扩散模型。在PTB-XL和BUT QDB数据集上评估对OOD CVD类别和噪声信号的检测能力。

Result: Deep SVDD在检测性能和效率之间取得了最佳平衡。在实际部署模拟中，将优化的Deep SVDD过滤器与诊断分类器集成，相比仅使用分类器的基线，准确率提高了高达21个百分点。

Conclusion: 优化的UAD过滤器可以保护自动心电图分析，使可穿戴设备上的连续心血管监测更安全可靠。

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ICPO持续提升强化学习性能和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ICPO为LRMs提供了一个可扩展且有效的RLVR范式，无需依赖高级LRM轨迹即可增强探索能力。

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

Conclusion: 多基础推测解码框架在理论和实践上都优于现有方法，为LLM推理加速提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

Motivation: 扩展HOHL的理论基础，从渐近一致性分析转向更实用的截断版本和收敛速率分析，验证其在多样化学习场景中的适用性。

Method: 使用截断版本的HOHL作为正则化器，在完全监督学习框架下分析其理论性质，并在主动学习和非几何结构数据集上进行实证验证。

Conclusion: HOHL具有强大的理论保证和实际性能，在多样化学习场景中表现出良好的通用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

Conclusion: staged B-DANN方法能够改善预测精度和泛化性能，有望在核工程等其他领域得到应用。

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited

Conclusion: 局部校准方法能够有效解决多分类校准中的邻近偏差问题，为高风险应用提供了更可靠的校准解决方案。

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

Motivation: 现有分布回归方法要么忽略概率空间的几何结构，要么计算成本高昂，需要一种能兼顾几何精度和计算效率的新方法。

Result: 在包含复杂轨迹的合成数据集上，该方法在Wasserstein距离、能量距离和RMSE指标上表现出有竞争力的近似质量，特别是在显著非线性情况下，轨迹平滑度优于或与替代方法相当，对数据结构变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法代表了几何精度、计算实用性和可解释性的平衡解决方案，未来研究方向包括扩展到非高斯分布、应用熵正则化加速计算，以及适应高维数据近似曲面和更复杂结构。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了时间序列分类方法作为异常检测模型选择的性能，证明模型选择方法在保持相似执行时间的同时，优于任何单一异常检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于在异构时间序列数据集上不存在通用的最佳异常检测方法，需要基于时间序列特征选择最合适的异常检测方法。现有的AutoML解决方案不适用于时间序列异常检测，且缺乏对基于时间序列的模型选择方法的评估。

Method: 评估了来自16个基础分类器的234种模型配置，在1980多个时间序列上进行实验，首次对时间序列分类作为异常检测模型选择进行了广泛评估。

Result: 模型选择方法在保持与单一异常检测方法相同数量级的执行时间的同时，表现优于所有单一异常检测方法。

Conclusion: 这是证明时间序列分类算法在异常检测中准确性和效率的第一步，为通用AutoML流水线中的模型选择步骤提供了强基线。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

TL;DR: 提出Curly-FM方法，通过设计具有非零漂移参考过程的Schrödinger桥问题，能够学习非梯度场动力学，解决了现有方法无法捕捉周期性行为的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多真实世界系统（如单细胞RNA中的细胞周期）表现出非梯度、周期性行为，而现有基于最小作用原理的方法只能学习梯度场动力学，无法捕捉这类行为。

Method: 设计并求解具有非零漂移参考过程的Schrödinger桥问题，使用推断的速度和种群快照数据构建参考过程，从而学习非梯度场动力学。

Result: 在单细胞、计算流体动力学和洋流轨迹推断问题上，Curly-FM能够学习更匹配参考过程和种群边际的轨迹，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Curly-FM扩展了流匹配模型的能力，使其能够建模物理系统中已知的周期性行为，超越了仅建模种群动态的限制。

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于奇异值分解和标准扰动机制的简单高效算法，用于在差分隐私下计算矩阵前r个奇异向量的跨度，其误差仅取决于秩r相干性和谱间隙，解决了Hardt和Roth提出的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在差分隐私下计算矩阵前r个奇异向量跨度的问题，改进现有方法，使其在密集设置下达到与非私有最优算法相同的保证。

Method: 使用奇异值分解和标准扰动机制，基于秩r相干性和谱间隙来构建私有秩r近似。

Result: 新算法在密集设置下实现了与最优非私有算法相同的单峰PCA保证，而先前的私有算法未能做到。同时证明了秩r相干性在高斯扰动下不会增加。

Conclusion: 该算法在多个场景下优于现有技术，特别是在密集设置下，并展示了相干性在图问题中的应用潜力。

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAQuant是一种针对LoRA适配器的混合精度后训练量化方法，通过SVD重参数化将重要信息集中在特定行列，从而对重要组件使用高精度量化，其余部分使用超低位宽量化，显著降低存储成本同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多适配器场景下，虽然单个LoRA适配器轻量，但大规模部署时总体成本显著。需要一种有效的量化方法来减少存储需求而不影响性能。

Method: 使用奇异值分解(SVD)对每个适配器进行重参数化，将重要信息集中在特定行列，然后对重要组件使用高精度量化，其余部分使用超低位宽量化。

Result: 在LLaMA 2-7B、LLaMA 2-13B和Mistral 7B模型上的数学推理、编程和摘要任务实验表明，LoRAQuant使用显著更低的比特数，但达到可比甚至更高的性能。

Conclusion: LoRAQuant是一种有效的LoRA适配器量化方法，能够显著降低存储成本，同时在大规模多适配器部署中保持模型性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Conclusion: 通过特定的正则化项设计，可逆神经网络能够恢复经典贝叶斯点估计器的特性，为逆问题提供稳定且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ARC-Top-K压缩器，通过轻量级梯度草图对齐节点间的稀疏模式，实现免索引的All-Reduce操作，在保持全局重要信息的同时显著减少通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有梯度压缩方法存在局限性：Rand-K丢弃结构信息且实际表现差，Top-K保留信息但失去收缩性且需要昂贵的All-Gather操作。需要一种结合两者优点的解决方案。

Method: ARC-Top-K压缩器使用轻量级梯度草图对齐节点间的稀疏模式，实现免索引的All-Reduce操作，保持收缩性，并与动量误差反馈(EF21M)结合。

Result: ARC-Top-K在精度上与Top-K相当，同时将训练时间减少高达60.7%，实现了线性加速和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K提供了高效可扩展的解决方案，结合了Rand-K的鲁棒性和Top-K的强性能，显著缓解了大规模分布式机器学习中的通信瓶颈。

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

TL;DR: 本文指出当前机器学习遗忘(MU)算法评估中的问题：由于对模型训练随机种子的高度敏感性，仅从同一训练模型出发进行多次独立运行会得出非代表性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习遗忘算法旨在无需昂贵重新训练的情况下从训练模型中移除特定数据点的影响。大多数实用MU算法都是近似方法，其性能只能通过实证评估。为确保评估的代表性，需要解决当前评估方法中的潜在问题。

Method: 通过分析发现，即使使用相同架构和数据集，某些MU方法对模型训练随机种子的选择高度敏感。因此提出新的评估建议。

Result: 研究表明，从同一训练模型出发进行多次独立运行的常见评估实践可能产生高度非代表性的结果，因为MU方法的性能会因训练种子的不同而有显著变化。

Conclusion: 建议在MU算法的实证比较中，应考虑不同模型训练种子带来的变异性，以获得更全面和代表性的评估结果。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

Furthermore, LSM-MS2 produces rich spectral embeddings that enable direct
biological interpretation from minimal downstream data, successfully
differentiating disease states and predicting clinical outcomes across diverse

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私协方差估计方法在不同范数下的误差保证不够理想，特别是在谱范数上尚未达到信息论最优。需要开发一种机制能同时在不同范数下获得最优或接近最优的误差保证。

Method: 使用简单的扰动机制，对于大数据集直接应用，对于小数据集将输出投影到适当半径的核范数球上。

Result: 在大数据集(n≥d²/ε)上，恢复Frobenius范数的最优误差保证，同时在所有p-Schatten范数上达到已知最佳误差，在p≥2时信息论最优。在小数据集上，Frobenius范数误差改进为O(√(dTr(Σ)/n))。

Conclusion: 该机制是第一个在纯差分隐私下达到谱范数最优误差的协方差估计器，在不同数据集规模下均能提供改进的误差保证。

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of

Motivation: 当前量化方法在激活量化到8比特以下时准确率急剧下降，需要新的策略来维持模型精度。

Result: 在最近的LVM和LLM架构上评估，显著改善低比特激活量化，并与现有量化方法互补。

Conclusion: STaMP量化是有效的低比特激活量化策略，能维持模型精度同时降低平均激活比特宽度。

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

Motivation: 传统影响函数计算需要整个数据集的Hessian矩阵，计算资源消耗大。随机采样方法虽然可行但估计结果高度不一致，需要更有效的采样策略。

Conclusion: 提出的采样方法能够有效提高影响函数估计的准确性，同时显著降低计算成本，为黑盒模型训练数据影响分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

TL;DR: AI在知识推理基准测试上进步迅速，但经济价值转化有限。研究人员提出远程劳动指数(RLI)来评估AI代理在实际经济场景中的表现，结果显示AI自动化率仅为2.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI在研究型基准测试中表现优异，但其实际经济价值和自动化能力尚不明确，需要建立更贴近现实经济活动的评估标准。

Method: 引入远程劳动指数(RLI)，这是一个多行业基准，包含真实世界中有经济价值的项目，用于评估AI代理在实践环境中的端到端表现。

Result: AI代理在RLI上的表现接近最低水平，表现最佳的代理仅实现2.5%的自动化率。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI自动化讨论提供了实证基础，建立了跟踪AI影响的共同基准，帮助利益相关者主动应对AI驱动的劳动力自动化。

Abstract: AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge and
reasoning, but it remains unclear how these gains translate into economic value
and automation. To measure this, we introduce the Remote Labor Index (RLI), a
broadly multi-sector benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable
projects designed to evaluate end-to-end agent performance in practical
settings. AI agents perform near the floor on RLI, with the highest-performing
agent achieving an automation rate of 2.5%. These results help ground
discussions of AI automation in empirical evidence, setting a common basis for
tracking AI impacts and enabling stakeholders to proactively navigate AI-driven
labor automation.

*Penghui Qi,Zichen Liu,Xiangxin Zhou,Tianyu Pang,Chao Du,Wee Sun Lee,Min Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现BF16浮点精度在RL微调中会导致训练和推理策略不一致，简单改用FP16即可解决该问题，带来更稳定的优化和更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型RL微调中因数值不匹配导致的不稳定问题，发现根本原因在于浮点精度选择不当。

Method: 将浮点精度从BF16改为FP16，无需修改模型架构或学习算法，仅需几行代码变更。

Result: 使用FP16能实现更稳定的优化、更快的收敛速度，并在多种任务、算法和框架中表现出更强的性能。

Conclusion: 建议在RL微调中重新考虑精度权衡，FP16是更优选择。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

### [112] [Learning Pseudorandom Numbers with Transformers: Permuted Congruential Generators, Curricula, and Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26792)
*Tao Tao,Maissam Barkeshli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明Transformer模型能够学习PCG伪随机数生成器生成的序列，即使输出被截断到单比特也能可靠预测，并发现了模数平方根的缩放规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer模型学习复杂伪随机数生成器（PCG）序列的能力，PCG相比LCG增加了位操作难度，测试模型在未见序列上的上下文预测能力。

Method: 使用Transformer模型在PCG变体生成的序列上进行训练和测试，模数规模达2^22，参数达5000万，数据集达50亿token，分析模型在不同模数下的学习行为。

Result: 模型能成功预测PCG序列，即使输出截断到单比特；发现预测所需序列长度与模数平方根成正比；大模数学习需要小模数数据的课程学习；嵌入层出现位旋转不变聚类现象。

Conclusion: Transformer能够学习复杂的PCG伪随机序列，揭示了模型对位操作模式的识别能力，以及课程学习在大模数学习中的必要性，为理解神经网络学习算法提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

Result: 在合成环境和基准环境（如Mountain Car）中的实验表明，该方法显著提高了覆盖率和可靠性，优于标准分布RL基线。

Conclusion: 该框架能够处理未观测回报、时间依赖性和分布偏移等挑战，即使在策略偏移下也能实现不确定性量化。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for reinforcement learning
(RL) in high-stakes settings. We propose a unified conformal prediction
framework for infinite-horizon policy evaluation that constructs
distribution-free prediction intervals {for returns} in both on-policy and
off-policy settings. Our method integrates distributional RL with conformal
calibration, addressing challenges such as unobserved returns, temporal
dependencies, and distributional shifts. We propose a modular pseudo-return
construction based on truncated rollouts and a time-aware calibration strategy
using experience replay and weighted subsampling. These innovations mitigate
model bias and restore approximate exchangeability, enabling uncertainty
quantification even under policy shifts. Our theoretical analysis provides
coverage guarantees that account for model misspecification and importance
weight estimation. Empirical results, including experiments in synthetic and
benchmark environments like Mountain Car, show that our method significantly
improves coverage and reliability over standard distributional RL baselines.

Motivation: 在许多现实场景中，不定核比正定核能捕捉更多领域特定的结构信息，但现有IKLR框架缺乏稀疏性，限制了模型的解释性和泛化能力。

Method: 在现有IKLR框架基础上引入L1范数惩罚项，开发了理论上有基础且计算效率高的近端线性化算法来处理非光滑和非凸优化问题。

Conclusion: RIKLR模型通过L1正则化成功增强了不定核逻辑回归的稀疏性和解释性，同时保持了良好的分类性能。

Abstract: Kernel logistic regression (KLR) is a powerful classification method widely
applied across diverse domains. In many real-world scenarios, indefinite
kernels capture more domain-specific structural information than positive
definite kernels. This paper proposes a novel $L_1$-norm regularized indefinite
kernel logistic regression (RIKLR) model, which extends the existing IKLR
framework by introducing sparsity via an $L_1$-norm penalty. The introduction
of this regularization enhances interpretability and generalization while
introducing nonsmoothness and nonconvexity into the optimization landscape. To
address these challenges, a theoretically grounded and computationally
efficient proximal linearized algorithm is developed. Experimental results on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed method in terms of both accuracy and sparsity.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减轻合成数据的不利影响，可扩展到不平衡多任务学习和因果推断等更广泛场景

Abstract: Imbalanced data, where the positive samples represent only a small proportion
compared to the negative samples, makes it challenging for classification
problems to balance the false positive and false negative rates. A common
approach to addressing the challenge involves generating synthetic data for the
minority group and then training classification models with both observed and
synthetic data. However, since the synthetic data depends on the observed data
and fails to replicate the original data distribution accurately, prediction
accuracy is reduced when the synthetic data is naively treated as the true
data. In this paper, we address the bias introduced by synthetic data and
provide consistent estimators for this bias by borrowing information from the
majority group. We propose a bias correction procedure to mitigate the adverse
effects of synthetic data, enhancing prediction accuracy while avoiding
overfitting. This procedure is extended to broader scenarios with imbalanced
data, such as imbalanced multi-task learning and causal inference. Theoretical
properties, including bounds on bias estimation errors and improvements in
prediction accuracy, are provided. Simulation results and data analysis on
handwritten digit datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统二次规划求解器在高维问题中计算成本高昂，需要开发能够针对每个问题实例进行高效变量降维的方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能为未见过的QP问题生成高质量可行解，计算时间显著减少，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的投影方法为高效求解二次规划问题提供了新思路，神经网络生成的投影矩阵具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for efficiently solving quadratic
programming (QP) problems by reducing the number of variables in
high-dimensional QPs using instance-specific projection. A graph neural
network-based model is designed to generate projections tailored to each QP
instance, enabling us to produce high-quality solutions even for previously
unseen problems. The model is trained on heterogeneous QPs to minimize the
expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions. This is
formulated as a bilevel optimization problem; the inner optimization solves the
QP under a given projection using a QP solver, while the outer optimization
updates the model parameters. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this
bilevel optimization problem, which computes parameter gradients without
backpropagating through the solver. We provide a theoretical analysis of the
generalization ability of solving QPs with projection matrices generated by
neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces
high-quality feasible solutions with reduced computation time, outperforming
existing methods.

### [118] [Uncertainty-Aware Diagnostics for Physics-Informed Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26121)
*Mara Daniels,Liam Hodgkinson,Michael Mahoney*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了物理信息对数证据（PILE）评分，这是一个单一、考虑不确定性的指标，用于解决物理信息机器学习中多目标优化带来的模型质量评估模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的物理信息机器学习方法通常同时包含数据和物理约束的多目标优化，这导致模型质量评估存在模糊性，与认知不确定性理解不足相关，即使统计指标显示良好拟合也可能出现意外失败模式。

Method: 在高斯过程回归框架内引入物理信息对数证据（PILE）评分，绕过测试损失的模糊性，为PIML模型的超参数提供选择原则。

Result: PILE最小化能为各种模型参数（包括核带宽、最小二乘正则化权重甚至核函数选择）提供优秀选择。在数据获取前，PILE的特殊'无数据'情况也能识别先验核选择。

Conclusion: PILE评分可以扩展到更广泛的PIML领域，为物理信息机器学习提供更好的模型选择和超参数优化方法。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) integrates prior physical
information, often in the form of differential equation constraints, into the
process of fitting machine learning models to physical data. Popular PIML
approaches, including neural operators, physics-informed neural networks,
neural ordinary differential equations, and neural discrete equilibria, are
typically fit to objectives that simultaneously include both data and physical
constraints. However, the multi-objective nature of this approach creates
ambiguity in the measurement of model quality. This is related to a poor
understanding of epistemic uncertainty, and it can lead to surprising failure
modes, even when existing statistical metrics suggest strong fits. Working
within a Gaussian process regression framework, we introduce the
Physics-Informed Log Evidence (PILE) score. Bypassing the ambiguities of test
losses, the PILE score is a single, uncertainty-aware metric that provides a
selection principle for hyperparameters of a PIML model. We show that PILE
minimization yields excellent choices for a wide variety of model parameters,
including kernel bandwidth, least squares regularization weights, and even
kernel function selection. We also show that, even prior to data acquisition, a
special 'data-free' case of the PILE score identifies a priori kernel choices
that are 'well-adapted' to a given PDE. Beyond the kernel setting, we
anticipate that the PILE score can be extended to PIML at large, and we outline
approaches to do so.

TL;DR: 提出了多输出鲁棒共轭高斯过程（MO-RCGP），这是一种能够处理多输出相关数据中异常值的鲁棒高斯过程模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多输出高斯过程对模型误设和异常值敏感，特别是当多个相关输出变量同时出现异常时，误差会通过输出间的相关性传播，影响预测精度。

Method: 扩展和推广了Altamirano等人（2024）提出的鲁棒共轭高斯过程（RCGP）框架，构建了多输出RCGP（MO-RCGP），该模型具有共轭性，能够联合捕获输出间的相关性。

Result: 在金融和癌症研究应用中进行了全面评估，验证了MO-RCGP的有效性。

Conclusion: MO-RCGP是一种可证明鲁棒的多输出高斯过程，能够有效处理多输出相关数据中的异常值问题。

Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) regression allows modelling dependencies
among multiple correlated response variables. Similarly to standard Gaussian
processes, MOGPs are sensitive to model misspecification and outliers, which
can distort predictions within individual outputs. This situation can be
further exacerbated by multiple anomalous response variables whose errors
propagate due to correlations between outputs. To handle this situation, we
extend and generalise the robust and conjugate Gaussian process (RCGP)
framework introduced by Altamirano et al. (2024). This results in the
multi-output RCGP (MO-RCGP): a provably robust MOGP that is conjugate, and
jointly captures correlations across outputs. We thoroughly evaluate our
approach through applications in finance and cancer research.

Result: 证明了最小化KL散度等价于最大熵强化学习，为随机过程和强化学习的统一提供了理论框架。

Conclusion: 动作驱动过程成功地将随机过程与强化学习统一起来，为脉冲神经网络等复杂系统的建模和控制提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: At the heart of reinforcement learning are actions -- decisions made in
response to observations of the environment. Actions are equally fundamental in
the modeling of stochastic processes, as they trigger discontinuous state
transitions and enable the flow of information through large, complex systems.
In this paper, we unify the perspectives of stochastic processes and
reinforcement learning through action-driven processes, and illustrate their
application to spiking neural networks. Leveraging ideas from
control-as-inference, we show that minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between a policy-driven true distribution and a reward-driven model
distribution for a suitably defined action-driven process is equivalent to
maximum entropy reinforcement learning.

*Gerard T. Portela,Jason B. Gibbons,Sebastian Schneeweiss,Rishi J. Desai*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 评估因果机器学习模型在条件可交换性假设违反时的表现，以及负控制结果作为诊断工具的有效性。研究发现条件可交换性违反会严重影响个体化治疗效应估计的效度，而负控制结果能有效检测未测量混杂。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前观测性研究开发预测个体化治疗效应的因果机器学习模型时，很少实证评估条件可交换性假设。本研究旨在评估这些模型在条件可交换性违反时的表现，以及负控制结果作为诊断工具的有效性。

Method: 通过模拟研究，在不同条件下（包括是否存在真实异质性）检验因果森林和X-learner模型生成的个体化治疗效应估计中的混杂偏倚。模拟数据反映真实世界场景，包括不同水平的混杂、样本量和负控制结果混杂结构。

Result: 当条件可交换性违反时，因果森林和X-learner模型无法恢复真实的治疗效应异质性，有时甚至在没有异质性的情况下错误地指示异质性。负控制结果成功识别了受未测量混杂影响的亚组。即使负控制结果不完全满足理想假设，它仍然具有信息价值，能标记亚组水平估计中的潜在偏倚。

Conclusion: 条件可交换性的违反严重限制了常规收集的观测数据中因果机器学习模型个体化治疗效应估计的效度。负控制结果作为检测亚组特异性未测量混杂的实证诊断工具很有用，应纳入因果机器学习工作流程以支持个体化推断的可信度。

Abstract: Observational studies developing causal machine learning (ML) models for the
prediction of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) seldom conduct empirical
evaluations to assess the conditional exchangeability assumption. We aimed to
evaluate the performance of these models under conditional exchangeability
violations and the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic.
We conducted a simulation study to examine confounding bias in ITE estimates
generated by causal forest and X-learner models under varying conditions,
including the presence or absence of true heterogeneity. We simulated data to
reflect real-world scenarios with differing levels of confounding, sample size,
and NCO confounding structures. We then estimated and compared subgroup-level
treatment effects on the primary outcome and NCOs across settings with and
without unmeasured confounding. When conditional exchangeability was violated,
causal forest and X-learner models failed to recover true treatment effect
heterogeneity and, in some cases, falsely indicated heterogeneity when there
was none. NCOs successfully identified subgroups affected by unmeasured
confounding. Even when NCOs did not perfectly satisfy its ideal assumptions, it
remained informative, flagging potential bias in subgroup level estimates,
though not always pinpointing the subgroup with the largest confounding.
Violations of conditional exchangeability substantially limit the validity of
ITE estimates from causal ML models in routinely collected observational data.
NCOs serve a useful empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific
unmeasured confounding and should be incorporated into causal ML workflows to
support the credibility of individualized inference.

Motivation: 政策学习中的EWM方法和插件方法虽然形式不同，但本质上可能解决相同的优化问题，理解这种等价关系有助于开发更高效的计算方法。

Method: 证明了EWM与政策类重新参数化后的最小二乘法之间的精确等价性，并基于此提出了一种避免NP-hard组合步骤的正则化训练方法。

Result: 发现两种方法在共同条件下具有相同的理论保证，提出的新方法实现了凸优化和计算效率的提升。

Conclusion: EWM和插件方法本质上是等价的，这种等价性为政策学习提供了更高效的计算框架，避免了传统EWM中的组合复杂性。

Abstract: The goal of policy learning is to train a policy function that recommends a
treatment given covariates to maximize population welfare. There are two major
approaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)
approach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a
classification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population
welfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by
maximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on
regression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect
(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.
This study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are
based on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an
exact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of
the policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in
several respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common
conditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization
method for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationally
efficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial step
typically required in EWM.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的因果推断理论框架，整合了Riesz回归、协变量平衡、密度比估计、目标最大似然估计和匹配估计器在平均处理效应估计中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的因果推断方法如Riesz回归、协变量平衡、密度比估计、目标最大似然估计和匹配估计器在平均处理效应估计中各有侧重，但缺乏统一的理论框架来理解它们之间的内在联系。

Method: 通过建立统一的理论框架，揭示这些方法在平衡权重和结果回归函数估计中的本质联系，证明Riesz回归与密度比估计在ATE背景下等价，匹配估计器是密度比估计的特例，密度比估计与协变量平衡存在对偶关系。

Result: 证明了不同方法之间的等价性和对偶关系：Riesz回归与密度比估计等价，匹配估计器是密度比估计的特例，密度比估计与协变量平衡存在对偶关系，最近邻匹配等价于最小二乘密度比估计和Riesz回归。

Conclusion: 这些因果推断方法在理论上是统一的，平衡权重（Riesz表示器、偏置校正项、聪明协变量）和回归函数估计在不同方法中扮演着相似的角色，TMLE通过构造回归函数估计器使主导偏置项为零。

Abstract: This note introduces a unified theory for causal inference that integrates
Riesz regression, covariate balancing, density-ratio estimation (DRE), targeted
maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and the matching estimator in average
treatment effect (ATE) estimation. In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and
the regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the
balancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction
term, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression,
covariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating
the balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE
in the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is
in a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for
constructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term
becomes zero. Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density
Ratio Estimation and Riesz Regression.
