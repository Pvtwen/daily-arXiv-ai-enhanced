Copyright maybe transferred without notice", "summary": "Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) is a\ndelay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme in which the signal processing is\ncarried out in the DD domain. The channel when viewed in the DD domain is\npredictable. However, even with Zak-OTFS, pilots need to be sent periodically,\nalbeit at a lower rate. In this paper, we propose a differential communication\nscheme for Zak-OTFS systems that alleviates the need for periodic pilot\ntransmission. Towards this, we analytically show that the detected data can be\nused as a pilot and that the channel estimate obtained from the detected data\ncan enable further detection enabling the \"differential\" aspect of the\ncommunication. Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD\nchannel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data\nsymbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next\ninstant and propagate this forward.

Despite advances in\nmulti-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures\nthat effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different\nphysiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in\nmany biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional\nmethods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified\ndeep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across\ndifferent signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an\nattention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:\ntime-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to\ngenerate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase\nsignal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in\nthe best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps\nincluded wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class\nimbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced\ndata augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were\napplied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the\nproposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH\nArrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,\nand 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types\nand clinical contexts.

One\nof them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data\ndistribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the\nfusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing\nattention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order\nto create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may\nbecome prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data.

An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to\navoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a\nstrategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make\nthem more applicable and quicker.

Existing DCT methods\nmainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete\none-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their\napplications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of\ndata, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful\nmeasurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex\ndistributions, into DCT scenarios.

While this\npretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as\nVision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents\nnumerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score\nmillions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints\nimposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions\nbetween user activities and other features and handle new items that were not\npresent during the pretraining stage.\n  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our\ninfrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated\nCross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on\nPinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions\nbetween user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading\nto a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help\nimprove the experience of more than a half billion users across various\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "PinFM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u6d3b\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u7528\u6237\u6d3b\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u662f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a20B+\u53c2\u6570\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u521b\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982DCAT\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "PinFM\u63d0\u5347\u4e86600%\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u4f7f\u65b0\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8620%\u3002", "conclusion": "PinFM\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc75\u4ebf\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

NTKs typically actively change during\ntraining and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on\nGradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in\nwhich the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely\nproportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored\nthe underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the\nunderstanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still\nmissing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in\ndetail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates\ncause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK\nmatrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the\nunderlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for\na two-layer linear network.

This approach improves training\nstability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size.\nSecondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are\noften discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these\nsamples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance\nsample efficiency.

However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying\nlayer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence\nof graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This\nwork revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir\nGraph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a\nvariant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of\nsurface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band\nspectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted\nto the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral\nformulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks\nwhere smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph\nclassification.

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent\nrelations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nKGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such\nas translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These\ngeometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific\nstructural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs\nby KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific\ntransformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by\nensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite\nversion of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent\nall the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how\nwell each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this\nranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each\nrelation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply\nacross all relations.

Finally, we show that, for all G and k>2, learnability for k-vertex\npermutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, yielding a\nfour-class partition of infinite graphs, whose complexity we also determine\nusing tools coming from both descriptive set theory and computability theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7531\u65e0\u9650\u53ef\u6570\u56feG\u7684\u526f\u672c\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u7c7b\u7684PAC\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u526f\u672c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u6362G\u7684\u9876\u70b9\u751f\u6210\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u652f\u6301\u526f\u672c\u7684PAC\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u6697\u793a\u4e86G\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u540c\u6784\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u81ea\u540c\u6784\u5e73\u51e1\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u56fe\u6807\u8bb0\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5df2\u77e5\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u96c6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f6e\u6362\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u7531\u6709\u9650\u652f\u6301\u7f6e\u6362\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u526f\u672c\u7684PAC\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u652f\u6301\u526f\u672c\u7684PAC\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8eG\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u540c\u6784\u5e73\u51e1\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e24\u9876\u70b9\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u523b\u753b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u9650\u56fe\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u63cf\u8ff0\u96c6\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing\ncompactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic\ndescriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element\ndisplacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,\nwhich encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the\ntwo halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which\nsummarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our\nempirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently\noutperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation\noptimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more\ncompact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation\nspace.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6392\u5217\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u6838\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dMallows\u6838\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u7531\u5192\u6ce1\u6392\u5e8f\u884d\u751f\u7684\u7279\u4f8b\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684Merge Kernel\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Mallows\u6838\u5728\u6392\u5217\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\uff08\u03a9(n\u00b2)\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u6838\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMerge Kernel\uff08\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u0398(n log n)\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMerge Kernel\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6392\u5217\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eMallows\u6838\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "Merge Kernel\u4e3a\u6392\u5217\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}
