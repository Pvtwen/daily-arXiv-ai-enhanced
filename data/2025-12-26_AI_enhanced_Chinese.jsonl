Although the literature includes linear and near-linear time algorithms for the LAD line fitting problem, these methods are difficult to implement and, to our knowledge, lack maintained public implementations. As a result, practitioners often resort to linear programming (LP) based methods such as the simplex-based Barrodale-Roberts method and interior-point methods, or on iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approximation which does not guarantee exact solutions. To close this gap, we propose the Piecewise Affine Lower-Bounding (PALB) method, an exact algorithm for LAD line fitting. PALB uses supporting lines derived from subgradients to build piecewise-affine lower bounds, and employs a subdivision scheme involving minima of these lower bounds. We prove correctness and provide bounds on the number of iterations. On synthetic datasets with varied signal types and noise including heavy-tailed outliers as well as a real dataset from the NOAA's Integrated Surface Database, PALB exhibits empirical log-linear scaling. It is consistently faster than publicly available implementations of LP based and IRLS based solvers.

The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity.

Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings.

However, neither architecture is adequate to flexibly support distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) services, due to the increasing difficulty of aligning spatiotemporally distributed heterogeneous service demands with available radio resources. In this paper, we propose an elastic network topology (ENT) for distributed ISAC service provisioning, where multiple co-existing localized CCNs can be dynamically aggregated into CFNs with expanded boundaries for federated network operation. This topology elastically orchestrates localized CCN and federated CFN boundaries to balance signaling overhead and distributed resource utilization, thereby enabling efficient ISAC service provisioning. A two-phase operation protocol is then developed. In Phase I, each CCN autonomously classifies ISAC services as either local or federated and partitions its resources into dedicated and shared segments. In Phase II, each CCN employs its dedicated resources for local ISAC services, while the aggregated CFN consolidates shared resources from its constituent CCNs to cooperatively deliver federated services. Furthermore, we design a utility-to-signaling ratio (USR) to quantify the tradeoff between sensing/communication utility and signaling overhead. Consequently, a USR maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the network topology (i.e., service classification and CCN aggregation) and the allocation of dedicated and shared resources. However, this problem is challenging due to its distributed optimization nature and the absence of complete channel state information. To address this problem efficiently, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework with centralized training and decentralized execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\uff08ENT\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fISAC\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u5408CCN\u4e3aCFN\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u4fe1\u4ee4\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528MADRL\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CCN/CFN\uff09\u7684\u521a\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u96be\u4ee5\u7075\u6d3b\u652f\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fISAC\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u670d\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u53ef\u7528\u65e0\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u5bf9\u9f50\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\uff08ENT\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u64cd\u4f5c\u534f\u8bae\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5404CCN\u81ea\u4e3b\u5206\u7c7bISAC\u670d\u52a1\u5e76\u5212\u5206\u8d44\u6e90\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5CCN\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u7528\u8d44\u6e90\u5904\u7406\u672c\u5730\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u7684CFN\u6574\u5408\u5171\u4eab\u8d44\u6e90\u5904\u7406\u8054\u90a6\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1USR\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u4fe1\u4ee4\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528MADRL\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fISAC\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u4f9b\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u4fe1\u4ee4\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7MADRL\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u80fd\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u652f\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fISAC\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\u548cMADRL\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u5728ISAC\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Our primary objective is to mitigate bifurcation-related issues by preprocessing the training data to enhance reconstruction quality, particularly for small-scale network architectures. Specifically, we propose applying Gaussianization preprocessing to the training data to make the target distribution more closely resemble an independent Gaussian distribution, which serves as the initial density of the reconstruction process.

Code available at https://github.com/wltang-dev/Latent-Strategy-RL-Agent", "summary": "This study proposes a multi-agent language framework that enables continual strategy evolution without fine-tuning the language model's parameters. The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text.\n  Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards.

However, current coordination models often struggle with unreliable data, intentional misinformation, and the breakdown of critical communication infrastructure. A decentralized, vote-based blockchain model offers a compelling substrate for achieving this real-time, trusted coordination. This article explores a blockchain-driven approach to rapidly update a dynamic 3D crisis map based on inputs from users and local sensors. Each node submits a timestamped and geotagged vote to a public ledger, enabling agencies to visualize needs as they emerge. However, ensuring the physical authenticity of these claims demands more than cryptography alone. We propose a dual-layer architecture where mobile UAV verifiers perform physical-layer attestation and issue independent location flags to the blockchain. This dual-signature mechanism fuses immutable digital records with sensory-grounded trust. We analyze core technical and human centric challenges, ranging from spoofing and vote ambiguity to verifier compromise and connectivity loss, and outline layered mitigation strategies and future research directions. As a concrete instantiation, we present a UAV mapping scheme leveraging modulated retro-reflector (MRR) sensors and 3D-aware LoS placement to maximize verifiability under urban occlusion, offering a path toward resilient, trust-anchored crisis coordination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u707e\u96be\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u4fe1\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u6295\u7968\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u5408\u786e\u4fdd\u5371\u673a\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u707e\u96be\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u6545\u610f\u8bef\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5d29\u6e83\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1) \u6570\u5b57\u6295\u7968\u5c42\uff1a\u7528\u6237\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u63d0\u4ea4\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u548c\u5730\u7406\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6295\u7968\u5230\u516c\u5171\u8d26\u672c\uff1b2) \u7269\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5c42\uff1a\u79fb\u52a8\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u5236\u540e\u5411\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c3D\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u8ddd\u90e8\u7f72\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\u6570\u5b57\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0e\u611f\u5b98\u57fa\u7840\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u53cc\u7b7e\u540d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5206\u6790\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4eba\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5982\u6b3a\u9a97\u3001\u6295\u7968\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u59a5\u534f\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u5f39\u6027\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u5371\u673a\u534f\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u906e\u6321\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u672a\u6765\u707e\u96be\u54cd\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a Causal-Driven Attribution (CDA) framework that infers channel influence using only aggregated impression-level data, avoiding any reliance on user identifiers or click-path tracking. CDA integrates temporal causal discovery (using PCMCI) with causal effect estimation via a Structural Causal Model to recover directional channel relationships and quantify their contributions to conversions. Using large-scale synthetic data designed to replicate real marketing dynamics, we show that CDA achieves an average relative RMSE of 9.50% when given the true causal graph, and 24.23% when using the predicted graph, demonstrating strong accuracy under correct structure and meaningful signal recovery even under structural uncertainty.

A centralized quantum hub emits entangled photons, directing one toward a target device and the other toward a local reference unit. The target, equipped with a planar CCR array, reflects the incoming photon without active circuitry, enabling secure round-trip quantum measurements for sub-nanosecond synchronization and localization. We develop a comprehensive analytical model that captures key physical-layer phenomena, including Gaussian beam spread, spatial misalignment, atmospheric turbulence, and probabilistic photon generation. A closed-form expression is derived for the single-photon detection probability under Gamma-Gamma fading, and its distribution is used to model photon arrival events and synchronization error.

Our work is the first to study this particular subgroup problem, for which we make several contributions.\n  Subgroup discovery methods generally require a \"quality function\" in order to sift through and select the most advantageous subgroups. We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.\n  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings. Lastly, we conduct a case study on jet engine simulation data from NASA.

Traditional models often fail to capture semantic information across multimodal streams, while large-scale fine-tuning approaches are impractical in clinical workflows. We introduce a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to convert laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-aligned features. Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines. Using a lung cancer cohort (N=184), we benchmarked GKC against expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer. Our approach achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed all baselines. An ablation study further confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities. These results show that the quality of semantic representation is a key determinant of predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data settings.

We introduce the area-based signal-to-noise ratio (aSNR) as a robust alternative that integrates the signal over a defined region of interest, reducing noise variance and improving detection for various lineshapes. We used Monte Carlo simulations (n=2,000 trials per condition) to test aSNR on Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt lineshapes. We found that aSNR requires significantly lower amplitudes than pSNR to achieve a 50% detection probability. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves show that aSNR performs better than pSNR at low amplitudes.

A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u529b\u5b66(NFD)\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0a\u9075\u5faa\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u5982muP\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55(depth-muP)\u5728\u591a\u5c42\u6b8b\u5dee\u5757\u4e2d\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5355\u5c42\u6b8b\u5dee\u5757ResNets\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u529b\u5b66(NFD)\uff0c\u5728\u8054\u5408\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u65e0\u9650\u6df1\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u7684\u524d\u5411-\u540e\u5411\u968f\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u5c42\u6b8b\u5dee\u5757\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u5d29\u6e83\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "NFD\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4f55\u65f6\u6301\u7eed\u6709\u6548\u4ee5\u53ca\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57281/\u221a\u6df1\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f29\u653e\u4e0b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u68af\u5ea6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u91cd\u65b0\u6709\u6548\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5c42ResNets\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms.\n  We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.\n  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment.

However, the extreme sensitivity of optical beams to relative satellite motion, pointing jitter, and rapidly evolving geometry makes routing fundamentally more challenging than in RF-based systems. In particular, intra-plane and inter-plane ISLs exhibit markedly different stability and feasible range profiles, producing a dynamic, partially constrained connectivity structure that must be respected by any physically consistent routing strategy. This paper presents a lightweight geometry- and QoS-aware routing framework for optical LEO networks that incorporates class-dependent feasibility constraints derived from a jitter-aware Gaussian-beam model. These analytically computed thresholds are embedded directly into the time-varying ISL graph and enforced via feasible-action masking in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent. The proposed method leverages local geometric progress, feasible-neighbor structure, and congestion indicators to select next-hop relays without requiring global recomputation. Simulation results on a Starlink-like constellation show that the learned paths are physically consistent, exploit intra-plane stability, adapt to jitter-limited inter-plane connectivity, and maintain robust end-to-end latency under dynamic topology evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u5b66LEO\u536b\u661f\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DRL\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8def\u7531\u9009\u62e9", "motivation": "\u5149\u5b66\u661f\u95f4\u94fe\u8def\uff08ISLs\uff09\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LEO\u661f\u5ea7\u4e2d\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u4fe1\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u4f46\u5149\u5b66\u6ce2\u675f\u5bf9\u536b\u661f\u76f8\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u6307\u5411\u6296\u52a8\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u6781\u5176\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u8def\u7531\u6bd4RF\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u5e73\u9762\u5185\u7684ISLs\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u51e0\u4f55\u548cQoS\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6296\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u9ad8\u65af\u5149\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u5bfc\u7c7b\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9608\u503c\u5d4c\u5165\u65f6\u53d8ISL\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a9\u7801\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u8fdb\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u884c\u90bb\u5c45\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u62e5\u585e\u6307\u6807\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u4e0b\u4e00\u8df3\u4e2d\u7ee7\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3cStarlink\u7684\u661f\u5ea7\u4e0a\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u9762\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u6296\u52a8\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u95f4\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u62d3\u6251\u6f14\u5316\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8def\u7531\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DRL\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u5b66LEO\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks", "comment": null, "summary": "The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform \"low-level\" tasks before \"high-level\" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8868\u660e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5982\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8868\u660e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6700\u4f18\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4eba\u4eec\u4ecd\u5e38\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u5c42\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5982\u53bb\u566a\uff09\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u770b\u4f3c\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u4f55\u65f6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u4f4e\u5c42\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u6709\u76ca\u3002", "method": "1. \u5efa\u7acb\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7d27\u5bc6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff1b2. \u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3. \u5206\u6790\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u9884\u5904\u7406\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b4. \u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\uff1b5. \u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0a\u7814\u7a76\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "1. \u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u9884\u5904\u7406\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3. \u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1b4. \u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u3001\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5982\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, their high inference latency and memory consumption pose significant challenges for real-time serving and scalability. These limitations stem largely from architectural redundancy, particularly in the attention module. The inherent parameter redundancy of the attention mechanism, coupled with the fact that its attention heads operate with a degree of independence, makes it particularly amenable to structured model compression. In this paper, we propose SHRP (Specialized Head Routing and Pruning), a novel structured pruning framework that automatically identifies and removes redundant attention heads while preserving most of the model's accuracy and compatibility. SHRP introduces Expert Attention, a modular design that treats each attention head as an independent expert, followed by a lightweight shared expander feed-forward network that refines their outputs. The framework employs a unified Top-1 usage-driven mechanism to jointly perform dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning at deployment. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark using a BERT-base encoder show that SHRP achieves 93% of the original model accuracy while reducing parameters by 48 percent. Under an extreme compression scenario where 11/12 of the layers are pruned, the model still maintains 84% accuracy and delivers a 4.2x throughput gain while reducing computation to as low as 11.5 percent of the original FLOPs, demonstrating its practical utility for large-scale and latency-sensitive web deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "SHRP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5171\u4eab\u6269\u5c55\u5668\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u90e8\u7f72\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSHRP\uff08Specialized Head Routing and Pruning\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5171\u4eab\u6269\u5c55\u5668\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\u7cbe\u70bc\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684Top-1\u4f7f\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u526a\u679d\u3002", "result": "\u5728GLUE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528BERT-base\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1a1\uff09\u8fbe\u5230\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b93%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1148%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u538b\u7f29\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff08\u526a\u966411/12\u5c42\uff09\uff0c\u4ecd\u4fdd\u630184%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b04.2\u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u964d\u81f3\u539f\u59cbFLOPs\u768411.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "SHRP\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u7684Web\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Existing studies address this impairment using technology-specific definitions, models, and mitigation approaches, which hinders cross-domain comparison and transferable design insight. This survey provides a unified treatment of pointing errors across optical and high frequency wireless communications. We establish consistent terminology and a cross-technology taxonomy of pointing errors, review angular misalignment and statistical distribution models, and analyze their impact on system performance. Mitigation techniques are systematically surveyed with emphasis on optical systems and their connection to underlying pointing error models. The survey further provides a detailed examination of pointing-error effects in orbital angular momentum (OAM) links and quantum optical communications, and surveys the corresponding mitigation approaches tailored to mode-dependent impairments and quantum measurement constraints. The survey also outlines open challenges and future research directions. By consolidating fragmented literature into a coherent framework, this work supports consistent analysis and robust design of next generation directional communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u5149\u5b66\u3001\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u548c\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8de8\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u672f\u8bed\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8c03\u7814\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u6280\u672f\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5b9a\u5411\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u672f\u8bed\u548c\u8de8\u6280\u672f\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u89d2\u5ea6\u5931\u51c6\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8c03\u7814\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u94fe\u8def\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u6548\u5e94\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\u635f\u4f24\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u76f8\u5e94\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5206\u6563\u7684\u6587\u732e\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5b9a\u5411\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e09\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u914d\u5bf9\u914d\u5bf9\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u9884\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u540c\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u7b54\u6848\uff09\u3001\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u95ee\u9898\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u3001\u603b\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u9075\u5faa\u5168\u65b9\u5dee\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff09\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5168\u914d\u5bf9\u914d\u5bf9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6240\u6709LLM\u5bf9\u5e94\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u95ee\u9898\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u6d4b\u91cf\u6240\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u603b\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u914d\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u5e38\u8d85\u8fc7\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u610f\u5473\u7740\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u9884\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u65e0\u9700\u5b9a\u5236\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5373\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We attribute this to the Attention Suppression Hypothesis: during pre-training, some deep attention layers learn to mute their own contribution, leaving the residual stream and the MLP to carry the representation. We propose Gate-Norm, a one-shot, weight-only criterion that ranks attention sublayers by query--key coupling and removes the least coupled ones, requiring no calibration data, no forward passes, no fine-tuning, and no specialized kernels. On 40-layer, 13B-parameter LLaMA models, Gate-Norm prunes the model in under a second. Pruning $8$--$16$ attention sublayers yields up to $1.30\\times$ higher inference throughput while keeping average zero-shot accuracy within $2\\%$ of the unpruned baseline across BoolQ, RTE, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy/Challenge, and OpenBookQA.

In recent years, Semantic Communication (SemCom) has represented a transformative communication paradigm that prioritizes meaning-level transmission over conventional bit-level delivery, thus providing improved spectrum efficiency, anti-interference ability in complex environments, flexible resource allocation, and enhanced user experience for RAN. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive reviews on the integration of SemCom into RAN. Motivated by this, we systematically explore recent advancements in Semantic RAN (SemRAN). We begin by introducing the fundamentals of RAN and SemCom, identifying the limitations of conventional RAN, and outlining the overall architecture of SemRAN. Subsequently, we review representative techniques of SemRAN across physical layer, data link layer, network layer, and security plane. Furthermore, we envision future services and applications enabled by SemRAN, alongside its current standardization progress.

However, many emerging applications must operate in GPS-denied environments where signals are unreliable or disrupted, resulting in oscillator drift and carrier frequency impairments. To address these challenges, we present BenchLink, a System-on-Chip (SoC)-based benchmark for resilient communication links that functions without GPS and supports adaptive pilot density and modulation. Unlike traditional General Purpose Processor (GPP)-based software-defined radios (e.g. USRPs), the SoC-based design allows for more precise latency control.

However, their practical application is limited by the scalability of current quantum hardware. In this paper, we introduce the mathematical paradigm of DRQC into classical models by proposing a quantum-inspired data re-uploading network (Q-RUN), which retains the Fourier-expressive advantages of quantum models without any quantum hardware. Experimental results demonstrate that Q-RUN delivers superior performance across both data modeling and predictive modeling tasks. Compared to the fully connected layers and the state-of-the-art neural network layers, Q-RUN reduces model parameters while decreasing error by approximately one to three orders of magnitude on certain tasks. Notably, Q-RUN can serve as a drop-in replacement for standard fully connected layers, improving the performance of a wide range of neural architectures.

We develop a deployment-first, operations-aware view of RIS-enabled satellite networking that treats RIS as both satellite/terminal antennas and inter-satellite or space-ground relays. We show that system-level gains are governed by two unifying mechanisms: connectivity restoration via virtual line-of-sight links that preserve connectivity under blockage and mobility, and angular selectivity that reshapes interference to enlarge spectrum reuse. We further discuss practical operation under high mobility, highlighting Delay-Doppler channel acquisition, predictive beam tracking, and control designs that budget overhead and latency, and summarize hardware considerations for reliable operation in space.

Model-based optical proximity correction (OPC) and inverse lithography technique (ILT) remain indispensable but computationally expensive, requiring repeated simulations that limit scalability. Although deep learning has been applied to mask optimization, existing datasets often rely on synthetic layouts, disregard standard-cell hierarchy, and neglect the surrounding contexts around the mask optimization targets, thereby constraining their applicability to practical mask optimization. To advance deep learning for cell- and context-aware mask optimization, we present MaskOpt, a large-scale benchmark dataset constructed from real IC designs at the 45$\\mathrm{nm}$ node. MaskOpt includes 104,714 metal-layer tiles and 121,952 via-layer tiles. Each tile is clipped at a standard-cell placement to preserve cell information, exploiting repeated logic gate occurrences.

We consider a downlink scenario where a base station (BS) with an active rotatable array serves multiple communication users and senses low-altitude targets, assisted by a rotatable reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). A rotation-aware geometry-based multipath model is developed to capture the impact of three-dimensional (3D) array orientations on both steering vectors and direction-dependent element gains. On this basis, we formulate a new optimization problem that maximizes the downlink sum rate subject to a transmit power budget, RIS unit-modulus constraints, mechanical rotation limits, and a sensing beampattern mean-squared-error (MSE) constraint. To address the resulting highly non-convex problem, we propose a penalty-based alternating-optimization (AO) framework that alternately updates the BS precoder, RIS phase shifts, and BS/RIS array rotation angles. The three blocks are efficiently handled via a convex optimization method based on quadratic-transform (QT) and majorization-minorization (MM), Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) on the unit-modulus manifold, and projected gradient descent (PGD) with Barzilai-Borwein step sizes, respectively. Numerical results in low-altitude geometries demonstrate that the proposed jointly rotatable BS-RIS architecture achieves significant sum-rate gains over fixed or partially rotatable baselines while guaranteeing sensing requirements, especially with directional antennas and in interference-limited regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6c\u6709\u6e90\u548c\u65e0\u6e90\u9635\u5217\u7684\u4f4e\u7a7a\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ad9\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001RIS\u76f8\u79fb\u548c\u9635\u5217\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u548c\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u611f\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u9635\u5217\u5728\u4f4e\u7a7a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u6709\u6e90\u9635\u5217\u548cRIS\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u7a7aISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528QT\u548cMM\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u65b0BS\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1b2) \u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u6a21\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u9ece\u66fc\u5171\u8f6d\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0RIS\u76f8\u79fb\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u5e26Barzilai-Borwein\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u66f4\u65b0BS/RIS\u9635\u5217\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u5408\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6cBS-RIS\u67b6\u6784\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u611f\u77e5\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u548c\u901f\u7387\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5929\u7ebf\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6e90\u9635\u5217\u3001RIS\u76f8\u79fb\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6cBS-RIS\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u7a7aISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u611f\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4f4e\u7a7a\u901a\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This development is creating an unprecedented spaceborne GNSS network, offering new opportunities for network-driven precise LEO orbit and clock estimation. Yet, current onboard GNSS processing is largely standalone and often insufficient for high-precision applications, while centralized fusion is challenging due to computational bottlenecks and the lack of in-orbit infrastructure. In this work, we report a decentralized GNSS network over large-scale LEO constellations, where each satellite processes its own measurements while exchanging compact information with neighboring nodes to enable precise orbit and time determination. We model the moving constellation as a dynamic graph and tailor a momentum-accelerated gradient tracking (GT) method to ensure steady convergence despite topology changes. Numerical simulations with constellations containing hundreds of satellites show that the proposed method matches the accuracy of an ideal centralized benchmark, while substantially reducing communication burdens. Ultimately, this framework supports the development of autonomous and self-organizing space systems, enabling high-precision navigation with reduced dependence on continuous ground contact.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LEO\u661f\u5ea7\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316GNSS\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u536b\u661f\u95f4\u4ea4\u6362\u7d27\u51d1\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u8f68\u9053\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LEO\u661f\u5ea7\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\uff0c\u6570\u5343\u9897\u536b\u661f\u642d\u8f7dGNSS\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u5f62\u6210\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u661f\u8f7dGNSS\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u661f\u4e0a\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u878d\u5408\u53c8\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u661f\u4e0a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u79fb\u52a8\u661f\u5ea7\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9a\u5236\u52a8\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u68af\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u6bcf\u9897\u536b\u661f\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u8eab\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u90bb\u8fd1\u8282\u70b9\u4ea4\u6362\u7d27\u51d1\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5305\u542b\u6570\u767e\u9897\u536b\u661f\u7684\u661f\u5ea7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5339\u914d\u7406\u60f3\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u4e3b\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bfc\u822a\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6301\u7eed\u5730\u9762\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

However, when generating from multi-concept prompts, one concept token often dominates the generation, suppressing the others-a phenomenon we term the Dominant-vs-Dominated (DvD) imbalance. To systematically analyze this imbalance, we introduce DominanceBench and examine its causes from both data and architectural perspectives. Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps. In addition, head ablation studies show that the DvD behavior arises from distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads. Our findings provide key insights into generative collapse, advancing toward more reliable and controllable text-to-image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u7684\"\u4e3b\u5bfcvs\u88ab\u4e3b\u5bfc\"\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DominanceBench\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6210\u56e0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5206\u5e03\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3b\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u6291\u5236\u5176\u4ed6\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3aDvD\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DominanceBench\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76DvD\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6210\u56e0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6709\u9650\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6807\u8bb0\u4f1a\u8fc5\u901f\u9971\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e76\u5728\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4e2d\u9010\u6e10\u6291\u5236\u5176\u4ed6\u6807\u8bb0\uff1bDvD\u884c\u4e3a\u6e90\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u5d29\u6e83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

The study aims to evaluate the interference risk with other wireless systems, and electromagnetic safety of a private 5G network in the 3.9-4.1 GHz band, while ensuring compatibility with legacy wireless systems, such as LTE and Wi-Fi. We conducted a measurement campaign, employing state-of-the-art instrumentation and a methodology that combined high resolution and long-duration spectrum scans. The results demonstrate no measurable interference between the hospital's private 5G network with adjacent LTE (4G) or Wi-Fi bands, confirming the spectral isolation of the 5G transmissions, and vise versa. Additionally, RF exposure levels in the operating room were found to be well below ICNIRP, WHO, and IEEE safety thresholds, ensuring that the network poses negligible biological risk to patients and hospital staff. The study also proposes spectrum management strategies for private 5G networks in hospitals, focusing on adaptive sensing and guardband planning. These findings provide a solid foundation for the integration of private 5G infrastructure in hospitals environments, supporting digital transformation in patient care without compromising electromagnetic compatibility or patient safety. The results also contribute to ongoing discussions around private 5G network deployments in sensitive sectors and provide actionable guidelines for future hospitals' wireless systems planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u533b\u9662\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u90e8\u7f72\u79c1\u67095G\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u57283.9-4.1GHz\u9891\u6bb5\u4e0b\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709LTE\u548cWi-Fi\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4e14\u5c04\u9891\u66b4\u9732\u6c34\u5e73\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u533b\u7597\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\uff0c\u533b\u9662\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u652f\u6301\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u82ac\u5170\u5965\u5362\u5927\u5b66\u533b\u9662\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u90e8\u7f72\u79c1\u67095G\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u7535\u78c1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u60a3\u8005\u548c\u533b\u62a4\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0e\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u9891\u8c31\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u9662\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u79c1\u67095G\u7f51\u7edc\u57283.9-4.1GHz\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u7535\u78c1\u66b4\u9732\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1\uff09\u79c1\u67095G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u76f8\u90bbLTE\uff084G\uff09\u548cWi-Fi\u9891\u6bb5\u4e4b\u95f4\u65e0\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff1b2\uff09\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u5185\u7684\u5c04\u9891\u66b4\u9732\u6c34\u5e73\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8eICNIRP\u3001WHO\u548cIEEE\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9608\u503c\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u5e26\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5728\u533b\u9662\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u79c1\u67095G\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u673a\u6784\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u79c1\u67095G\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u3002"}}

Highly directional beams utilized to overcome the attenuation in these frequencies necessitate robust and efficient beamforming schemes. Nevertheless, antenna and beam management approaches still face challenges in highly mobile solutions, such as vehicular connectivity, with increasing number of bands. In this work, the concepts of spectrum mobility is studied along with antenna array management in multiple frequencies to improve beamforming under mobility. The spectrum mobility problem aims to select the optimal channel frequency and beam direction in each time slot to maximize data rate. This problem is formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and Point-Based Value Iteration (PBVI) algorithm is used to find a policy with performance guarantees.

This sequential and adaptive nature enables the program to be modeled as a business process, thereby facilitating its analysis.

To address these limitations, this work proposes an architecture based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for the synthesis of realistic clinical records that are coherent with real-world observations. The primary objective is to increase the size and diversity of the available datasets in order to enhance the performance of cardiac risk prediction models and to reduce the need for potentially hazardous diagnostic procedures, such as exercise stress testing.

Michael Buehrer"], "title": "Neural Network-Assisted RIS Weight Optimization for Spatial Nulling in Distorted Reflector Antenna Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have recently been proposed as an effective means for spatial interference suppression in large reflector antenna systems. Existing RIS weight optimization algorithms typically rely on accurate theoretical radiation models. However, in practice, distortions on the reflector antenna may cause mismatches between the theoretical and true antenna patterns, leading to degraded interference cancellation performance when these weights are directly applied. In this report, a residual learning network-assisted simulated annealing (ResNet-SA) framework is proposed to address this mismatch without requiring explicit knowledge of the distorted electric field. By learning the residual difference between the theoretical and true antenna gains, a neural network (NN) is embedded in a heuristic optimization algorithm to find the optimal weight vector. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves improved null depth in the true radiation pattern as compared with conventional methods that optimize weights based solely on the theoretical model, validating the effectiveness of the ResNet-SA algorithm for reflector antenna systems with approximate knowledge of the pattern.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faResNet-SA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\u4e2d\u7406\u8bba\u5929\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5929\u7ebf\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5e72\u6270\u6291\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u53cd\u5c04\u9762\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5929\u7ebf\u53d8\u5f62\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7406\u8bba\u5929\u7ebf\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u7684RIS\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e72\u6270\u6291\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\uff08ResNet-SA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5929\u7ebf\u589e\u76ca\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5929\u7ebf\u589e\u76ca\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\u5411\u91cf\uff1b3\uff09\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u4e86\u89e3\u5931\u771f\u7535\u573a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f90\u5c04\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u7684\u96f6\u9677\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ResNet-SA\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ResNet-SA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u53cd\u5c04\u9762\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5e72\u6270\u6291\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u4e86\u89e3\u5931\u771f\u7535\u573a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Mainstream consistency-based fusion inherently minimizes feature discrepancies to align modalities, yet this approach fundamentally fails because it inadvertently smoothes out the subtle cross-modal contradictions that serve as the primary evidence of fabrication. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions. First, DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance. Second, we employ physics-inspired feature dynamics to iteratively polarize these representations, actively extracting maximally informative conflicts. Finally, a conflict-consensus mechanism standardizes these local discrepancies against the global context for robust deliberative judgment.Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets demonstrate that DCCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 3.52\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "DCCF\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bfb\u6c42\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\u6781\u5316\u3001\u51b2\u7a81-\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77db\u76fe\u800c\u975e\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u8bef\u5224\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u7a00\u91ca\u4e86\u4f2a\u9020\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u4e3b\u6d41\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5374\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e86\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f2a\u9020\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u51b2\u7a81-\u5171\u8bc6\u6846\u67b6(DCCF)\uff1a1) \u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u5931\u8c03\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\u8fed\u4ee3\u6781\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u6700\u5927\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff1b3) \u51b2\u7a81-\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5ba1\u8bae\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDCCF\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53473.52%\u3002", "conclusion": "DCCF\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bfb\u6c42\u548c\u653e\u5927\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u800c\u975e\u6291\u5236\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u4f2a\u9020\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

However, the substantial computational requirements for training these models present a significant obstacle to their practical application. To address this issue, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed. Nevertheless, the standard LoRA with a fixed rank lacks sufficient capability for training mobile VLMs that process both text and image modalities. In this work, we introduce HyDRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework designed to implement hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling for mobile VLMs. This framework incorporates two essential optimization strategies: (1) hierarchical optimization, which involves a coarse-grained approach that assigns different ranks to various layers, as well as a fine-grained method that adjusts ranks within individual layers, and (2) dynamic adjustment, which employs an end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks during the fine-tuning process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HyDRA consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving a 4.7\\% improvement across various model sizes without increasing the number of trainable parameters.

Recent work leverages contrastive vision language models (VLMs) to obtain dense, domain-agnostic rewards without human supervision. These methods adapt VLMs into reward models through increasingly complex learning objectives, yet meaningful comparison remains difficult due to differences in training data, architectures, and evaluation settings. In this work, we isolate the impact of the learning objective by evaluating recent VLM-based reward models under a unified framework with identical backbones, finetuning data, and evaluation environments. Using Meta-World tasks, we assess modeling accuracy by measuring consistency with ground truth reward and correlation with expert progress. Remarkably, we show that a simple triplet loss outperforms state-of-the-art methods, suggesting that much of the improvements in recent approaches could be attributed to differences in data and architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684VLM\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd1\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u800c\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8fd1\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u83b7\u5f97\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u5c06VLM\u9002\u914d\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd1\u671f\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u73af\u5883\u6765\u9694\u79bb\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Meta-World\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5efa\u6a21\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd1\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6539\u8fdb\u53ef\u80fd\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u635f\u5931\uff09\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd9\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u636e\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding increasingly memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference throughput rather than arithmetic computation. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks. This reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic, yielding up to $10^{3}\\times$ higher throughput per unit memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "PHOTON\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u5782\u76f4\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bbf\u95ee\u66ff\u4ee3\u5e73\u9762\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u62a4\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u51cf\u5c11KV\u7f13\u5b58\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b010\u00b3\u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "Transformer\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6c34\u5e73token-by-token\u626b\u63cf\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\u7684token\u7ea7\u72b6\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8fd9\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u9884\u586b\u5145\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u7801\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u53d7\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\uff0cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u8bfb\u5199\u4e3b\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u7b97\u672f\u8ba1\u7b97", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u884c\u5206\u5c42\u64cd\u4f5c\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7f51\u7edc(PHOTON)\uff0c\u7528\u5782\u76f4\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bbf\u95ee\u66ff\u4ee3\u5e73\u9762\u626b\u63cf\u3002\u7ef4\u62a4\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9010\u6b65\u5c06token\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u4f4e\u901f\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u5efa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6token\u8868\u793a", "result": "PHOTON\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf-\u8d28\u91cf\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u89e3\u7801\u65f6KV\u7f13\u5b58\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bcf\u5355\u4f4d\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u8fbe10\u00b3\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "PHOTON\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Transformer\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u573a\u666f"}}

Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code. FEM-Bench 2025 contains a suite of introductory but nontrivial tasks aligned with material from a first graduate course on computational mechanics. These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them. In a five attempt run, the best performing model at function writing, Gemini 3 Pro, completed 30/33 tasks at least once and 26/33 tasks all five times. The best performing model at unit test writing, GPT-5, had an Average Joint Success Rate of 73.8%. Other popular models showed broad performance variation.

Understanding the stability and robustness of these models is crucial for optimizing their training, architecture, and real-world applicability. This paper presents an analysis of Lipschitz properties in multimodal autoencoders, combining both theoretical insights and empirical validation to enhance the training stability of these models. We begin by deriving the theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods within the multimodal autoencoder framework. We then introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method, developed based on our theoretical analysis, which demonstrates improved stability and performance during training. Through a series of experiments, we empirically validate our theoretical findings by estimating the Lipschitz constants across multiple trials and fusion strategies. Our results demonstrate that our proposed fusion function not only aligns with theoretical predictions but also outperforms existing strategies in terms of consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy.

Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLVR\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4SFT\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u8db3\u591f\u521d\u59cb\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u624d\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u8fb9\u9645\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6982\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76RLVR\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7406\u89e3RLVR\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6982\u7387\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u522b\uff08\u5173\u8054\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff09\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5728Qwen-2.5-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\uff083B-32B\uff09\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83RLVR\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "RLVR\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u522b\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u6bd4SFT\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u540c\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u8de8\u7ea7\u522b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1bRLVR\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8db3\u591f\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u8fb9\u9645\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e2d\u95f4\u6982\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "RLVR\u80fd\u591f\u6539\u5584\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5b50\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u76ca\u5904\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u8db3\u591f\u521d\u59cb\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u624d\u4f1a\u663e\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3aRLVR\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

This crisis is driven by information leakage due to overlapping training and test sets across different models, as well as the illegitimate transfer of global patterns to test data. While the ability to learn shared temporal dynamics represents a primary strength of these models, their evaluation on historical archives often permits the exploitation of observed global shocks, which violates the independence required for valid benchmarking. We introduce TS-Arena, a platform that restores the operational integrity of forecasting by treating the genuinely unknown future as the definitive test environment. By implementing a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams, the platform ensures that evaluation targets remain physically non-existent during inference, thereby enforcing a strict global temporal split.

While Pad\u00e9 approximants combined with scaling and squaring have long served as the standard, recent Taylor-based methods, which utilize polynomial evaluation schemes that surpass the classical Paterson--Stockmeyer technique, offer superior accuracy and reduced computational complexity. This paper presents an optimized Taylor-based algorithm for the matrix exponential, specifically designed for the high-throughput requirements of generative AI flows. We provide a rigorous error analysis and develop a dynamic selection strategy for the Taylor order and scaling factor to minimize computational effort under a prescribed error tolerance.

This research bridges the gap between mechanistic physics and data driven learning by establishing a novel dual specialist ensemble framework that disentangles vulnerability into two distinct vectors, environmental contagion and structural fragility. The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience. Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework reveals a critical dichotomy in risk drivers. The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology.

The core idea of \\texttt{FedMPDD} is to encode each client's high-dimensional gradient by computing its directional derivatives along multiple random vectors. This compresses the gradient into a much smaller message, significantly reducing uplink communication costs from $\\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m \\ll d$. The server then decodes the aggregated information by projecting it back onto the same random vectors. Our key insight is that averaging multiple projections overcomes the dimension-dependent convergence limitations of a single projection. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing that \\texttt{FedMPDD} converges at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$, matching the performance of FedSGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method provides some inherent privacy against gradient inversion attacks due to the geometric properties of low-rank projections, offering a tunable privacy-utility trade-off controlled by the number of projections.

Block low-rank (BLR) compression techniques address this challenge by learning compact representations of weight matrices. While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST. On memory-constrained NVIDIA GPUs such as Jetson Orin Nano and A40, our kernels deliver up to $3.76\\times$ speedups and $3\\times$ model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines using CUDA backend and compiler-level optimizations, while supporting various models including Llama-7/1B, GPT2-S, DiT-XL/2, and ViT-B.

However, using a single encoder to produce a fixed embedding ignores the representation trajectory formed by a pretrained diffusion model across network hierarchies and noise timesteps, where clusterability varies substantially. We propose DiEC (Diffusion Embedded Clustering), which performs unsupervised clustering by directly reading internal activations from a pretrained diffusion U-Net.\n  DiEC formulates representation selection as a two-dimensional search over layer x timestep, and exploits a weak-coupling property to decompose it into two stages. Specifically, we first fix the U-Net bottleneck layer as the Clustering-friendly Middle Layer (CML), and then use Optimal Timestep Search (OTS) to identify the clustering-optimal timestep (t*). During training, we extract bottleneck features at the fixed t* and obtain clustering representations via a lightweight residual mapping. We optimize a DEC-style KL self-training objective, augmented with adaptive graph regularization and entropy regularization to strengthen cluster structures.

The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, a dataset is created comprising problem-agnostic graph features and hardness classifications of problem instances. Machine-learning-based classification algorithms are trained to map graph features to hardness categories. In the second stage, the framework explains the predictions using an association rule mining algorithm. Additionally, machine-learning-based regression models are trained to predict algorithmic computation times. The GCO-HPIF framework was applied to a dataset of 3287 maximum clique problem instances compiled from the COLLAB, IMDB, and TWITTER graph datasets using five state-of-the-art algorithms, namely three exact branch-and-bound-based algorithms (Gurobi, CliSAT, and MOMC) and two graph-neural-network-based algorithms (EGN and HGS). The framework demonstrated excellent performance in predicting instance hardness, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.9921, a minority-class F1 score of 0.878, and an ROC-AUC score of 0.9083 using only three graph features. The best association rule found by the FP-Growth algorithm for explaining the hardness predictions had a support of 0.8829 for hard instances and an overall accuracy of 87.64 percent, underscoring the framework's usefulness for both prediction and explanation. Furthermore, the best-performing regression model for predicting computation times achieved a percentage RMSE of 5.12 and an R2 value of 0.991.", "AI": {"tldr": "GCO-HPIF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u56fe\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5206\u7c7b\u9884\u6d4b+\u5173\u8054\u89c4\u5219\u89e3\u91ca\uff09\u5728\u6700\u5927\u56e2\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u5ea6\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f88\u8017\u65f6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\u96be\u5ea6\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u521b\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5173\u8054\u89c4\u5219\u6316\u6398\uff08FP-Growth\uff09\u89e3\u91ca\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e3287\u4e2a\u6700\u5927\u56e2\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f7f\u75285\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\uff083\u79cd\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5+2\u79cd\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff1a\u4ec5\u75283\u4e2a\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u5c31\u8fbe\u5230\u52a0\u6743F1\u5206\u65700.9921\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u7c7bF1\u5206\u65700.878\uff0cROC-AUC\u5206\u65700.9083\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u5173\u8054\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u56f0\u96be\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u652f\u6301\u5ea6\u4e3a0.8829\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u738787.64%\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u767e\u5206\u6bd4RMSE\u4e3a5.12\uff0cR\u00b2\u503c\u4e3a0.991\u3002", "conclusion": "GCO-HPIF\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5927\u56e2\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU.", "AI": {"tldr": "RevFFN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eMoE\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006Transformer\u5757\u91cd\u6784\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4f7f\u5355GPU\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u91cf\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5f53\u4ee3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLMs\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u591aGPU\u6216CPU\u5378\u8f7d\u7f13\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRevFFN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9006Transformer\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ece\u8f93\u51fa\u91cd\u6784\u5c42\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u5b58\u50a8\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301MoE\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u6216\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "RevFFN\u4e3aMoE\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5355GPU\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u3002"}}

The approach blends seasonal time-series models with tree-based learners, runs Monte Carlo scenario tests to map risk envelopes, and solves a constrained optimization that enforces business guardrails on customer experience, margin floors, and allowable churn. Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance. Managerially, the framework functions as a strategy playbook that clarifies when to shift from flat to dynamic pricing, how to align pricing with CLV and MRR targets, and how to embed ethical guardrails, enabling durable growth without eroding customer trust.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8425\u9500\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba2\u9605\u5b9a\u4ef7\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u6709\u62a4\u680f\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u7ec6\u5206\u4ef7\u683c\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u6d41\u5931\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u5165\u3001\u5229\u6da6\u548c\u7559\u5b58\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7ec6\u5206\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u5165\u635f\u5931\u6216\u5ba2\u6237\u6d41\u5931\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u4ef7\u683c\u654f\u611f\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u5ba2\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u573a\u666f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed8\u5236\u98ce\u9669\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5ba2\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3001\u5229\u6da6\u5e95\u7ebf\u548c\u5141\u8bb8\u6d41\u5931\u7387\u7b49\u4e1a\u52a1\u62a4\u680f\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316API\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f02\u6784SaaS\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u5c42\u7ea7\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ef7\u683c\u8c03\u6574\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u5230\u652f\u4ed8\u610f\u613f\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7ec6\u5206\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u4ef7\u683c\u654f\u611f\u5ba2\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6218\u7565\u624b\u518c\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u4f01\u4e1a\u4f55\u65f6\u4ece\u56fa\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4ef7\u8f6c\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e0e\u5ba2\u6237\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u6708\u5ea6\u7ecf\u5e38\u6027\u6536\u5165\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5d4c\u5165\u9053\u5fb7\u62a4\u680f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u5ba2\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002"}}

However, open-source multi-fidelity datasets and empirical guidelines linking dataset size to model performance remain limited. This study investigates the relationship between training data size and prediction accuracy for a graph neural network (GNN) based surrogate model for aerodynamic field prediction. We release an open-source, multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset for double-delta wings, comprising 2448 flow snapshots across 272 geometries evaluated at angles of attack from 11 (degree) to 19 (degree) at Ma=0.3 using both Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers. The geometries are generated using a nested Saltelli sampling scheme to support future dataset expansion and variance-based sensitivity analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary empirical scaling study of the MF-VortexNet surrogate by constructing six training datasets with sizes ranging from 40 to 1280 snapshots and training models with 0.1 to 2.4 million parameters under a fixed training budget. We find that the test error decreases with data size with a power-law exponent of -0.6122, indicating efficient data utilization. Based on this scaling law, we estimate that the optimal sampling density is approximately eight samples per dimension in a d-dimensional design space. The results also suggest improved data utilization efficiency for larger surrogate models, implying a potential trade-off between dataset generation cost and model training budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u53cc\u4e09\u89d2\u7ffc\u6c14\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5bf9\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7f29\u653e\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5448\u5e42\u5f8b\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u8f66\u8f86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "1) \u53d1\u5e03\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u53cc\u4e09\u89d2\u7ffc\u6c14\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b272\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u572811\u00b0-19\u00b0\u653b\u89d2\u4e0b\u76842448\u4e2a\u6d41\u573a\u5feb\u7167\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528VLM\u548cRANS\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u5d4c\u5957Saltelli\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff1b3) \u6784\u5efa6\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\uff0840-1280\u4e2a\u5feb\u7167\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b4) \u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec30.1-240\u4e07\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u7684MF-VortexNet\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff1b5) \u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "1) \u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u5448\u5e42\u5f8b\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u6307\u6570\u4e3a-0.6122\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff1b2) \u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7ea6\u4e3ad\u7ef4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6bcf\u7ef4\u5ea68\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff1b3) \u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u7b97\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6c14\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f66\u8f86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) enhances this process by enabling multi-objective optimization and exploration of novel chemical space - capabilities that traditional supervised learning methods lack. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{ReACT-Drug}, a fully integrated, target-agnostic molecular design framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Unlike models requiring target-specific fine-tuning, ReACT-Drug utilizes a generalist approach by leveraging ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify similar proteins for a given target from a knowledge base such as Protein Data Base (PDB). Thereafter, the known drug ligands corresponding to such proteins are decomposed to initialize a fragment-based search space, biasing the agent towards biologically relevant subspaces. For each such fragment, the pipeline employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent guiding a ChemBERTa-encoded molecule through a dynamic action space of chemically valid, reaction-template-based transformations.

Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance. Our experiments show that agentic AI that relies on generic analytics workflow falls short of methods that use domain-specific insights.

We analyze the distinctions between memorization and generalization in diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. By investigating a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder (DAE), we prove that (i) memorization corresponds to the model storing raw training samples in the learned weights for encoding and decoding, yielding localized \"spiky\" representations, whereas (ii) generalization arises when the model captures local data statistics, producing \"balanced\" representations. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical findings on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the same representation structures emerge in deep generative models with significant practical implications. Building on these insights, we propose a representation-based method for detecting memorization and a training-free editing technique that allows precise control via representation steering.

However, classical BRL methods assume known forms of transition and reward models, reducing their applicability in real-world problems. As a result, recent deep BRL methods have started to incorporate model learning, though the use of neural networks directly on the joint data and task parameters requires optimising the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). ELBOs are difficult to optimise and may result in indistinctive task parameters, hence compromised BRL policies. To this end, we introduce a novel deep BRL method, Generalised Linear Models in Deep Bayesian RL with Learnable Basis Functions (GLiBRL), that enables efficient and accurate learning of transition and reward models, with fully tractable marginal likelihood and Bayesian inference on task parameters and model noises. On challenging MetaWorld ML10/45 benchmarks, GLiBRL improves the success rate of one of the state-of-the-art deep BRL methods, VariBAD, by up to 2.7x. Comparing against representative or recent deep BRL / Meta-RL methods, such as MAML, RL2, SDVT, TrMRL and ECET, GLiBRL also demonstrates its low-variance and decent performance consistently.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGLiBRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728MetaWorld\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5df2\u77e5\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u53c2\u6570\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316ELBO\uff0c\u4f46ELBO\u96be\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u7b56\u7565\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGLiBRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u4f3c\u7136\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u907f\u514dELBO\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728MetaWorld ML10/45\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGLiBRL\u5c06\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5VariBAD\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe2.7\u500d\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982MAML\u3001RL2\u3001SDVT\u3001TrMRL\u548cECET\uff0cGLiBRL\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GLiBRL\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5143\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The proposed model can effectively identify correlated segments in such matrices, better than previous approaches for similar problems. Internally, the proposed model utilizes an overlapping technique and uses pre-trained Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which makes it robust and generalizable. CoSeNet approach also includes a method that optimizes the parameters of the re-scaling layer using a heuristic algorithm and fitness based on a Window Difference-based metric.

Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCSD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u745e\u58eb\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u914d\u5bf9\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff1b2\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7ade\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u6807\u8f6c\u5411\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6392\u540d\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u745e\u58eb\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff08CSD\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u8f6e\u987a\u5e8f\u7ade\u8d5b\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7d2f\u79ef\u80dc\u8d1f\u8bb0\u5f55\u5728\u7cbe\u9009\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u914d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\uff0810\u4e07\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u7edf\u8ba1\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u671f\u671b\u83b7\u80dc\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u968f\u673a\u914d\u5bf9\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u8fd0\u6c14\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff1b3\uff09\u5b9e\u65bd\u5931\u8d25\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6bcf\u8f6e\u6dd8\u6c70\u6570\u91cf\u6765\u533a\u5206\u7a33\u5065\u901a\u624d\u548c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u4e13\u624d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "CSD\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u805a\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u9759\u6001\u914d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5411\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002", "conclusion": "CSD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7ade\u4e89\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7ade\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The method builds a shared encoding structure to represent diverse monitoring indicators in a unified manner and employs a state fusion mechanism to capture trend changes and local disturbances across different time scales. A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity. The results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several error metrics and provides more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions.

Kevrekidis", "Eleni Chatzi"], "title": "A Mechanistic Analysis of Transformers for Dynamical Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Transformers are increasingly adopted for modeling and forecasting time-series, yet their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood from a dynamical systems perspective. In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5355\u5c42Transformer\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u5ea6\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u4e0e\u5177\u6709\u6210\u719f\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cTransformer\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u8003\u8651\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6216\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0csoftmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u51f8\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u8868\u793a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u632f\u8361\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5145\u5f53\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5d4c\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f53\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5c06\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3Transformer\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4f55\u65f6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u6210\u529f\u6216\u5931\u8d25\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model.

The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem showing that uniform boundedness of these stability signatures is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy that dissipates along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals. The resulting framework provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how architectural and algorithmic choices jointly govern robustness and sensitivity to perturbations.

However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces.

In this paper, we focus on optimizing a representative class of attacks that search for the optimal ray direction yielding the minimum $\\ell_2$-norm perturbation required to move a benign image into the adversarial region. Inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), we propose a momentum-based algorithm, ARS-OPT, which proactively estimates the gradient with respect to a future ray direction inferred from accumulated momentum. We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance.

Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a \"cross-task heterogeneity\" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk.

While precision medicine has introduced mutation-specific therapies, many patients still lack effective, personalized options. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end computational framework that bridges the gap between patient-specific transcriptomics and de novo drug discovery. By analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-LAML cohort, the study utilized Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to prioritize 20 high-value biomarkers, including metabolic transporters like HK3 and immune-modulatory receptors such as SIGLEC9. The physical structures of these targets were modeled using AlphaFold3, and druggable hotspots were quantitatively mapped via the DOGSiteScorer engine. Then developed a novel, reaction-first evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm as well as multi-objective optimization programming that assembles novel ligands from fragment libraries, guided by spatial alignment to these identified hotspots. The generative model produced structurally unique chemical entities with a strong bias toward drug-like space, as evidenced by QED scores peaking between 0.5 and 0.7. Validation through ADMET profiling and SwissDock molecular docking identified high-confidence candidates, such as Ligand L1, which achieved a binding free energy of -6.571 kcal/mol against the A08A96 biomarker. These results demonstrate that integrating systems biology with metaheuristic molecular assembly can produce pharmacologically viable, patient tailored leads, offering a scalable blueprint for precision oncology in AML and beyond", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e0e\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5206\u5b50\u7ec4\u88c5\uff0c\u4e3aAML\u60a3\u8005\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u836f\u7269\u5148\u5bfc\u5316\u5408\u7269", "motivation": "AML\u5177\u6709\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u590d\u53d1\u7387\uff0c\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u5b66\u867d\u7136\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7a81\u53d8\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7597\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u60a3\u8005\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u9009\u62e9", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528WGCNA\u5206\u6790TCGA-LAML\u961f\u5217\u7684RNA\u6d4b\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b20\u4e2a\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff1b2) \u7528AlphaFold3\u5efa\u6a21\u9776\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b3) \u7528DOGSiteScorer\u5f15\u64ce\u5b9a\u91cf\u6620\u5c04\u53ef\u6210\u836f\u70ed\u70b9\uff1b4) \u5f00\u53d1\u53cd\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ece\u7247\u6bb5\u5e93\u7ec4\u88c5\u65b0\u914d\u4f53", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u72ec\u7279\u5316\u5b66\u5b9e\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u836f\u7269\u6837\u7a7a\u95f4\u504f\u5411\u6027\uff08QED\u8bc4\u52060.5-0.7\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ADMET\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u5bf9\u63a5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5982\u914d\u4f53L1\u5bf9A08A96\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u4e3a-6.571 kcal/mol", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e0e\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5206\u5b50\u7ec4\u88c5\u7684\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u836f\u7406\u5b66\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u5b9a\u5236\u5148\u5bfc\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u4e3aAML\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u80bf\u7624\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u84dd\u56fe"}}

This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations.
