However, this sequential design approach does not fully\naddress the trade-offs between high-frequency and LDO-induced low-frequency\nphase noise. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a co-design\nmethod for low phase-noise LC-tank VCOs powered by LDOs. It is difficult to\ncarry out the co-design using traditional manual design techniques. Hence, an\nefficient AI-driven EDA algorithm is used. To validate the proposed method, a\n5.6 GHz LC-tank VCO with an integrated LDO is designed using a 65 nm CMOS\nprocess.

In this paper, we present\nECGTwin, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges. In the\nfirst stage, an Individual Base Extractor trained via contrastive learning\nrobustly captures personal features from a reference ECG.

However, existing\nspectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal\naccuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To\novercome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed\nSpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative\nspectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the\nmulti-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both\nfine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the\nspectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning\ntasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are\ndeveloped for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and\ntransferable representations.

In this setting, each\ndecision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial\nlogit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have\nsimultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However,\nmotivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop\nalgorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy\nupdates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and\nRS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,\nrespectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update\nrounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can\nchoose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion. Our first\nalgorithm, B-MNL-CB extends the notion of distributional optimal designs to the\nmultinomial setting and achieves $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret assuming the\ncontexts are generated stochastically when presented with $\\Omega(\\log \\log T)$\nupdate rounds. Our second algorithm, RS-MNL works with adversarially generated\ncontexts and can achieve $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\\tilde{O}(\\log T)$\npolicy updates. Further, we conducted experiments that demonstrate that our\nalgorithms (with a fixed number of policy updates) are extremely competitive\n(and often better) than several state-of-the-art baselines (which update their\npolicy every round), showcasing the applicability of our algorithms in various\npractical scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, existing\ntoken-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their\nirreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns\nduring decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both\nmarginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the\ncollective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal\ninformation over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two\ncompensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices\nbetween LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted\ncompensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention\nmatching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in\nperceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller\nmodel's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger\nmodel. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and\nLongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV.

Despite recent\nadvances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures\nbased on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static\ndecomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion\nmechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To\nexplicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel\nDynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch\nDecomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale\nRouting MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in\ncomponent to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with\nexponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints\nthrough input-adaptive patch adjustment.

Submitted to IEEE", "summary": "Orthogonal signaling limits the number of information symbols transmitted in\nbandwidth $B$ and time $T$ to be $BT$. This corresponds to the Nyquist\nsignaling and is achieved by mounting information symbols on $BT$-dimensional\nbasis spanning the $BT$-dimensional space spaced $\\frac{1}{B}$ and\n$\\frac{1}{T}$ apart. Faster-than-Nyquist signaling involves transmitting more\nthan $BT$ informational symbols in a $BT$-dimensional space. This leads to loss\nof orthogonality. This is achieved by time and/or bandwidth expansion resulting\nfrom packing more information symbols in the same $BT$-dimensional space\n(spacing less than $\\frac{1}{B}$ and/or $\\frac{1}{T}$). In this paper, we take\na different approach to faster-than-Nyquist signaling. We propose to\nsuperimpose the information symbols on one another maintaining the original\nspacing in the Nyquist signaling. We carry this out in the delay-Doppler (DD)\ndomain using Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS)\nmodulation. In Zak-OTFS, the channel varies slowly. Further Zak-OTFS also\nallows construction of mutually unbiased bases the interference between which\nappear like Gaussian noise. The proposed scheme leverages the slow variation in\nthe DD channel to construct a precoder that mitigates the effect of the\ndoubly-spread channel. Further, in the proposed scheme we mount information\nsymbols on two mutually unbiased bases which allows superposition of\ninformation symbols.

We show that GRPO update rule in fact\nestimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one.\nHowever, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy\nbetween the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We\nvalidate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is\nentirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient\nestimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps.

Radar technologies offer a promising sensing\nmodality for material recognition task. When combined with deep learning, radar\ntechnologies have demonstrated strong potential in identifying the material of\nvarious objects. However, existing radar-based solutions are often constrained\nto closed-set object categories and typically require task-specific data\ncollection to train deep learning models, largely limiting their practical\napplicability.

Answering this question is non-trivial due\nto the inherent redundancy of radar signals and the fact that pre-trained LLMs\nhave no prior exposure to raw radar data during training. To address this, we\nintroduce LLMaterial, the first study to investigate the feasibility of using\nLLM to identify materials directly from radar signals. First, we introduce a\nphysics-informed signal processing pipeline that distills high-redundancy radar\nraw data into a set of compact intermediate parameters that encapsulate the\nmaterial's intrinsic characteristics.

We derive new spectral\nefficiency (SE) expressions for the untrusted link and the monitoring system.\nFor the latter, the SE is derived for two CSI availability cases at the central\nprocessing unit (CPU); namely case-1: imperfect CSI knowledge at both MNs and\nCPU, case-2: imperfect CSI knowledge at the MNs and no CSI knowledge at the\nCPU.

Numerical results show that (a) our CF-mMIMO proactive monitoring\nsystem relying on the proposed CSI acquisition and optimization approach\nsignificantly outperforms the considered benchmarks; (b) the MSP performance of\nour CF-mMIMO proactive monitoring system is greater than 0.8, regardless of the\nnumber of antennas at the untrusted nodes or the precoding scheme for the\nuntrusted transmission link.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e0\u5c0f\u533a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\uff08CF-mMIMO\uff09\u4e3b\u52a8\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff08CSI\uff09\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u76d1\u63a7\u8282\u70b9\uff08MNs\uff09\u6709\u6548\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u901a\u4fe1\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u5bfc\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MMSE\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u83b7\u53d6\u6709\u6548\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CF-mMIMO\u4e3b\u52a8\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u76d1\u63a7\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\uff08MSP\uff09\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14MSP\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc70.8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CSI\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

DTDD enables the CF mMIMO system to\nconcurrently serve both uplink~(UL) and downlink~(DL) users with spatially\nseparated \\emph{half-duplex~(HD)} access points~(APs) using the same\ntime-frequency resources. Further, to facilitate ISAC, the UL APs are utilized\nfor both UL data and target echo reception, while the DL APs jointly transmit\nthe precoded DL data streams and target signal. In this context, we present\ncentralized and distributed generalized likelihood-ratio tests~(GLRTs) for\ntarget detection treating UL users' signals as sensing interference. We then\nquantify the optimality and complexity trade-off between distributed and\ncentralized GLRTs and benchmark the respective estimators with the Bayesian\nCram\\'er-Rao lower bound for target radar-cross section~(RCS). Then, we present\na unified framework for joint UL users' data detection and RCS estimation.\nNext, for communication, we derive the signal-to-noise-plus-interference~(SINR)\noptimal combiner accounting for the cross-link and radar interference for UL\ndata processing. In DL, we use regularized zero-forcing for the users and\npropose two types of precoders for the target: one ``user-centric\" that\nnullifies the interference caused by the target signal to the DL users and one\n``target-centric\" based on the dominant eigenvector of the composite channel\nbetween the target and the APs. Finally, numerical studies corroborate with our\ntheoretical findings and reveal that the \\emph{GLRT is robust to inter-AP\ninterference, and DTDD doubles the $90\\%$-likely sum UL-DL SE compared to\ntraditional TDD-based CF-mMIMO ISAC systems}; while using HD hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u5206\u53cc\u5de5\uff08DTDD\uff09\u65e0\u5c0f\u533a\uff08CF\uff09\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\uff08mMIMO\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ISAC\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7DTDD\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u670d\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u884c\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u884cAP\u8fdb\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fGLRT\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0eRCS\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6700\u4f18SINR\u5408\u5e76\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u76ee\u6807\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86GLRT\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548cDTDD\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u5206\u53cc\u5de5\u7684\u65e0\u5c0f\u533a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfTDD\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fGLRT\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0eRCS\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff1b4. \u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18SINR\u5408\u5e76\u5668\uff1b5. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u76ee\u6807\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGLRT\u5bf9AP\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0cDTDD\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u534a\u53cc\u5de5\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfTDD\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "DTDD\u548cGLRT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a\nstructure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of\nconventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware\naugmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and\nsemantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation.\nFurthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing\nobjectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture\nlong-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph\ncontrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without\ncompromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the\neffectiveness of HiTeC.", "AI": {"tldr": "HiTeC\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u8d85\u56fe\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u8d85\u56fe\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5ffd\u7565\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u8d85\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3001\u968f\u673a\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002HiTeC\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "HiTeC\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eHiTeC\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u8d85\u56fe\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HiTeC\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u679c\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

The gold score for a target class is supposed to\nbe 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes\nthe training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the\n\"target-approach-1\" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all\nsamples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already\nbeen classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply\nrequires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve\nthe above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which\ndesigns a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For\nmore purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores\ncompared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on\nlearning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is\nalso the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of\neasy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive\ngradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up\ntraining. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,\ntext multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio\nclassification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+.

This advancement is underpinned by the concept\nof Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training\ndata enhances learning performance.

This review addresses this gap by\nsystematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,\nand training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data\nefficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the\nrelationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we\ninvestigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,\nensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which\ncollectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational\nchallenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of\ndistributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary\ntraining on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these\nstrategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in\nadvancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future\nresearch.

As a result, researchers have attempted to\nadapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing\nextra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the\nsuperior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their\nbase KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this\npaper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods\nand then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our\nresults show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of\nHKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods\nalter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.\nMoreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in\ncapturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate\nmain-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.\nTo further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE\nresearch, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a\nqualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based\ngraph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an\nimproved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to\nmitigate compression issues.

This issue arises from key data challenges, including a\nmajor asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data\navailable for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer\nfor Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this\nasymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed\nweather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict\nrich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking.

Traditional numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) models represent the state-of-the-art in forecasting\nperformance but rely on computationally costly data assimilation and solving\ncomplicated partial differential equations (PDEs) that simulate atmospheric\nphysics. Here, we introduce SolarSeer, an end-to-end large artificial\nintelligence (AI) model for solar irradiance forecasting across the Contiguous\nUnited States (CONUS). SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical\nsatellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational\noverhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows\nSolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating\n24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer\nresolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the\nCONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly\nreduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%\nin reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively\ncaptures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the\nfirst-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy.

Reproducibility in machine learning\nevaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground\ntruth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,\namong whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has\nstudied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as\nis typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for\ncollecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more\nsamples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the\nper-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of\nitems ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable\nmachine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical\ndatasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated\ndistributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$\nconfiguration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation\ndata and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our\nfindings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N\n\\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested\non at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \\times K$ almost always\noccurred for $K > 10$.

To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):\nan asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and\ngenerates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer\nand solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a\nreward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives\na reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of\nground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests\nwhich are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework\non three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the\nOMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually\ngenerating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language\nmodels can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated\ntraining datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSQLM\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u63d0\u95ee\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u81ea\u6211\u535a\u5f08\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u5c31\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u81ea\u6211\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u63d0\u95ee\u8005\u548c\u89e3\u7b54\u8005\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u95ee\u8005\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u89e3\u7b54\u8005\u5c1d\u8bd5\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u89e3\u7b54\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4f4d\u6570\u4e58\u6cd5\u3001OMEGA\u4ee3\u6570\u95ee\u9898\u548cCodeforces\u7f16\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u89e3\u7b54\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Inverse reinforcement\nlearning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from\ndemonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice\npolicy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like\nautonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we\nneed not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal\nguarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability\nguarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically\nselecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce\nPAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets\nprobably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --\nproviding the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert\ndemonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the\napprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further\ndemonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the\nreward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,\nwe prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic\nmethods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPAC-EIG\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u83b7\u53d6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08IRL\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9bPAC\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edfIRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPAC-EIG\u548cReward-EIG\u4e24\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u83b7\u53d6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u9488\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9057\u61be\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "PAC-EIG\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8IRL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}
