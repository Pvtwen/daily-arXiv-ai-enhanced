A commonly used model\nassumes that the data matrices are noisy observations of low-rank matrices with\na shared singular subspace.

The first approach, termed Stack-SVD, concatenates all the\ndatasets, and then performs a singular value decomposition (SVD). The second\napproach, termed SVD-Stack, first performs an SVD separately for each dataset,\nthen aggregates the top singular vectors across these datasets, and finally\ncomputes a consensus amongst them.

Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative\nreinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,\nfreely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by\nhaving access to a \"simulator\". By employing known classical and new quantum\nalgorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within\nour learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms\nfrom RL like \"optimism in the face of uncertainty\" and \"posterior sampling\" and\ninstead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret\nbounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum\nalgorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number\nof time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This\nmatches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.\n(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other\nparameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$.

Standard RL algorithms\ntypically are based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that\nthe current state of the environment provides all the necessary information for\nsystem evolution and decision-making. However, this Markovian assumption is\ninvalid in many practical scenarios, making the MDP and RL frameworks\ninadequate to produce the optimal solutions. Additionally, traditional RL\nalgorithms often employ function approximations (e.g., by neural networks) that\ndo not explicitly capture the spatial relationships inherent in environments\nwith complex network topologies.

In this paper, we revisit\nhypernetwork-based methods and leverage their strong generalization\ncapabilities to design a simple yet effective framework for heterogeneous\npersonalized federated learning. Specifically, we propose MH-pFedHN, which\nleverages a server-side hypernetwork that takes client-specific embedding\nvectors as input and outputs personalized parameters tailored to each client's\nheterogeneous model. To promote knowledge sharing and reduce computation, we\nintroduce a multi-head structure within the hypernetwork, allowing clients with\nsimilar model sizes to share heads.

Recent studies utilizing\nbit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial\ntraining complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose\nMemory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that\naddresses these limitations.

It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs,\nenabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter\nsplitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the\nsimultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.\nExperimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable\nparameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous\nbit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression\nrates.

However, unaligned samples across different parties in\nVFL can be extremely class-imbalanced, leading to insufficient feature\nrepresentation and limited model prediction space. Specifically,\nclass-imbalanced problems consist of intra-party class imbalance and\ninter-party class imbalance, which can further cause local model bias and\nfeature contribution inconsistency issues, respectively. To address the above\nchallenges, we propose Proto-EVFL, an enhanced VFL framework via dual\nprototypes. We first introduce class prototypes for each party to learn\nrelationships between classes in the latent space, allowing the active party to\npredict unseen classes. We further design a probabilistic dual prototype\nlearning scheme to dynamically select unaligned samples by conditional optimal\ntransport cost with class prior probability. Moreover, a mixed prior guided\nmodule guides this selection process by combining local and global class prior\nprobabilities. Finally, we adopt an \\textit{adaptive gated feature aggregation\nstrategy} to mitigate feature contribution inconsistency by dynamically\nweighting and aggregating local features across different parties.

While many methods compress neural network\nparameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To\naddress this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)\nframework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian\nfunction to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the\ncomputational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we\nintroduce Gr\\\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the\nfractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each\nkernel in FGF is minimized to only seven.

In our proposed method the hyperparameters can be optimised\ndirectly on the unlabelled data to which the trained classifier must be\napplied; this is unlike traditional model selection methods, that are based on\nperforming cross-validation on the labelled training data.

Generative modeling based on density operator models\n(\\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such\nas those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,\nsuch as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a\nfundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable\nmodels on real-world datasets. \\textit{In this paper, we develop an\nExpectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined\nthrough \\textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those\nused for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,\ndesigning such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined\nquantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation\nstep. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum\ninformation projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map\nprovides a solution under sufficient conditions.
