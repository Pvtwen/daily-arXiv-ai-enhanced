A formal argument allows us to\ninterpret this asymptotic variance as the dissipation of a gradient flow of a\nsuitable energy with respect to the Fisher-Rao geometry. This geometric\ninterpretation allows us to give, in turn, a statistical interpretation of the\nasymptotic variance in terms of a Cramer-Rao lower bound for the estimation of\nthe eigenvalues of certain weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator. The latter\ninterpretation suggests a form of asymptotic statistical efficiency for the\neigenvalues of the graph Laplacian.

This research explores how RL,\nparticularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop\nautonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.\n  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning\nproblem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings within a simulated financial environment.

A core aspect of MABs is the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to\nbe enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear\nbandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the\nsame linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration\nstrategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is\nincreasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration\nbehavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of\nseveral linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy\nlinear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier\nperformance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts.

In the human\nstudy, 51 healthy young participants performed balance tasks on the BM in\ncombination with an FP to evaluate the BM's validity. Sway metrics such as sway\nmean, sway absolute mean, sway root mean square (RMS), sway path, sway range,\nand sway velocity were calculated from both BM and FP and compared. Reliability\nwas evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), where values\ngreater than 0.9 were considered excellent and values between 0.75 and 0.9 were\nconsidered good. Results from the robot study demonstrated good to excellent\nICC values in both single and double-leg stances. The human study showed\nmoderate to strong correlations for sway path and range. Using Bland-Altman\nplots for agreement analysis revealed proportional bias between the BM and the\nFP where the BM overestimated sway metrics compared to the FP.

While existing research on GNN\nrobustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced\nfaults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress\ntoward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency\ndemands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can\ncause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major\ntechnology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a\ncomprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to\nreveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and\nefficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and\nlightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.\nSpecifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out\noutliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these\nprotective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any\nmessage-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively\nenhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error\npatterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of\n$3\\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction\naccuracy by at least 20\\% when errors present in model weights or node\nembeddings, and by at least 10\\% when errors occur in adjacency matrices.

Previous ML\nmodels typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a\ntrained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed\nReynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of\nPDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of\nscales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more\nconcretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters\nand the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to\nrepresent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given\ndomain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a\nscale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a\ngiven domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.\nSince neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the\nnatural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of\nneural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the\nscale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,\nHelmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations.

Then, LIGHT designs individual\nintrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational\ntransformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action\npreferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nrepresentative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability\nacross different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "LIGHT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u548cMARL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2a\u4f53\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u4e2d\u56e2\u961f\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u4e2a\u4f53\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLIGHT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4f18\u5316Q\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLIGHT\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "LIGHT\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0eMARL\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Conventional\ndesign flows, which often rely on manual or heuristics-based optimization, are\nlimited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this\npaper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the\nautomatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically\nmultipliers.\n  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two\nstages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised\nfinetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area\nfrom abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model,\nGENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize\npower consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.\nExtensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently\nmore sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards\noptimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis\noptimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.\nNotably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%\nswitching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads\ncompared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the\nversatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite\nState Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of\nlogic functions.

This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG)\ntechnique, which converts time series data into networks by representing\nmeasurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network\nis constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data\nsequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid\nexpensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is\ndirectly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study.\nWe assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical\nnonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency.\nCompared to an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and\ncomparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent\nperformance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff08DyRC-VG\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u56fe\u6280\u672f\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u50a8\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08RC\uff09\u7684\u968f\u673a\u50a8\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u548c\u8fc7\u5927\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u56fe\uff08VG\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684VG\u7f51\u7edc\u6784\u5efa\u50a8\u5c42\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5728Duffing\u632f\u8361\u5668\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDyRC-VG\u6bd4\u76f8\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi\u56fe\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DyRC-VG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u76f4\u63a5\u6784\u5efa\u50a8\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

First, it is interpretable for\nlife detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as\nbuilding blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history.\nSecond, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be\nphysically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from\nother approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular\ncomplexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass\nspectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints. To address\nthis, we developed a machine learning model that predicts molecular assembly\nwith high accuracy, reducing error by three-fold compared to baseline models.\nSimulated data shows that even small instrumental inconsistencies can double\nmodel error, emphasizing the need for standardization.

While\nempirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple\nobjective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work\nintroduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to\ndeconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the\nsingle-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category\nStoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,\nallows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes\nthree main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic\nrationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,\nquantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods\nexploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn\nnot just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a\nprocess we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we\nprove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive\nlearning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,\nwe show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align\nwith the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a\ngeometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs.

Additionally, the unprecedented success\nof recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that\ntechnology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been\ndeveloped. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how\nthese technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to\nsociety in broader areas.
