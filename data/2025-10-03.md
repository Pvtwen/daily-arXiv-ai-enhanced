*Tao Han,Ang Li,Qinyu Chen,Chang Gao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: JaneEye是一种基于事件相机的节能眼动追踪硬件加速器，专为可穿戴设备设计，通过轻量级神经网络架构和硬件优化，实现了高精度、低延迟和低功耗的眼动追踪。


<details>

Result: 在3ET+数据集上达到2.45像素误差的高精度，仅使用17.6K参数，事件帧率高达1250 Hz。12nm ASIC实现400MHz工作频率，端到端延迟0.5ms（相当于2000 FPS），能效为18.9μJ/帧。

Conclusion: JaneEye为下一代XR可穿戴设备设定了低功耗、高性能眼动追踪解决方案的新基准。

Abstract: Eye tracking has become a key technology for gaze-based interactions in
Extended Reality (XR). However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems
often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency,
and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering
ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we
present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware
accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse,
high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural
network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the
traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving
computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our
proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+
dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To
further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of
activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization.
Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at
400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames
Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\mu$J/frame. JaneEye sets a
new benchmark in low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable
for integration into next-generation XR wearables.

### [2] [Satellite Assignment Policy Learning for Coexistence in LEO Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01408)
*Jeong Min Kong,Ian P. Roberts*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图结构学习的算法，用于推断低地球轨道卫星系统中主系统的卫星分配策略，以帮助次系统在不干扰主用户的情况下运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非独占频段的LEO卫星系统中，次系统需要避免对主用户造成过度干扰，但主系统的卫星分配策略未公开，因此需要开发方法来推断这些策略。

Method: 基于有限的历史数据，提出端到端的图结构学习算法，学习最高仰角主卫星分配策略，能够直接将主卫星坐标映射为对主用户的分配决策。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法优于最佳基线，预测准确率提高了约15%。

Conclusion: 所提出的图结构学习方法能有效推断主系统的卫星分配策略，为次系统的频谱接入提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Unlike in terrestrial cellular networks, certain frequency bands for
low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems have thus far been allocated on a
non-exclusive basis. In this context, systems that launch their satellites
earlier (referred to as primary systems) are given spectrum access priority
over those that launch later, known as secondary systems. For a secondary
system to function, it is expected to either coordinate with primary systems or
ensure that it does not cause excessive interference to primary ground users.
Reliably meeting this interference constraint requires real-time knowledge of
the receive beams of primary users, which in turn depends on the primary
satellite-to-primary user associations. However, in practice, primary systems
have thus far not publicly disclosed their satellite assignment policies;
therefore, it becomes essential for secondary systems to develop methods to
infer such policies. Assuming there is limited historical data indicating which
primary satellites have served which primary users, we propose an end-to-end
graph structure learning-based algorithm for learning highest elevation primary
satellite assignment policies, that, upon deployment, can directly map the
primary satellite coordinates into assignment decisions for the primary users.
Simulation results show that our method can outperform the best baseline,
achieving approximately a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy.

*Hibatallah Alwazani,Omran Abbas,Loic Markley,Anas Chaaban*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了延迟增强堆叠智能表面(DA-SIS)概念，通过在SIS中引入符号级延迟单元，使其具备时空信号处理能力，可作为模拟均衡器消除多径干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SIS技术主要用于空间波域信号处理，但缺乏时间维度处理能力。通过增加延迟单元，可以扩展SIS的功能，使其能够同时进行时空信号处理。

Method: 在堆叠智能表面中集成可调延迟单元，构建DA-SIS系统。将其作为模拟均衡器应用，通过分析误码率来评估不同元素数量对均衡性能的影响。

Result: DA-SIS能够有效消除多径引起的符号间干扰，在均衡性能方面与数字均衡器相当，展示了其在信号处理中的潜力。

Conclusion: 延迟增强堆叠智能表面为HMIMO和umMIMO技术提供了新的可能性，未来需要进一步研究以实现这一概念的实用化。

Abstract: Stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS)s have been proposed recently as an
enabling technology for Holographic Multiple Input Multiple Output (HMIMO) and
Ultra-massive MIMO (umMIMO) technologies. Their utility can extend beyond
spatial wave-domain processing of signals if they are enhanced with
strategically-tuned symbol-duration level delays to enable temporal processing
as well. In this work, we introduce the idea of a delay-augmented SIS (DA-SIS).
We shed light on the feasibility of realizing delay units in an SIS. Then, we
discuss the relevance of the proposed DA-SIS and present a use case that
illustrates its potential, wherein the DA-SIS serves as an analog equalizer
that aids in eliminating multi-path-induced inter-symbol-interference (ISI). We
show how the number of elements affect the equalization process using the bit
error rate (BER) as a metric, and demonstrate the potential of the DA-SIS in
equalization via comparing with digital equalizers as a benchmark. Finally, we
present opportunities and future research directions that can be undertaken to
bring this idea to fruition.

### [4] [A Drone-mounted Magnetometer System for Automatic Interference Removal and Landmine Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01417)
*Alex Paul Hoffmann,Matthew G. Finley,Eftyhia Zesta,Mark B. Moldwin,Lauro V. Ojeda*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于无人机双磁力计的有效地雷探测方法，通过两步算法消除无人机电子设备干扰并检测地雷信号


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地雷在冲突地区广泛使用，对平民构成持续威胁，阻碍战后重建。现有无人机磁力计探测方法面临电子设备干扰的技术挑战

Method: 使用框架安装的双磁力计载荷，采用WAIC-UP方法消除干扰，然后使用RUDE算法检测地雷特征

Result: 该方法在蒙特卡洛模拟中验证了高保真度弹药检测，计算成本低，简化了磁力测量载荷设计，并在不同飞行高度下评估了算法性能

Conclusion: WAIC-UP/RUDE两步方法能够有效解决无人机磁力计探测中的干扰问题，实现可靠的地雷检测

Abstract: Landmines have been extensively used in conflict zones as an indiscriminate
weapon to control military movements, often remaining active long after
hostilities have ended. Their presence poses a persistent danger to civilians,
hindering post-war recovery efforts, causing injuries or death, and restricting
access to essential land for agriculture and infrastructure. Unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAV) equipped with magnetometers are commonly used to detect remnant
hidden landmines but come with significant technical challenges due to magnetic
field interference from UAV electronics such as motors. We propose the use of a
frame-mounted UAV-borne two-magnetometer payload to perform a two-step
automated interference removal and landmine detection analysis. The first step
removes interference via the Wavelet-Adaptive Interference Cancellation for
Underdetermined Platform (WAIC-UP) method designed for spaceflight
magnetometers. The second method uses the Rapid Unsupervised Detection of
Events (RUDE) algorithm to detect landmine signatures. This two-step
WAIC-UP/RUDE approach with multiple magnetometers achieves high-fidelity
ordinance detection at a low computational cost and simplifies the design of
magnetic survey payloads. We validate the method through a Monte Carlo
simulation of randomized landmine placements in a 10 x 10 m square grid and
drone motor interference. Additionally, we assess the efficacy of the algorithm
by varying the drone's altitude, examining its performance at different heights
above the ground.

### [5] [Meta-Learning-Driven Resource Optimization in Full-Duplex ISAC with Movable Antennas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01437)
*Ali Amhaz,Shreya Khisa,Mohamed Elhattab,Chadi Assi,Sanaa Sharafeddine*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于可移动天线的全双工基站系统，在同时服务上下行用户的同时实现目标检测感知功能，通过联合优化波束成形、用户功率和天线位置来最大化回波信干噪比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究集成感知与通信(ISAC)技术，利用可移动天线(MAs)提升全双工基站系统的性能，在保证通信服务质量的同时优化感知功能。

Method: 采用基于梯度的元学习(GML)方法来解决非凸且变量高度耦合的优化问题，联合优化发射波束成形、接收波束成形、用户发射功率和天线位置。

Result: 数值结果表明所提出的元学习方法能达到最优解的99%性能，且基于可移动天线的方案优于多个基准方法。

Conclusion: 基于可移动天线的方案在实际ISAC应用中具有显著优势，证明了所提优化方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates a full-duplex (FD) scenario where a base station (BS)
equipped with movable antennas (MAs) simultaneously provides communication
services to a set of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users while also enabling
sensing functionalities for target detection, thereby supporting integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) technology. Additionally, a receiving BS, also
equipped with MAs (denoted as BS R), is responsible for capturing the reflected
echo. To optimize this setup, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at
maximizing the signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SINR) of the captured
echo. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors
at the FD BS, the receiving beamforming vectors at both the FD BS and BS R, the
UL users' transmit power, and the MAs' positions at both BSs, all while
satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for both sensing and
communication. Given the non-convex nature of the problem and the high coupling
between the variables, we employ a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) approach
tailored for large-scale optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed meta-learning approach, achieving results within
99% of the optimal solution. Furthermore, the MA-based scheme outperforms
several benchmark approaches, highlighting its advantages in practical ISAC
applications.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对里德堡原子传感器的LODC-OFDM方案，解决了传统OFDM接收的限制，并通过Bussgang定理分析了非线性失真，实验验证了理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 里德堡原子传感器在射频测量中具有高灵敏度，但其光学接口的单极性特性限制了传统OFDM接收，因此需要开发兼容的信号传输方案。

Method: 建立了里德堡原子传感器的AM-AM特性经验近似函数，基于DCO-OFDM框架提出了LODC-OFDM方案，并采用Bussgang定理分析非线性失真。

Result: 推导了泰勒级数展开和理想预失真情况下的闭式解，实验结果显示理论与实验结果吻合良好。

Conclusion: LODC-OFDM方案有效解决了里德堡原子传感器的宽带OFDM接收挑战，为兼容信号传输提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors have been seen as novel radio frequency (RF)
measurements and the high sensitivity to a large range of frequencies makes it
attractive for communications reception. However, the signal sensing process in
Rydberg system involves sequential transduction from electromagnetic waves to
optical signals and finally to electrical signals. The unipolar characteristic
of the optical interface inherently restricts conventional OFDM reception.
Therefore, adopting unipolar OFDM schemes, inspired by optical communication
systems, becomes essential for compatible signal transmission. In this work, we
investigate the amplitude modulation-to-amplitude modulation (AM-AM)
characteristics of Rydberg atomic sensors, establishing an empirical
approximation function. Building on the direct current-biased optical
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) framework, we propose a
novel local oscillator direct current-biased OFDM (LODC-OFDM) scheme
specifically optimized for Rydberg-based sensing, effectively addressing the
broadband OFDM reception challenge. Then, we adopt Bussgang theorem to analyze
the nonlinear distortion of LODC-OFDM signals and the results in closed-form
solutions are derived for AM/AM curves approximated by Taylor series expansion
and for the ideal pre-distortion case. In real experiments, the experimental
and theoretical results fit well.

*Giusy Spacone,Sebastian Frey,Mattia Orlandi,Pierangelo Maria Rapa,Victor Kartsch,Simone Benatti,Luca Benini,Andrea Cossettini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种超低功耗（低于50mW）系统，融合8通道表面肌电信号和4通道A模式超声信号，用于连续跟踪手部和腕部的23个自由度，通过轻量级编码器-解码器架构实现多任务学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于生物信号的手势识别系统存在功耗高、不适合多日使用的问题，且仅限于离散手势分类。需要开发更节能、能够连续跟踪手势的系统。

Method: 使用超低功耗系统同时采集8通道EMG和4通道A模式US信号，集成到完全可穿戴的干接触臂带中。采用轻量级编码器-解码器架构进行多任务学习，同时估计手部和腕部关节角度。

Result: 在真实传感器重新定位条件下，EMG-US融合的均方根误差为10.6°±2.0°，优于单独的EMG（12.0°±1°）和US（13.1°±2.6°），R²得分为0.61±0.1，也优于单独模态。

Conclusion: EMG和US的传感器融合方法在连续手部和腕部跟踪方面表现出优越性能，为开发更自然、更可靠的人机交互系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Hand gesture recognition based on biosignals has shown strong potential for
developing intuitive human-machine interaction strategies that closely mimic
natural human behavior. In particular, sensor fusion approaches have gained
attention for combining complementary information and overcoming the
limitations of individual sensing modalities, thereby enabling more robust and
reliable systems. Among them, the fusion of surface electromyography (EMG) and
A-mode ultrasound (US) is very promising. However, prior solutions rely on
power-hungry platforms unsuitable for multi-day use and are limited to discrete
gesture classification. In this work, we present an ultra-low-power (sub-50 mW)
system for concurrent acquisition of 8-channel EMG and 4-channel A-mode US
signals, integrating two state-of-the-art platforms into fully wearable,
dry-contact armbands. We propose a framework for continuous tracking of 23
degrees of freedom (DoFs), 20 for the hand and 3 for the wrist, using a
kinematic glove for ground-truth labeling. Our method employs lightweight
encoder-decoder architectures with multi-task learning to simultaneously
estimate hand and wrist joint angles. Experimental results under realistic
sensor repositioning conditions demonstrate that EMG-US fusion achieves a root
mean squared error of $10.6^\circ\pm2.0^\circ$, compared to
$12.0^\circ\pm1^\circ$ for EMG and $13.1^\circ\pm2.6^\circ$ for US, and a R$^2$
score of $0.61\pm0.1$, with $0.54\pm0.03$ for EMG and $0.38\pm0.20$ for US.

Result: 获得了1比特量化SIMO-MRC系统的精确SEP表达式，确定了其分集和编码增益，并量化了SIMO-SC系统在任意接收天线数下的分集和编码增益。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展和补充了先前结果，为1比特量化SIMO系统提供了完整的性能分析框架，特别是在MRC和SC接收方案下的分集和编码增益特性。

Abstract: The average symbol error probability (SEP) of a 1-bit quantized single-input
multiple-output (SIMO) system is analyzed under Rayleigh fading channels and
quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation. Previous studies have
partially characterized the diversity gain for selection combining (SC). In
this paper, leveraging a novel analytical method, an exact analytical SEP
expression is derived for a 1-bit quantized SIMO system employing QPSK
modulation at the transmitter and maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the
receiver. The corresponding diversity and coding gains of a SIMO-MRC system are
also determined. Furthermore, the diversity and coding gains of a 1-bit
quantized SIMO-SC system are quantified for an arbitrary number of receive
antennas, thereby extending and complementing prior results.

*Hadi Zayyani,Felipe A. P. de Figueiredo,Mohammad Salman,Rausley A. A. de Souza*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的三维8元噪声调制方案，通过在混合高斯分布中引入概率维度，结合均值和方差维度，使每个传输符号携带3比特信息，数据率相比现有方案提高1.5-3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有噪声调制方案主要基于均值和方差两个维度，数据率有限。为了进一步提高数据率，需要引入新的调制维度。

Method: 使用混合高斯分布的概率作为第三维度，结合均值和方差构成三维调制。采用阈值检测器、最大似然检测器、峰度检测器和贝叶斯假设检测器分别检测三个子信道的比特。

Result: 仿真结果显示，第三子信道比特的误码率与现有二维方案相当，数据率相比广义二次噪声调制器和经典二元KLJN噪声调制器分别提高1.5倍和3倍。峰度检测器复杂度低，误码率约为0.06。

Conclusion: 提出的三维噪声调制方案成功引入了概率维度，在保持可接受误码率的同时显著提高了数据率，峰度检测器提供了低复杂度解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel three-dimensional (3D) 8-ary noise modulation
scheme that introduces a new dimension: the mixture probability of a Mixture of
Gaussian (MoG) distribution. This proposed approach utilizes the dimensions of
mean and variance, in addition to the new probability dimension. Within this
framework, each transmitted symbol carries three bits, each corresponding to a
distinct sub-channel. For detection, a combination of specialized detectors is
employed: a simple threshold based detector for the first sub-channel bit
(modulated by the mean), a Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detector for the second
sub-channel bit (modulated by the variance), a Kurtosis-based, Jarque-Bera (JB)
test, and Bayesian Hypothesis (BHT)-based detectors for the third bit
(modulated by the MoG probability). The Kurtosis- and JB-based detectors
specifically distinguish between Gaussian (or near-Gaussian) and non-Gaussian
MoG distributions by leveraging higher-order statistical measures. The Bit
Error Probabilities (BEPs) are derived for the threshold-, Kurtosis-, and
BHT-based detectors. The optimum threshold for the Kurtosis-based detector is
also derived in a tractable manner. Simulation results demonstrate that a
comparably low BEP is achieved for the third sub-channel bit relative to
existing two-dimensional (2D) schemes. Simultaneously, the proposed scheme
increases the data rate by a factor of 1.5 and 3 compared to the Generalized
Quadratic noise modulator and the classical binary KLJN noise modulator,
respectively. Furthermore, the Kurtosis-based detector offers a low-complexity
solution, achieving an acceptable BEP of approximately 0.06.

Conclusion: 该研究为Wasserstein距离约束下的鲁棒估计问题提供了理论分析和实用方法，通过有限维问题逼近无限维问题，并给出了可计算的鲁棒估计器。

Abstract: This paper primarily considers the robust estimation problem under
Wasserstein distance constraints on the parameter and noise distributions in
the linear measurement model with additive noise, which can be formulated as an
infinite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem. We prove that the existence of
a saddle point for this problem is equivalent to that for a finite-dimensional
minimax problem, and give a counterexample demonstrating that the saddle point
may not exist. Motivated by this observation, we present a verifiable necessary
and sufficient condition whose parameters can be derived from a convex problem
and its dual. Additionally, we also introduce a simplified sufficient
condition, which intuitively indicates that when the Wasserstein radii are
small enough, the saddle point always exists. In the absence of the saddle
point, we solve an finite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem, obtained by
restricting the estimator to be linear. Its optimal value establishes an upper
bound on the robust estimation problem, while its optimal solution yields a
robust linear estimator. Numerical experiments are also provided to validate
our theoretical results.

TL;DR: 提出通过叠加两个广义二次噪声调制器(GQNM)输出创建16进制噪声调制器，类似于经典通信中的QAM调制器。该方法通过选择满足理论可区分性条件的参数，在比特错误概率方面优于KLJN和GQNM调制器。

Motivation: 为了创建更高阶的噪声调制方案，提高通信系统的性能，特别是在比特错误概率方面超越现有的KLJN和GQNM调制器。

Method: 通过简单叠加两个GQNM调制器的输出创建16进制噪声调制器，在四个不同的均值和四个不同的方差上调制信息比特。选择满足理论可区分性条件的参数来优化性能。

Result: 仿真验证表明，该方法在比特错误概率(BEP)方面表现优于KLJN调制器和GQNM调制器，但需要增加调制器、发射器和接收器检测器的复杂度。

Conclusion: 提出的16进制噪声调制器通过叠加GQNM输出实现了更好的性能，该方法可扩展到更高阶调制方案，但需要权衡性能提升与系统复杂度增加的关系。

Abstract: This letter proposes superposing two Generalized Quadratic Noise Modulators
(GQNM) by simply adding their outputs. It creates a 16-ary noise modulator that
resembles QAM modulators in classical communication. It modulates the
information bits on four different means and four different variances. It could
also be applied to reach higher-order modulations than 16-ary schemes by adding
the outputs of more than two modulators, which is not discussed in detail in
this letter and left for future work. By selecting the parameters necessary for
satisfying the theoretical distinguishability conditions provided in the paper,
we can reach better performances in comparison to the Kirchhoff-Law Johnson
Noise (KLJN) modulator and the GQNM modulator, which is verified by the
simulations. The better result in terms of smaller Bit Error Probability (BEP)
is achieved by increasing the complexity in the modulator, the transmitter, and
the detectors in the receiver.

Conclusion: 结合多普勒和到达时间测量的定位算法能有效解决非凸优化问题，提供闭式解，且无人机轨迹设计也有闭式解，整体性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, a single Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle (UAV)-aided localization
algorithm which uses both Doppler and Time of Arrival (ToA) measurements is
presented. In contrast to Doppler-based localization algorithms which are based
on non-convex functions, exploiting ToA measurements in a Least-Square (LS)
Doppler-based cost function, leads to a quadratic convex function whose
minimizer lies on a line. Utilizing the ToA measurements in addition to the
linear equation of minimizer, a closed form solution is obtained for the
emitter location using a constrained LS optimization. In addition, a trajectory
design of the UAV is provided which has also closed-form solution. Simulation
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in
comparison to some others in the literature.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology offers a flexible approach to enhancing
wireless channel conditions by adjusting antenna positions within a designated
region. While most existing works focus on narrowband MA systems, this paper
investigates MA position optimization for an MA-enhanced multiple-input
single-output (MISO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system.
This problem appears to be particularly challenging due to the frequency-flat
nature of MA positioning, which should accommodate the channel conditions
across different subcarriers. To overcome this challenge, we discretize the
movement region into a multitude of sampling points, thereby converting the
continuous position optimization problem into a discrete point selection
problem. Although this problem is combinatorial, we develop an efficient
partial enumeration algorithm to find the optimal solution using a
branch-and-bound framework, where a graph-theoretic method is incorporated to
effectively prune suboptimal solutions. In the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
regime, a simplified graph-based algorithm is also proposed to obtain the
optimal MA positions without the need for enumeration. Simulation results
reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed-position
antennas (FPAs), while narrowband-based antenna position optimization can
achieve near-optimal performance.

Abstract: Capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive
noise is a critical issue in enhancing impulse noise processing for narrowband
powerline communication (NB-PLC) transceivers. However, existing mathematical
noise generative models capture only some of the characteristics of additive
noise. Therefore, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN), called the
noise-generation GAN (NGGAN), that learns the complicated characteristics of
practically measured noise samples for data augmentation. To closely match the
statistics of complicated noise in NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise
via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC
modem to build a realistic dataset. Specifically, the NGGAN design approaches
based on the practically measured dataset are as follows: (i) we design the
length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate
cyclo-stationary noise generation. (ii) Wasserstein distance is used as a loss
function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and the training
dataset and ensure that the sample diversity is sufficient for various
applications. (iii) To measure the similarity performance of the GAN-based
models based on mathematical and practically measured datasets, we perform
quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include (1) a
piecewise spectral cyclo-stationary Gaussian model (PSCGM), (2) a
frequency-shift (FRESH) filter, and (3) practical measurements from NB-PLC
systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NGGAN trained using
waveform characteristics is closer to the practically measured dataset in terms
of the quality of the generated noise.

Abstract: Inspired by Costa's pioneering work on dirty paper coding (DPC), this paper
proposes a novel scheme for integrated communication and computing (ICC), named
Computing on Dirty Paper, whereby the transmission of discrete data symbols for
communication, and over-the-air computation (AirComp) of nomographic functions
can be achieved simultaneously over common multiple-access channels. In
particular, the proposed scheme allows for the integration of communication and
computation in a manner that is asymptotically interference-free, by
precanceling the computing symbols at the transmitters (TXs) using DPC
principles. A simulation-based assessment of the proposed ICC scheme under a
single-input multiple-output (SIMO) setup is also offered, including the
evaluation of performance for data detection, and of mean-squared-error (MSE)
performance for function computation, over a block of symbols. The results
validate the proposed method and demonstrate its ability to significantly
outperform state-of-the-art (SotA) ICC schemes in terms of both bit error rate
(BER) and MSE.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为JMD的新范式，用于MIMO干扰器抑制，无需专用训练阶段，能够联合估计干扰器子空间并检测合法数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有干扰器抑制方法需要专用训练阶段，这会降低通信速率，且容易被智能或多天线干扰器规避

Result: 广泛的仿真证明了JMD在干扰器抑制方面的有效性

Conclusion: JMD方法消除了专用训练阶段的需求，能够有效应对智能和动态多天线干扰器

Abstract: Multi-antenna (or MIMO) processing is a promising solution to the problem of
jammer mitigation. Existing methods mitigate the jammer based on an estimate of
its spatial signature that is acquired through a dedicated training phase. This
strategy has two main drawbacks: (i) it reduces the communication rate since no
data can be transmitted during the training phase and (ii) it can be evaded by
smart or multi-antenna jammers that do not transmit during the training phase
or that dynamically change their subspace through time-varying beamforming. To
address these drawbacks, we propose Joint jammer Mitigation and data Detection
(JMD), a novel paradigm for MIMO jammer mitigation. The core idea of JMD is to
estimate and remove the jammer interference subspace jointly with detecting the
legitimate transmit data over multiple time slots. Doing so removes the need
for a dedicated and rate-reducing training period while being able to mitigate
smart and dynamic multi-antenna jammers. We provide two JMD-type algorithms,
SANDMAN and MAED, that differ in the way they estimate the channels of the
legitimate transmitters and achieve different complexity-performance tradeoffs.
Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of JMD for jammer mitigation.

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has garnered significant
attention due to its superior performance in high-mobility scenarios, coupled
with multiple waveform parameters that provide greater degrees of freedom for
system design. This paper introduces a novel secure affine frequency division
multiplexing (SE-AFDM) system, which advances prior designs by dynamically
varying an AFDM pre-chirp parameter to enhance physical-layer security. In the
SE-AFDM system, the pre-chirp parameter is dynamically generated from a
codebook controlled by a long-period pseudo-noise (LPPN) sequence. Instead of
applying spreading in the data domain, our parameter-domain spreading approach
provides additional security while maintaining reliability and high spectrum
efficiency. We also propose a synchronization framework to solve the problem of
reliably and rapidly synchronizing the time-varying parameter in fast
time-varying channels. The theoretical derivations prove that unsynchronized
eavesdroppers cannot eliminate the nonlinear impact of the time-varying
parameter and further provide useful guidance for codebook design. Simulation
results demonstrate the security advantages of the proposed SE-AFDM system in
high-mobility scenarios, while our hardware prototype validates the
effectiveness of the proposed synchronization framework.

Abstract: This paper investigates joint direction-of-arrival (DOA) and attitude sensing
using tri-polarized continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs). By employing
electromagnetic (EM) information theory, the spatially continuous received
signals in tri-polarized CAPA are modeled, thereby enabling accurate DOA and
attitude estimation. To facilitate subspace decomposition for continuous
operators, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation technique is
developed. Moreover, both self- and cross-covariances of tri-polarized signals
are exploited to construct a tri-polarized spectrum, significantly enhancing
DOA estimation performance. Theoretical analyses reveal that the
identifiability of attitude information fundamentally depends on the
availability of prior target snapshots. Accordingly, two attitude estimation
algorithms are proposed: one capable of estimating partial attitude information
without prior knowledge, and the other achieving full attitude estimation when
such knowledge is available. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and
superiority of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: 该框架实现了安全目标检测和估计，同时混淆未经授权的感知，无需窃听者的先验知识，分析了通信、合法感知和感知安全性之间的三方权衡。

Abstract: The deployment of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) brings along
unprecedented vulnerabilities to authorized sensing, necessitating the
development of secure solutions. Sensing parameters are embedded within the
target-reflected signal leaked to unauthorized passive radar sensing
eavesdroppers (Eve), implying that they can silently extract sensory
information without prior knowledge of the information data. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a sensing-secure ISAC framework that ensures secure
target detection and estimation for the legitimate system, while obfuscating
unauthorized sensing without requiring any prior knowledge of Eve. By
introducing artificial imperfections into the ambiguity function (AF) of ISAC
signals, we introduce artificial targets into Eve's range profile which
increase its range estimation ambiguity. In contrast, the legitimate sensing
receiver (Alice) can suppress these AF artifacts using mismatched filtering,
albeit at the expense of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss. Employing an OFDM
signal, a structured subcarrier power allocation scheme is designed to shape
the secure autocorrelation function (ACF), inserting periodic peaks to mislead
Eve's range estimation and degrade target detection performance. To quantify
the sensing security, we introduce peak sidelobe level (PSL) and integrated
sidelobe level (ISL) as key performance metrics. Then, we analyze the three-way
trade-offs between communication, legitimate sensing, and sensing security,
highlighting the impact of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC signaling on system
performance. We formulate a convex optimization problem to maximize ISAC
performance while guaranteeing a certain sensing security level. Numerical
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC
signaling, demonstrating its ability to degrade Eve's target estimation while
preserving Alice's performance.

Conclusion: 基于张量等变性的深度学习框架能有效解决SLP的高复杂度问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Although symbol-level precoding (SLP) based on constructive interference (CI)
exploitation offers performance gains, its high complexity remains a
bottleneck. This paper addresses this challenge with an end-to-end deep
learning (DL) framework with low inference complexity that leverages the
structure of the optimal SLP solution in the closed-form and its inherent
tensor equivariance (TE), where TE denotes that a permutation of the input
induces the corresponding permutation of the output. Building upon the
computationally efficient model-based formulations, as well as their known
closed-form solutions, we analyze their relationship with linear precoding (LP)
and investigate the corresponding optimality condition. We then construct a
mapping from the problem formulation to the solution and prove its TE, based on
which the designed networks reveal a specific parameter-sharing pattern that
delivers low computational complexity and strong generalization. Leveraging
these, we propose the backbone of the framework with an attention-based TE
module, achieving linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that such a framework is also applicable to imperfect CSI scenarios, where we
design a TE-based network to map the CSI, statistics, and symbols to auxiliary
variables. Simulation results show that the proposed framework captures
substantial performance gains of optimal SLP, while achieving an approximately
80-times speedup over conventional methods and maintaining strong
generalization across user numbers and symbol block lengths.

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative
to costly DFT simulations.

Conclusion: 这是首个解决RL振动控制训练安全挑战并提供验证解决方案的研究，提出的混合框架在保持无模型特性的同时确保了训练安全性。

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，选择性采样在高温设置下也能提升质量-多样性的权衡。

Conclusion: 选择性采样方法有效解决了高温采样在精度敏感任务中的问题，实现了更好的多样性和准确性平衡。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

TL;DR: 提出Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning (Weighted BC)，一种使用小规模干净参考集通过二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比的鲁棒模仿学习方法，在数据污染情况下仍能保持接近最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习数据集常受到对抗性投毒、系统错误或低质量样本的污染，导致标准行为克隆和离线RL方法性能下降。需要开发对数据污染具有鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 使用小规模已验证的干净参考集，通过二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比，将这些比率裁剪后作为BC目标中的权重，优先考虑干净专家行为，同时降低或丢弃污染数据权重。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，即使在高污染比例下，Weighted BC仍能保持接近最优性能，优于传统BC、BCQ和BRAC等基线方法。

Conclusion: Weighted BC提供了一种有效的鲁棒模仿学习方法，无需了解污染机制，具有理论保证，能在数据污染情况下实现接近干净专家策略的性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed
datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online
exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by
adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to
degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL
methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning
(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified
clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary
discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective
to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding
corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We
establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy
with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A
comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various
poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous
control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains
near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming
baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and
behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

TL;DR: RSAVQ是一个用于大型语言模型极低比特量化的新型向量量化框架，通过几何驱动创新解决方向误差和比特分配问题，在2-4比特量化中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型参数指数增长给资源受限设备部署带来挑战，现有向量量化方法存在无约束方向误差和次优比特分配两大关键问题。

Method: 提出RSAVQ框架，包含两个几何驱动创新：1）误差方向敏感度引导（EDSG），利用Fisher信息矩阵诱导的黎曼度量将量化误差投影到参数空间低敏感度方向；2）权重通道敏感度引导（WCSG），通过FIM曲率分析构建通道级敏感度度量来动态指导比特资源分配。

Conclusion: 该工作为受限环境提供了实用解决方案，并在信息几何与神经网络量化之间建立了理论桥梁，推动了高效深度学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信任感知深度Q网络的联邦学习防御方法，通过多信号证据集成和序列决策来抵御投毒和后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在部分可观测性下容易受到投毒和后门攻击，需要设计有效的防御机制。

Method: 将防御建模为部分可观测序列决策问题，使用信任感知深度Q网络集成多信号证据，优化长期鲁棒性-准确性目标。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上验证：准确性稳步提升；增加客户端重叠持续改善准确性并降低攻击成功率；减少可观测性时准确性稳定但攻击成功率上升；DQN实现最佳鲁棒性-准确性权衡。

Conclusion: 序列信念更新能够缓解弱信号影响，深度Q网络在联邦学习防御中表现出最优的鲁棒性-准确性平衡。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的列车延误预测对铁路运营效率至关重要，现有方法多关注单个列车延误预测，需要支持更高级别交通管理的车站级延误预测方法。

Method: 设计铁路中心化时空图卷积网络(RSTGCN)，集成列车频率感知空间注意力机制和新特征，预测特定时间段内所有进站列车的平均到达延误。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway
operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier
approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

*Yaron Meirovitch,Fuming Yang,Jeff Lichtman,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Budgeted Broadcast (BB)剪枝方法，通过给每个单元分配本地流量预算（活动率与扇出的乘积），在全局流量预算约束下最大化编码熵，实现选择性-受众平衡的剪枝策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法基于损失影响（如幅度或梯度）来移除参数，本文旨在通过最大化编码熵来学习更多样化和高效的表示。

Method: BB为每个单元分配本地流量预算，通过约束熵分析推导出选择性-受众平衡公式，并使用简单的本地执行器进行扇入或扇出剪枝。

Result: 在ASR Transformer、人脸识别ResNet和突触预测3D U-Net上，BB提高了编码熵和去相关性，在相同稀疏度下提升了准确率，有时甚至超过密集基线。在电子显微镜图像上获得了最先进的F1和PR-AUC。

Conclusion: BB易于集成，为学习更多样化和高效的表示提供了一条路径。

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these
collaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for
real-world applications such as pursuit-evasion, security, and competitive
manipulation. In this work, we extend the IsaacLab framework to support
scalable training of adversarial policies in high-fidelity physics simulations.
We introduce a suite of adversarial MARL environments featuring heterogeneous
agents with asymmetric goals and capabilities. Our platform integrates a
competitive variant of Heterogeneous Agent Reinforcement Learning with Proximal
Policy Optimization (HAPPO), enabling efficient training and evaluation under
adversarial dynamics. Experiments across several benchmark scenarios
demonstrate the framework's ability to model and train robust policies for
morphologically diverse multi-agent competition while maintaining high
throughput and simulation realism. Code and benchmarks are available at:

TL;DR: RLP是一种信息驱动的强化预训练目标，将强化学习的探索精神引入预训练最后阶段，通过奖励思维链提供的信息增益来训练模型独立思考，在数学和科学推理任务上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的大模型训练范式在预训练阶段仅使用下一个词预测损失，而强化学习只在最后的微调阶段引入。作者质疑这是否是最优的训练方式，希望将强化学习的核心精神——探索——更早地引入训练过程。

Method: 提出RLP目标，将思维链视为探索性动作，奖励基于思维链为预测未来词提供的信息增益。具体来说，奖励信号衡量在同时考虑上下文和采样推理链时下一个词对数似然的增加量。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B-Base上预训练RLP，在8个数学和科学基准测试中平均提升19%。在Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2上应用RLP，整体平均从42.81%提升到61.32%，科学推理任务提升23%。

Conclusion: RLP成功将强化学习重新构建为普通文本上的预训练目标，弥合了下一个词预测与有用思维链推理出现之间的差距，证明了在不同架构和模型规模上的可扩展性。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅加深了对RNN复杂机制的理解，还为设计更鲁棒和可解释的神经网络提供了有价值的工具，显著促进了可解释人工智能的发展。

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了两层神经网络训练损失梯度中的低秩结构，放宽了训练数据和参数的各向同性假设。在尖峰数据模型中，发现输入权重梯度近似低秩，由两个秩一成分主导：一个与批量数据残差对齐，另一个与输入数据中的秩一尖峰对齐。


<details>

Motivation: 传统分析通常假设训练数据和参数是各向同性的，本文旨在放宽这些假设，研究在更一般的数据分布下神经网络梯度的结构特性。

Method: 采用尖峰数据模型，允许批量数据各向异性和病态，不要求数据和权重矩阵独立，同时分析均值场和神经正切核两种缩放机制。

Result: 发现梯度主要由两个秩一成分主导，其平衡受训练数据特性、缩放机制和激活函数影响。标准正则化器（如权重衰减、输入噪声和雅可比惩罚）能选择性地调节这些成分。

Conclusion: 理论预测在合成和真实数据实验中得到验证，揭示了神经网络梯度在一般数据分布下的低秩结构特性及其与正则化的相互作用。

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian
penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic
and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

TL;DR: 提出NcPU框架，通过非对比学习解决PU学习中表示学习困难的问题，无需辅助信息即可在复杂数据集上显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PU学习方法在复杂数据集上表现远逊于监督学习（如CIFAR-100上差距达14.26%），主要瓶颈是在不可靠监督下难以学习判别性表示

Method: 结合噪声对鲁棒的非对比监督损失(NoiSNCL)和幻影标签消歧(PLD)方案，前者在不可靠监督下对齐类内表示，后者通过基于遗憾的标签更新提供保守负监督

Result: NoiSNCL使简单PU方法达到竞争性能；NcPU在多种数据集上显著优于现有最优PU方法，包括灾后建筑损毁映射等实际应用

Conclusion: NcPU框架通过非对比学习和标签消歧的协同作用，有效解决了PU学习中的表示学习瓶颈，在复杂数据集上实现了显著性能提升

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

Abstract: We study the identifiability of latent action policy learning (LAPO), a
framework introduced recently to discover representations of actions from video

statistical benefits and potential sources of unidentifiability. Finally, we
prove that an entropy-regularized LAPO objective identifies action
representations satisfying our desiderata, under suitable conditions. Our
analysis provides an explanation for why discrete action representations
perform well in practice.

TL;DR: 受微眼动启发，提出了一种轻量级位置编码扰动方法，无需微调即可检测LLM在事实性、安全性、毒性等方面的错误行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类视觉感知中的微眼动现象获得灵感，微眼动能揭示隐藏的感知动态，类似地希望通过轻量级扰动来揭示LLM的潜在错误信号。

Method: 使用轻量级位置编码扰动作为探测手段，无需微调或任务特定监督，通过扰动来引发指示模型错误行为的潜在信号。

Result: 在多个先进LLM上的实验表明，这种基于扰动的方法能有效检测各种错误行为，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 预训练的LLM已经编码了标记自身错误的内部证据，微眼动启发的干预为检测和缓解不良行为提供了途径。

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种量化数据集各向异性（对称性破缺）的度量方法，通过双样本神经分类器测试来区分原始数据集与其随机增强版本，揭示了基准点云数据集中存在的高度对齐现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称感知方法（如数据增强和等变架构）假设变换后的数据点在测试分布中具有高概率或"重要性"，但缺乏评估这一假设的方法。

Method: 开发了一种度量数据集各向异性的方法，使用双样本神经分类器测试来区分原始数据集和其随机增强等价物。

Result: 在合成数据集上验证了该度量，并在多个基准点云数据集中发现了出乎意料的高度对齐；理论分析表明分布对称性破缺会阻碍不变方法的最优性能。

Conclusion: 等变方法的有效性依赖于数据集，理解等变性需要重新思考数据中的对称性偏置。

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型的长输出上下文生成虽然支持扩展思维链，但也导致KV缓存快速增长，迅速耗尽GPU内存。

Method: 基于注意力稀疏性揭示思维链中不同重要性思维类型的观察，采用混合量化-驱逐策略，根据思维重要性分配token精度，并逐步驱逐不太重要的思维token。设计了扩展PagedAttention的内核，实现被驱逐token内存槽的高效重用，消除压缩开销。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，ThinKV使用不到原始KV缓存5%的大小实现了接近无损的精度，推理吞吐量比最先进基线提高了5.8倍。

Conclusion: ThinKV有效解决了大型推理模型KV缓存内存占用问题，在保持精度的同时显著提升性能。

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 获得了对抗风险的更紧下界，特别是在交叉熵损失函数下。数值实验验证了理论结果的有效性，表明所提方法能够提供比现有方法更精确的风险估计。

Conclusion: 本文成功将对抗鲁棒性理论扩展到任意损失函数，揭示了对抗鲁棒性与优化理论中经典问题的深刻联系，为设计超越0-1损失设置的鲁棒分类器提供了新的理论工具和计算框架。

Abstract: We consider adversarially robust classification in a multiclass setting under
arbitrary loss functions and derive dual and barycentric reformulations of the
corresponding learner-agnostic robust risk minimization problem. We provide
explicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss,
loss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way
available results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient
computation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the
design of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers
interesting connections between adversarial robustness, $\alpha$-fair packing
problems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures
where Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our
theoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments
where we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the
cross-entropy loss function.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

Method: 采用异构混合流模型，分两阶段训练：1）顺序专家训练单个流；2）基于似然的自适应全局权重估计。

Result: 在六个典型后验分布家族上，AMF-VI始终获得比单一流基线更低的负对数似然，并在Wasserstein-2和最大均值差异指标上表现稳定提升。

Conclusion: 自适应混合多样流模型为跨不同后验分布家族的稳健变分推断提供了可靠途径，同时保留了每个专家的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Normalising-flow variational inference (VI) can approximate complex
posteriors, yet single-flow models often behave inconsistently across
qualitatively different distributions. We propose Adaptive Mixture Flow
Variational Inference (AMF-VI), a heterogeneous mixture of complementary flows
(MAF, RealNVP, RBIG) trained in two stages: (i) sequential expert training of
individual flows, and (ii) adaptive global weight estimation via
likelihood-driven updates, without per-sample gating or architectural changes.
Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons,
rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower
negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable
gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD),
indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is
efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to
standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse
flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families
whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.

Abstract: Deep learning-based 3-dimensional (3D) shape reconstruction from
2-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly
important in medical disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and computational
modeling. This review surveys the methodological landscape of 3D MRI
reconstruction, focusing on 4 primary approaches: point cloud, mesh-based,
shape-aware, and volumetric models. For each category, we analyze the current
state-of-the-art techniques, their methodological foundation, limitations, and
applications across anatomical structures. We provide an extensive overview
ranging from cardiac to neurological to lung imaging. We also focus on the
clinical applicability of models to diseased anatomy, and the influence of
their training and testing data. We examine publicly available datasets,
computational demands, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the
emerging research directions including multimodal integration and
cross-modality frameworks. This review aims to provide researchers with a
structured overview of current 3D reconstruction methodologies to identify
opportunities for advancing deep learning towards more robust, generalizable,
and clinically impactful solutions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型虽然能从PPG信号中提取丰富生理信息，但依赖难以解释的特征，存在预测能力、临床可解释性和传感器设计之间的冲突。

Method: 提出PPGen生物物理模型和混合摊销推理（HAI）方法，将PPG信号与可解释的生理参数关联，并校正模型误设。

Result: 在广泛的模拟实验中，HAI能够在不同噪声和传感器条件下准确推断生理参数。

Conclusion: PPGen提供了一条路径，使PPG模型既能保持深度学习特征所需的保真度，又能支持临床解释和硬件设计。

Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as
heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via
photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer
physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate.
However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning,
creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and
sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model
that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters.
Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast,
robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG
signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico
experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters
under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward
PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while
supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.

TL;DR: 使用强化学习来对抗动态反应式干扰，通过Q-learning和DQN自适应调整传输功率、调制方式和信道选择，在未知信道条件和干扰策略的情况下维持高吞吐率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何应对采用动态策略选择信道和感知阈值的反应式干扰器，这种干扰器能够检测并干扰正在进行的传输，传统静态防御方法难以应对。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）方法，使用Q-learning处理离散干扰事件状态，使用深度Q网络（DQN）处理基于接收功率的连续状态，通过不同的奖励函数和动作集来优化传输策略。

Result: 结果显示强化学习能够快速适应频谱动态变化，在信道和干扰策略随时间变化的情况下仍能维持高传输速率。

Conclusion: 强化学习是应对动态反应式干扰的有效方法，能够在未知环境条件下自适应优化传输性能。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer
adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect
and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid
jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel
conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt
transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for
discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for
continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions
and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum
dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over
time.

*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个端到端框架，在空间融合和实体匹配任务中实现精确的召回率控制，通过神经网络排序器和多方法集成减少阈值方差，在数千万几何对中达到亚百分位方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模空间融合和实体匹配任务中，精确的召回率控制至关重要，因为遗漏少量真实匹配会破坏下游分析，而过度手动审查会增加成本。传统置信区间方法通常会超出目标几个百分点，且在偏态分数分布下存在高运行间方差。

Method: 使用等网格边界框过滤器和压缩稀疏行候选表示减少配对枚举；通过确定性xxHash引导样本训练轻量级神经网络排序器；构建可重现的分数十分位分层校准集；集成四种阈值估计方法并通过逆方差加权融合。

Result: 在两个真实地籍数据集（约631万和6734万配对）上评估，该方法始终在较小误差内达到召回目标，相比其他校准方法减少了冗余验证，并在单个TPU v3核心上端到端运行。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在大规模空间融合任务中实现了精确的召回率控制，显著减少了阈值方差和冗余验证，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

TL;DR: 提出了一个量子启发的内在维度估计基准QuIIEst，包含无限族拓扑非平凡流形，用于测试现有IDE方法在复杂流形上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内在维度估计方法在简单流形上表现良好，但在复杂流形上估计结果差异很大，需要更复杂的基准来评估这些方法。

Method: 基于量子光学方法构建无限族拓扑非平凡流形，允许曲率修改和加性噪声，并测试多种IDE方法在这些流形上的表现。

Result: 在QuIIEst流形上，IDE方法的准确性普遍低于现有基准，且随着曲率不均匀性增加性能下降很小，表明基准本身具有挑战性。

Conclusion: QuIIEst基准揭示了现有IDE方法在复杂流形上的局限性，为改进IDE方法提供了更真实的测试环境。

Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According
to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent
manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

*Alexander Ryabchenko,Wenlong Mou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are
stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world
applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically
Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a
specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored
Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the
action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a
sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP
assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an
induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose
off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps
and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered
settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde
O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the
feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode
non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical
foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while
demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation
constraints.

Method: 使用随机权重扰动(RWP)评估随机梯度，优化随机平滑目标函数，隐式捕捉曲率信息。

Result: 理论证明fSGLD的稳态分布集中在Hessian迹正则化的全局最小化器附近，实验显示在噪声标签和大规模视觉任务中取得优越泛化和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: fSGLD能高效寻找平坦最小值，计算成本仅为SAM的一半，同时提供理论保证和优越的泛化性能。

Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima
in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature
solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin
Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses
the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian
noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby
optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature
information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure
of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global
minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the
inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly
coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the
benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best
known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized
objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks,
in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD
achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline
algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of
SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to
significantly flatter minima.

Motivation: 自监督表示学习虽然取得了显著经验成功，但其基本原理仍不够清晰。现有工作往往将预测器网络、停止梯度操作等架构元素视为经验性添加，缺乏理论支撑。

Method: 从变分互信息下界出发，推导出SDMI和JMI两种训练范式。SDMI需要交替优化，理论上必须使用停止梯度操作；JMI允许通过对称架构进行联合优化。

Conclusion: 为现有自监督学习方法中不同架构组件的选择提供了理论解释，超越了启发式便利性，建立了从学习目标到优化策略和模型设计的理论联系。

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

Abstract: Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical
time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently,
diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable
success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches.
Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well
diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies
between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work
addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional
diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in
missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds
based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using
transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing
values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation
are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate
these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking
training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.

Abstract: Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast
trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation
models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality
and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict
independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint
predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic
correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which
can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach
to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing
multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based
approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than
autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by
mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is
key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted
properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related
to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive
models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often
suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new
problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some
limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In
this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a
generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently
learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We
benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and
non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.
Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and
tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the
spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited
datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency
establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive
complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling
real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

Abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all
layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art
optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing
that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and
in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training
method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of
layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of
progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier
performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise
smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and
stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive
training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further
reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific
relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms
full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster in
wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale
models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a
highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.

Conclusion: 选择性欠拟合是理解扩散模型的核心，为研究其泛化和生成性能提供了新的可测试见解。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative
modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score
function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a
basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle,
a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space
would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples.
Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit
the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we
refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting:
instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more
accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while
underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical
interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective
underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new,
testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete
diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements
without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous
Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework
for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond
unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and
principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited
for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion
posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields
sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs
samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked
diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized
expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and
anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear
and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further
demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and
text-guided editing.

TL;DR: PRISM是一种轻量级的、模型无关的方法，用于掩码扩散模型（MDMs）的推理时自校正，无需重新训练或架构修改即可检测和修正低质量token。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型需要自校正能力——在推理时检测和修正低质量token。虽然掩码扩散模型在离散空间生成建模中表现出色，但其自校正能力尚未被充分理解。现有方法要么需要重构MDM架构/训练，要么依赖不精确的token质量代理，限制了应用范围。

Method: PRISM通过定义自校正损失来学习每个token的质量分数，无需强化学习或验证器。这些质量分数与MDM在前向传播中同时计算，用于检测低质量token。

Result: PRISM在多个领域和规模上提升了MDM推理性能：数独游戏、无约束文本生成（1.7亿参数）以及代码生成（使用80亿参数的LLaDA）。

Conclusion: PRISM为掩码扩散模型提供了一种有效的推理时自校正方法，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and
revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)
have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete
spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior
attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling
MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality,
limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in
Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a
lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM.
Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns
per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are
computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality
tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales:
Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

TL;DR: 该研究通过理论和实证分析证实，扩散模型通过分数匹配中的平滑机制适应数据的低维流形结构，这种隐式正则化使模型能够沿数据流形进行泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解扩散模型强大泛化能力背后的机制，验证流形假说——即扩散模型成功的关键在于适应数据的低维几何结构。

Method: 通过研究经验分数匹配目标最小化器的平滑效果，分析隐式正则化作用，检验分数函数平滑（或对数密度域平滑）如何产生沿数据流形的切向平滑。

Result: 理论和实证结果证实，平滑分数函数会产生沿数据流形的切向平滑，并且通过选择适当的平滑可以控制扩散模型泛化所沿的流形。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的强大泛化能力源于其通过分数匹配中的平滑机制适应数据低维流形结构的能力，这种隐式正则化是模型成功的关键因素。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating
remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the
mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially
understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes
this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure
within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on
how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem
through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by
investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score
matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that
smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density
domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we
show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be
controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.

<details>

Motivation: LLM生成需要在输出质量和推理成本之间平衡，特别是在多代生成场景下，需要优化停止时机以降低计算开销。

Method: 将每次生成视为打开一个代价高昂的"盒子"，开发了UCB风格的Pandora's Box算法，并采用Bradley-Terry变换解决跨提示的奖励缩放问题。

Result: 在AlpacaFarm和HH-RLHF数据集上的实验表明，自适应策略能达到与Best-of-N采样相同的性能，但平均减少15-35%的生成次数。

Conclusion: 该研究在最优停止理论和推理时扩展之间建立了原则性桥梁，为LLM部署提供了理论性能保证和实际效率提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Result: 在MgCl2离子配对系统中，该方法对简单距离CV和复杂配位数CV都实现了高精度，且雅可比矩阵误差接近高斯分布。

Conclusion: 该框架使基于梯度的自由能方法能够整合复杂和机器学习的集体变量，拓宽了生物化学和材料模拟的应用范围。

Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that
restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural
network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates
and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical
forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for
both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,
Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them
suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy
methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of
biochemistry and materials simulations.

Conclusion: 基于低秩表示的压缩-重建框架能够有效解决神经压缩中的解码器瓶颈问题，实现高效计算和高保真图像重建。

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

TL;DR: SoftAdaClip是一种差分隐私训练方法，用平滑的tanh变换替代硬裁剪，在限制敏感性的同时保留梯度相对大小，显著减少子群体差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私（DP）虽然提供强隐私保护，但会降低模型性能和公平性，特别是对少数群体。DP-SGD中的梯度裁剪会不成比例地抑制少数子群体的学习信号

Method: 提出SoftAdaClip方法，用基于tanh的平滑变换替代硬裁剪，保持梯度相对大小同时限制敏感性，结合自适应机制

Result: 在MIMIC-III、GOSSIS-eICU和Adult Income等数据集上评估，相比DP-SGD减少子群体差异达87%，相比Adaptive-DPSGD减少48%，差异减少具有统计显著性

Conclusion: 将平滑变换与自适应机制结合对于实现公平和隐私保护的模型训练至关重要

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but
often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented
groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can
disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.
Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard
clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce
SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard
clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient
magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various
datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured
healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip
reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%
compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are
statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of
integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and
private model training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Softmax Attention的高效替代方案已被广泛研究，但基于理论洞察的更具表达力的机制（即使计算成本更高）相对较少被探索

Method: 从非参数统计角度提出Local Linear Attention机制，通过偏差-方差权衡分析证明其理论优势，开发FlashLLA硬件高效算法和定制推理内核来解决计算挑战

Result: LLA在测试时回归、上下文回归、关联回忆和状态跟踪任务中有效适应非平稳性，在测试时训练和上下文学习中优于强基线，展现出在大规模模型中的可扩展性和适用性

Conclusion: LLA为注意力机制提供了新的理论视角和实用实现，在保持表达力的同时通过高效算法解决了计算瓶颈

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely
studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical
insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored.
In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a
novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the
lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical
advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a
bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges
and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and
$\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient,
blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern
accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference
kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically
validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression,
in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment
results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity,
outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning,
and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in
large-scale models. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决扩散模型中OOD检测计算成本高的问题，提供一种快速且通用的检测方法。

Method: 结合雅可比矩阵迹和得分函数平方范数形成单一测试统计量，使用核密度估计估计分布内密度，仅需一次前向传播和一次雅可比向量积。

Conclusion: SCOPED为现实世界领域提供了实用、快速且可靠的OOD检测基础，适用于视觉感知异常、自回归模型异常检测、强化学习探索和无监督训练数据集筛选。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of
machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and
beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator
for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for
diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model
by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most
diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest
ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a
diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the
model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding
on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores
using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that,
in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one
Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator.
On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art
precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method
generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces,
identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes.
These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable
OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision,
outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement
learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.

Method: 识别MBPO失败的两个耦合问题：动态模型与奖励模型的尺度不匹配导致评论家低估，以及目标表示选择不当增加模型方差。通过解决这些问题来改进MBPO性能。

Abstract: Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based
reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it
helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting
failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We
focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and
critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of
strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work
shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites
involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to
sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing
in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This
reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into
algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues
behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that
induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy
coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model
variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes
enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to
outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance
previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental
average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop
taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic
failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how
benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms
generalize.

Conclusion: 该研究为开发符合人类偏好的AI系统提供了重要见解，特别是在处理噪声反馈时的偏好优化策略。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these
models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization,
which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred
responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning
LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is
unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.
This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,
providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we
consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise,
such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume
convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering
new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how
generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise
rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our
analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference
optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on
contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering
valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个基于离线数据集和预训练策略相对性能的原则性框架，用于指导离线到在线强化学习中的设计选择。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical
paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online
interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly
inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one
setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity
principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge
of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is
better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies
three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability
properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study,
finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases.
This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in
offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset
and the pretrained policy.

Conclusion: 基于LLM的代理模型结合LoRA-VBLL框架，为高维黑盒优化问题提供了有效且计算高效的解决方案。

Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems
with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well
as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box
optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a
theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model
so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto
choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla
BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping
with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g.,
categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates
have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the
LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input
variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we
leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters
together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational
Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only
computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits
recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well
as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has
been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model
weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed
(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the
real-world molecular optimization tasks.

Method: 1) 复杂度驱动的分区引擎按复杂度划分搜索空间；2) LLM驱动的架构提示协同进化算子，通过知识库更新和引导进化算法改进设计和提示；3) 零成本预测器避免从头训练大量候选架构。

Result: 在HW-NAS-Bench上，PEL-NAS相比基线获得更高的HV、更低的IGD，在相似精度下延迟降低达54%，搜索成本从数天降至数分钟。

Conclusion: PEL-NAS通过分区搜索空间和协同进化策略有效解决了LLM驱动的NAS探索偏差问题，实现了高效、低延迟的神经架构搜索。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint
optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional
supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language
Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide
quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes
neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover
architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To
address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned,
architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search
that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with
reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a
complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by
complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an
LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first
updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the
previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures
with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve
together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3)
a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from
scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve
overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at
similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes
compared with traditional supernet baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了对抗性攻击可转移性的关键区分：数据空间攻击可以转移，而表示空间攻击不能转移（除非表示几何对齐）。通过理论和实验在四个场景中验证了这一假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为何图像对抗样本和文本越狱攻击能在模型间转移，而视觉语言模型的图像越狱攻击却无法转移的差异现象。

Method: 在四个不同场景中进行验证：1) 数学证明相同输入输出映射但不同表示的网络；2) 构建图像分类器的表示空间攻击；3) 构建语言模型的表示空间攻击；4) 构建视觉语言模型的数据空间和表示空间攻击。

Result: 数据空间攻击成功转移，表示空间攻击无法转移（除非表示几何对齐）。表示空间攻击对目标模型有效但无法跨模型转移。

Conclusion: 对抗性转移并非所有攻击的固有属性，而是取决于其操作域——共享数据空间与模型独特表示空间，这对构建更鲁棒模型具有重要启示。

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial
examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text
jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a
pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image
jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking
difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability
of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can
transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not
without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and
empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we
mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks
compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we
construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as
successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we
construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak
the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space
attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that
representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries
are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that
adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent
on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique
representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准多数投票方法平等对待所有答案，无法考虑模型间的潜在异质性和相关性，在多智能体LLM推理中需要更有效的答案聚合方法。

Method: 设计了两种新算法：最优权重(OW)和逆惊喜流行度(ISP)，利用一阶和二阶信息进行答案聚合。

Result: 在合成数据集、LLM微调基准测试(UltraFeedback、MMLU)和真实医疗场景(ARMMAN)中，新方法始终优于多数投票。

Conclusion: OW和ISP方法不仅提供实际性能提升，还为设计稳健的多智能体LLM流水线提供了概念性见解。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning,
how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a
fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally,
failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this
work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and
Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and
second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably
mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions,
leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our
algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as
UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all
cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both
practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust
multi-agent LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable
dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for
learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor
administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For
realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete,
continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline
conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to
capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis
of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations
reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate
clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and
MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned
behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of
over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established
clinical protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱基础模型(KGFMs)的确定性等变性限制了其表达能力，无法区分结构相似但语义不同的关系，需要突破这一限制。

Method: 引入概率节点关系等变性，通过迭代采样随机游走、编码序列、序列模型嵌入和学习池化来聚合节点和关系表示。

Result: Flock在诊断数据集Petals上完美解决问题，在54个知识图谱的实体和关系预测任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 概率节点关系等变性是提升知识图谱基础模型表达能力的关键，Flock模型证明了这一方法的有效性。

Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs),
which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations.
Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing
equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties
of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with
similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of
deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of
KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but
semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in
distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries
during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that
iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording
protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of
nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock
perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail,
and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction
tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个预测框架，使用FDA兽医药物不良事件报告数据，通过机器学习模型预测动物用药后的死亡与恢复结果，结合数据预处理、特征工程和可解释AI技术，实现了高精度的安全结果预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保食品生产动物用药安全至关重要，不良事件可能预示着意外的药代动力学或毒代动力学效应，增加食品链中违规残留物的风险。需要开发预测框架来早期识别高风险药物事件特征。

Method: 使用FDA OpenFDA兽医医学中心的128万份报告数据，建立数据预处理管道，整合理化药物特性，评估多种监督学习模型（随机森林、CatBoost、XGBoost等），采用集成方法和类别不平衡处理技术，结合SHAP进行可解释性分析。

Conclusion: 结合严格的数据工程、先进机器学习和可解释AI，能够实现准确、可解释的兽医安全结果预测，支持FARAD使命，加强残留风险评估，为监管和临床决策提供信息。

Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect
animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal
unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of
violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive
framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million
reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized
AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,
and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were
integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,
including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language
models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as
undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal
outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,
achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average
Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved
minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.
Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,
including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug
physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal
outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data
engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,
interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports
FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,
strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical
decision-making.

TL;DR: CarbonX是一个基于时间序列基础模型的开源工具，用于碳强度预测和插补等脱碳任务，仅需历史碳强度数据即可在全球214个电网实现零样本预测，MAPE为15.82%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碳强度预测工具存在三个主要局限：需要电网特定电力结构数据、依赖单独的电网特定模型难以实现全球覆盖、缺乏不确定性估计限制了碳感知应用的可靠性。

Method: 利用时间序列基础模型的通用性，仅使用历史碳强度数据和单一通用模型，支持碳强度预测和插补等多种任务，可提供长达21天的预测。

Result: 在214个全球电网中实现15.82%的零样本预测MAPE；在13个基准电网中平均MAPE为9.59%，尾部预测MAPE为16.54%，同时提供95%覆盖率的预测区间；在插补任务上比统计基线提升1.2-3.9倍性能。

Conclusion: CarbonX可在数据有限的任何电网中轻松使用并提供强大性能，是适用于全球规模脱碳的实用工具。

Abstract: Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing
and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built
environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts,
yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific
electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable;
(ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to
provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty
estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.
  In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time
Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX
utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple
tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse
grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model,
our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX
performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average
MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing
prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to
21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned,
CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation
task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any
grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a
practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二值神经网络验证问题的自然整数规划公式存在大M约束导致的积分间隙问题，难以高效求解。

Method: 1. 为多类分类场景设计新的线性目标函数；2. 利用BNN的递归结构生成有效不等式来改进整数规划公式。

Result: 相比现有IP方法，新方法在有限时间内能够验证BNN对抗更大范围的输入扰动。

Conclusion: 提出的两种技术显著改善了二值神经网络验证问题的整数规划求解效率，扩展了可验证的扰动范围。

Abstract: Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary
weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for
classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small
perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and
the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem
over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an
integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often
challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$
constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we
introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class
setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities
for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find
that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input
perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.

TL;DR: 提出了Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL)框架，通过双向转换成功率作为奖励信号来训练模型提高一致性，显著提升了化学LLM的性能和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前化学大语言模型缺乏双向一致性，例如能成功描述分子但无法从其生成的文本准确重建原始结构，这表明模型学习的是单向记忆而非灵活掌握。

Method: 引入RTRL框架，使用双向转换成功作为奖励信号进行强化学习训练；提出迭代变体，前向和反向映射交替训练形成自我改进循环。

Result: 实验表明RTRL在监督、自监督和合成数据机制下显著提升了模型性能和一致性，优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 双向一致性不仅是理想属性，而且是可训练目标，为构建更稳健可靠的基础模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for
computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction
and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency.
For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a
molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from
its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning
unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work
has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency
and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes
consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce
Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model
to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation
as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and
reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a
process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive
amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that
RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong
baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This
work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a
trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable
foundation models.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，AI安全和对齐变得至关重要。提示防护作为一种轻量级机制被广泛采用，但其安全性存在隐患。

Method: 利用提示防护与主LLM之间的资源不对称性，编码一个轻量级防护无法解码但主模型能够理解的越狱提示。

Result: 该攻击方法成功越狱了Google Gemini、DeepSeek Chat、Grok和Mistral Le Chat等高度保护的聊天接口，同时保持响应质量。

Conclusion: 揭示了轻量级提示防护在现代LLM架构中的固有攻击面，强调需要将防御重点从阻止恶意输入转向防止恶意输出。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is
paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms
designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update.
In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards,
highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production
models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat
interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok
(3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry
between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that
lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack
surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and
underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to
preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment
issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and
malicious response leakage during thinking.

we demonstrate the efficacy of performing the channel estimation function in
the PUSCH receiver through a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in
Python. This is done in a digital twin first, and subsequently in a real-time
testbed. Our proposed methodology, realized in the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform,
lays the foundation for scalable integration of AI/ML models into

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse
as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face
thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon,
where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive
preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable
predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to
specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic
framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this
paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic
framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four
specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by
external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted
preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by
leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster
performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively
selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final
predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive,
transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and
comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a
white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks.
Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci
consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing
forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci
produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more
transparent and interpretable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM反事实推理能力的方法往往跳过溯因步骤，导致高估性能。需要开发能完整评估三个推理步骤（溯因、干预、预测）的框架。

Method: 提出可执行反事实框架，使用代码和数学问题操作化因果推理，要求完整执行三个推理步骤，并创建可扩展的合成数据。

Result: SOTA模型从干预推理到反事实推理准确率下降25-40%；监督微调在域内有效但域外泛化差；强化学习在代码和数学问题上均获得1.5-2倍提升。

Conclusion: 强化学习能诱导核心认知行为并泛化到新领域，是提升LLM反事实推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three
steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing
alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This
skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their
applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However,
existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend
to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning
and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce
executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal
reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all
three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data
creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and
improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy
(25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like
o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set
comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on
out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a
model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems.
While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves
in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD
tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning
induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding
gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math
problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and
highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPL方法通过从人类干预中学习隐式偏好信号，将单次干预引导到未来多个时间步，从而在危险区域提前修正智能体行为，提高学习效率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式模仿学习方法只修正当前状态的动作，不调整未来可能更危险状态的行为。需要一种方法将人类干预的影响传播到未来状态。

Method: 提出预测性偏好学习(PPL)，将每次人类干预引导到L个未来时间步（偏好视界），假设智能体执行相同动作且人类进行相同干预，通过偏好优化在预期探索的危险区域传播专家修正。

Result: 在自动驾驶和机器人操作基准测试中验证了方法的效率和通用性，显著提高了学习效率并减少了所需的人类演示。

Conclusion: 选择合适的偏好视界L可以在风险状态覆盖和标签正确性之间取得平衡，从而限制算法最优性差距。该方法有效提升了从人类干预中学习的效率。

Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to
monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation
learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,
they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more
hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from
Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals
contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The
key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time
steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent
follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the
preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,
expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the
agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and
reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments
on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate
its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that
selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states
with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap. Demo
and code are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/ppl

TL;DR: MIRA是一种无需训练、在推理时对齐扩散模型的方法，通过图像空间的KL约束来防止奖励黑客行为，在保持提示一致性的同时提升奖励分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成的图像虽然符合文本提示，但往往无法满足用户特定的标量奖励标准（如美学评分）。现有的推理时对齐方法存在奖励黑客问题，即模型生成高分数但偏离原始提示的图像。

Method: 提出MIRA方法，引入基于分数的KL代理在图像空间进行正则化，约束采样轨迹以防止奖励黑客。还提出了MIRA-DPO，将偏好优化映射到推理时间，适用于不可微分奖励。

Result: 在SDv1.5和SDXL模型、多种奖励函数和公开数据集上，MIRA相比基线方法获得超过60%的胜率，同时保持提示一致性。机制图显示奖励增益接近零漂移，而DNO方法随计算增加而漂移。

Conclusion: MIRA通过图像空间约束有效解决了推理时对齐中的奖励黑客问题，无需微调即可提升奖励分数并保持提示一致性，为扩散模型的对齐提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but
the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by
scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires
fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time
alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative,
modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards
generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward
hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate
significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization
is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit
image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward
hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an
image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory
with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can
increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable
approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple
rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g.,
Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while
preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero
drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO,
mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone,
extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了RLHF中KL散度正则化的不同实现方式，建立了统一框架证明'k1 in reward'和'k2 as loss'在策略条件下梯度等价，都是Reverse KL正则化的理论正确实现，而'k3 as loss'只是一阶有偏近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法中KL散度正则化的实现存在混淆，有些方法基于数值估计原则而非优化损失功能，需要建立统一框架来分析不同实现方式的等价性和理论正确性。

Method: 建立统一框架连接两种实现风格：将数学项kn作为策略得分函数的分离系数（'kn in reward'）或作为直接损失函数（'kn as loss'），证明后者总可以通过前者的等效梯度系数来分析。

Result: 证明'k1 in reward'是Reverse KL正则化的原则性损失；在策略条件下'k2 as loss'与'k1 in reward'梯度等价；'k3 as loss'只是一阶有偏近似；离策略实现因忽略重要性采样而有偏。

Conclusion: 为KL正则化的选择和正确实现提供了基于梯度的全面理论基础，有助于构建更稳健有效的RLHF系统。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent
overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided
by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the
term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we
establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct
implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached
coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct
loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show
that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient
in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove
that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss
for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under
on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact,
gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our
work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL
objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like
in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss.
Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss'
methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a
principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based
rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the
way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD)框架，利用干预数据进行因果发现，通过建模总因果效应矩阵并采用spike-and-slab horseshoe先验，实现不确定性感知的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在大规模任务上性能不佳且无法量化不确定性，而高通量基因组扰动筛选的发展为利用干预数据改进模型识别提供了机会。

Method: 采用经验贝叶斯框架，建模总因果效应矩阵的似然（近似矩阵正态分布），使用spike-and-slab horseshoe先验对边进行建模，并从观测数据中分别学习无标度和Erdős-Rényi结构的数据驱动权重。

Result: 通过广泛模拟显示，IBCD在结构恢复方面优于现有基线方法；应用于521个基因的CRISPR扰动数据，证明边后验包含概率能够识别稳健的图结构。

Conclusion: IBCD框架在因果发现中实现了优越的性能和不确定性量化能力，为大规模干预数据分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging
problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens
have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to
improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor
performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we
propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian
framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models
the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated
by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a
spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven
weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational
data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware
inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior
structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR
perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior
inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.

TL;DR: 提出了TetriServe系统，通过步级序列并行和基于轮次的调度机制，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升DiT模型的服务水平目标达成率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DiT服务系统使用固定程度的序列并行，对于混合分辨率和截止时间的异构工作负载效率低下，导致GPU利用率差和SLO达成率低

Method: 提出步级序列并行策略，动态调整单个请求的并行度；设计TetriServe系统，采用基于轮次的调度机制，包括时间离散化、步级并行度适配和联合请求打包

Result: 在先进的DiT模型上评估显示，TetriServe相比现有解决方案实现了高达32%的SLO达成率提升

Conclusion: TetriServe通过创新的调度和并行策略，有效解决了DiT模型在严格SLO约束下的服务效率问题

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images
through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level
Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost,
particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree
sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with
mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO
attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically
adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines.
We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for
highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel
round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing
time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2)
adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and
(3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation
on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher
SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.

TL;DR: 本文研究了强化学习（RL）与蛋白质语言模型（PLMs）的结合，发现在蛋白质设计中RL能显著提高成功率和采样效率，但效果取决于任务空间、奖励准确性和策略容量三个因素的相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强化学习是否能推动蛋白质语言模型超越其预训练先验，揭示潜在的序列-结构-功能规则，并比较RL与监督学习在蛋白质设计中的表现差异。

Method: 在四个蛋白质设计领域（抗菌肽设计、激酶变体优化、抗体工程和逆折叠）中，将多种RL算法与不同类别的PLMs配对使用，系统评估RL的采样效率和能力发现潜力。

Result: RL在所有基准测试中都能持续提升成功率和采样效率。性能提升遵循三因素交互作用：任务空间、奖励保真度和策略容量共同决定收益。当奖励准确且信息丰富、策略容量充足、任务有超越监督基线的空间时，改进会按比例扩展。

Conclusion: 为蛋白质设计中的RL提供了实用指导：在扩展策略规模前优先考虑奖励建模和校准，根据任务难度匹配算法和正则化强度，并将容量分配到边际收益最大的地方。

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have advanced computational protein science
through large-scale pretraining and scalable architectures. In parallel,
reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise
multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs
beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function
rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four
domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody
engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model
classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it
reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL
consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a
three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity
jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies
have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines,
improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains
saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in
protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling
policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty,
and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest. Implementation is
available at https://github.com/chq1155/RL-PLM.

TL;DR: SPAMP是一个统一的梯度整形框架，通过统计感知的逐层自适应调制和投影来替代传统的硬阈值梯度裁剪，提供更灵活和动态的梯度处理方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度裁剪使用固定的硬阈值，缺乏灵活性且忽略了梯度分布的动态特性，限制了训练稳定性和性能。

Method: SPAMP跟踪局部梯度统计信息，动态估计阈值，并应用基于幂的变换以可微分方式调制更新幅度，将裁剪和预热重新表述为控制有效更新尺度的双重机制。

Result: 在图像和语言任务上的广泛实验表明，SPAMP在稳定性、收敛性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPAMP提供了一个原则性的替代方案，能够更好地控制梯度更新尺度，提升深度学习训练的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is widely used to stabilize deep network training, but its
formulation as a hard, fixed threshold limits flexibility and ignores gradient
distribution dynamics. We propose SPAMP (Statistical Per-layer Adaptive
Modulation and Projection), a unified framework that generalizes clipping into
smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics,
dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to
modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts
clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update
scale $\eta_t \|g_t\|$, offering a principled alternative to rigid heuristics.
Extensive experiments across image and language tasks demonstrate that SPAMP
improves stability, convergence, and robustness over existing methods.

TL;DR: TRAAC是一种在线后训练强化学习方法，通过自适应压缩推理步骤来解决模型在复杂推理任务中的"欠适应"问题，平衡推理不足和过度推理，提高准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维模型在复杂推理任务中面临"欠适应"问题：推理不足会导致复杂问题错误，过度推理则会产生冗余步骤。需要根据任务难度自适应调整推理长度。

Method: 提出TRAAC方法，利用模型在长推理轨迹上的自注意力来识别重要步骤并剪枝冗余步骤，同时估计任务难度并将其纳入训练奖励，学习根据难度分配推理预算。

Result: 在多种任务上，TRAAC相比基础模型平均准确率提升8.4%，推理长度相对减少36.8%；相比最佳RL基线准确率提升7.9%，长度减少29.4%。在分布外非数学数据集上也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TRAAC通过任务难度校准和基于注意力的压缩，能够根据难度进行细粒度推理预算调整，在多样化任务上实现准确性和效率的提升。

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病远程监测中存在的三种噪声（患者测量不准确、环境噪声、数据传输丢失）导致UPDRS预测误差增加，需要开发噪声鲁棒的方法。

Method: 首先将语音特征按选定特征值分组构建对比对，然后训练多层感知机编码器生成噪声鲁棒特征，最后将原始特征与增强特征拼接用于UPDRS预测。

Result: 实验表明NoRo能有效提升不同下游预测模型在各种噪声环境下的UPDRS预测鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NoRo框架成功解决了PD远程监测中的噪声问题，为UPDRS预测提供了有效的噪声鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
disorder. PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling
self-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types
of noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement
inaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during
transmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these
challenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First,
the original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the
continuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs.
Second, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron
encoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are
concatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are
then fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a
novel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and
extensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise
robustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models
under different noisy environments.

Abstract: Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative
artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to
exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities
often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed
hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel
junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel,
FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true
random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with
minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative
adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to
18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline.
With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established
scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106
parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large
language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as
practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.

Conclusion: 后验坍塌是数据结构和变分约束相互作用产生的相变，为深度生成模型的可训练性和表示能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of posterior collapse in variational
autoencoders (VAEs) from the perspective of statistical physics, and reveal
that it constitutes a phase transition governed jointly by data structure and
model hyper-parameters. By analyzing the stability of the trivial solution
associated with posterior collapse, we identify a critical hyper-parameter
threshold. This critical boundary, separating meaningful latent inference from
collapse, is characterized by a discontinuity in the KL divergence between the
approximate posterior and the prior distribution. We validate this critical
behavior on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming the existence of
a phase transition. Our results demonstrate that posterior collapse is not
merely an optimization failure, but rather an emerging phase transition arising
from the interplay between data structure and variational constraints. This
perspective offers new insights into the trainability and representational
capacity of deep generative models.

TL;DR: 研究发现SFT分数高并不保证RL训练后性能提升，反而可能因数据简单或同质化导致RL效果更差。提出了泛化损失和Pass@large k作为更好的RL结果预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前两阶段训练范式（SFT+RL）的假设，即高SFT分数会带来更好的RL结果。通过大量实验发现这一假设不成立。

Method: 训练了数百个12B参数模型，使用SFT和GRPO RLVR，在7个数学基准测试上进行多达256次重复评估，消耗超过100万GPU小时。

Result: 基于泛化损失和Pass@large k的预测比直接使用SFT性能预测更准确，R²和Spearman相关系数提升高达0.5（2倍）。

Conclusion: SFT性能不是RL结果的可靠预测指标，建议使用泛化损失和Pass@large k来评估模型在RL训练前的潜力。

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

Conclusion: 合成数据在预训练中具有条件性优势，改写合成数据未显示模型崩溃迹象，而纯生成合成数据可能出现模型崩溃，为实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

### [96] [CAT: Curvature-Adaptive Transformers for Geometry-Aware Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01634)
*Ryan Y. Lin,Siddhartha Ojha,Nicholas Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出曲率自适应Transformer（CAT），通过轻量级门控机制动态学习每个token在三种几何注意力分支间的路由，实现自适应几何专业化，在知识图谱补全任务上相比固定几何方法获得约10%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer假设欧几里得几何，限制了在非欧几里得结构数据上的有效性。现有扩展到双曲和球面空间的方法需要预先确定单一几何，当数据具有混合几何特性时缺乏灵活性。

Method: CAT架构包含三个几何注意力分支（欧几里得、双曲、球面），通过可微分门控机制动态路由每个token到合适的几何分支，路由网络提供可解释的曲率偏好。

Result: 在FB15k-237和WN18RR知识图谱补全基准测试中，CAT相比固定几何基线在MRR和Hits@10指标上提升约10%，仅增加5%参数且推理时间相当。

Conclusion: 学习到的几何自适应优于任何单一固定几何，CAT为跨语言、视觉和多模态领域的混合几何架构提供了可扩展且可解释的基础。

Abstract: Transformers achieve strong performance across diverse domains but implicitly
assume Euclidean geometry in their attention mechanisms, limiting their
effectiveness on data with non-Euclidean structure. While recent extensions to
hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical
patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori,
reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We
introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that
dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches
through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry
approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to
the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The
routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch
employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On
knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves
approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines
with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These
results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single
fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable
and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across
language, vision, and multimodal domains.

*Liyan Xie,Muhammad Siddeek,Mohamed Seif,Andrea J. Goldsmith,Mengdi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于组合模式的水印框架，用于检测和定位水印LLM输出中的后生成编辑


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，LLM生成的内容可能经过后生成编辑（如人工修订或欺骗攻击），因此需要检测和定位这些修改

Method: 使用组合模式水印框架，将词汇表划分为不相交子集，在生成过程中通过强制确定性的组合模式嵌入水印，并设计轻量级局部统计量来标记和定位编辑

Result: 在开源LLM上对各种编辑场景进行评估，展示了在编辑定位方面强大的实证性能

Conclusion: 提出的组合水印框架能有效检测和定位水印LLM输出中的后生成编辑

Abstract: Watermarking has become a key technique for proprietary language models,
enabling the distinction between AI-generated and human-written text. However,
in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation
edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to
detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task:
detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To
this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework,
which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark
by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during
generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic
that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight
local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two
task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and
evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios,
demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于支持基分解的新框架，用于在无界输入情况下实现高效的注意力近似，突破了现有方法对输入有界性的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有子二次注意力近似算法需要输入有界的限制条件，这在现代大语言模型中很少成立，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 利用查询和键矩阵的次高斯特性，将大值和小值分开处理：稀疏部分精确计算，稠密部分使用多项式近似，并扩展到多阈值设置消除分布假设。

Result: 证明了子二次时间复杂度，并为多项式注意力的经验成功提供了首个理论依据，表明softmax注意力可以通过多个带草图的多项式注意力组合来近似。

Conclusion: 支持基分解框架突破了注意力计算的理论限制，为高效的大语言模型扩展提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of softmax attention remains a central bottleneck in
scaling large language models (LLMs). [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] proposed a
sub-quadratic attention approximation algorithm, but it works only under the
restrictive bounded-entry assumption. Since this assumption rarely holds in
practice, its applicability to modern LLMs is limited.
  In this paper, we introduce support-basis decomposition, a new framework for
efficient attention approximation beyond bounded entries. We empirically
demonstrate that the entries of the query and key matrices exhibit sub-Gaussian
behavior. Our approach uses this property to split large and small entries,
enabling exact computation on sparse components and polynomial approximation on
dense components. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving a
sub-quadratic runtime, and extend the method to a multi-threshold setting that
eliminates all distributional assumptions. Furthermore, we provide the first
theoretical justification for the empirical success of polynomial attention
[Kacham, Mirrokni, and Zhong, ICML 2024], showing that softmax attention can be
closely approximated by a combination of multiple polynomial attentions with
sketching.

TL;DR: 提出REFEREE方法解决无源跨域持续学习问题，禁止使用源域样本，结合源预训练模型和视觉语言模型，通过频率感知提示和不确定性加权策略处理域偏移和噪声伪标签，使用KLDA防止灾难性遗忘。


<details>

Motivation: 现有跨域持续学习方法需要完全标记的源域，这在隐私受限环境中不可行。本文研究无源跨域持续学习问题，完全禁止使用源域样本。

Method: REFEREE方法结合源预训练模型和视觉语言模型，采用频率感知提示技术鼓励低频分量、抑制高频分量生成增强样本，使用不确定性加权策略处理噪声伪标签，通过核线性判别分析防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 严格的数值研究证实该方法优势明显，显著超越需要访问源域样本的现有方法。

Conclusion: REFEREE方法成功解决了无源跨域持续学习问题，在禁止使用源域样本的情况下仍能取得优异性能。

Abstract: Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully
address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully
labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained
environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free
cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are
completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware
dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled
source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is
built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale
vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal
generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain
shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a
frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while
suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware
augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label
problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy
where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,
thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the
issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant
analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification
is performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the
random kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of
our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples
with significant margins.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Elsa的神经网络剪枝方法，通过约束优化技术实现高达90%的极端稀疏度，同时保持模型精度，在LLaMA-2-7B等大语言模型上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络剪枝方法在达到中等稀疏度（50-60%）后难以进一步提升，会严重损害模型精度，这阻碍了大语言模型在计算和内存效率方面的进一步优化。

Method: Elsa方法通过识别当前实践中依赖代理目标公式的局限性，采用基于ADMM的标准约束优化技术直接有效地解决这一问题。

Result: Elsa在多种模型和规模上实现了显著改进，在LLaMA-2-7B模型90%稀疏度下，困惑度比现有最佳方法低7.8倍。还开发了量化变体Elsa-L，可扩展到极大模型（27B）。

Conclusion: 该方法在推进LLM稀疏化前沿方面取得了有意义的进展，表明在迄今探索有限的方向上仍存在显著的进一步改进机会。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a promising technique to mitigate the excessive
computational and memory requirements of large language models (LLMs). Despite
its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional
methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%)
without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current
impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\texttt{Elsa}$,
which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model
fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice,
all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective
formulation. $\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via
standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on
ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show
that $\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods;
e.g., it achieves 7.8$\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on
LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present
$\texttt{Elsa}_{\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large
models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees. These
results highlight meaningful progress in advancing the frontier of LLM
sparsity, while promising that significant opportunities for further
advancement may remain in directions that have so far attracted limited
exploration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AsyPPO是一种针对大语言模型RL训练的高效框架，通过使用轻量级mini-critics集合来恢复critic的作用，解决了传统价值函数在大模型规模下计算成本高且稀疏奖励下失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL4LLM方法避免使用显式critics，主要因为传统价值函数在大模型规模下计算成本高，且在稀疏奖励和长推理视野下容易失效。作者希望从架构角度重新审视这一瓶颈。

Method: AsyPPO采用一组轻量级mini-critics，每个critic在不相交的prompt分片上训练，鼓励多样性同时保持校准。利用critic间的不确定性来优化策略更新：在critics一致的状态中屏蔽优势值，从熵正则化中过滤高分歧状态。

Result: 在仅使用5,000个样本的开源数据上训练后，AsyPPO在多个基准测试中持续提升学习稳定性和性能，相比GRPO等强基线，在Qwen3-4b-Base上性能提升超过6%，在Qwen3-8b-Base和Qwen3-14b-Base上提升约3%。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了架构创新对于可扩展、高效算法的重要性，AsyPPO成功恢复了critic的作用同时保持了大模型设置下的效率。

Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing
them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic:
conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM
scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We
revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce
Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable
framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in
large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each
trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while
preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust
estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy
update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add
little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy
regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source
data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability
and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,
achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about
three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without
additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural
innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

TL;DR: TimeHUT是一种通过层次化均匀性-容忍度平衡来学习时间序列表示的新方法，使用对比表示和温度调度器来优化嵌入空间特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在学习强时间序列表示，在嵌入空间中实现均匀性和容忍度的有效平衡，以更好地捕捉时间依赖关系。

Method: 使用层次化设置学习实例级和时间信息；集成温度调度器到对比损失中；应用层次化角度边界损失来增强正负样本对的分离。

Result: 在128个UCR和30个UAE数据集上的分类任务中显著优于现有方法，在异常检测任务中获得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: TimeHUT通过层次化均匀性-容忍度平衡有效提升了时间序列表示学习性能，在分类任务中表现突出。

Abstract: We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations
by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations.
Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the
aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the
embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both
instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we
integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to
balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings.
Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and
temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and
negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of
positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture
of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach
on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and
multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly
detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by
considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for
anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are
performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.

TL;DR: 提出ShapKAN剪枝框架，使用Shapley值评估KAN节点重要性，解决传统基于幅度的剪枝方法对输入坐标偏移敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KAN网络虽然能恢复符号表示，但其架构对传统剪枝方法构成挑战，基于幅度的剪枝方法因对输入坐标偏移敏感而不可靠。

Method: 使用Shapley值归因来评估节点重要性，以平移不变的方式量化每个节点的实际贡献。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，ShapKAN能保持真实节点重要性，同时实现有效的网络压缩。

Conclusion: ShapKAN提升了KAN的可解释性优势，便于在资源受限环境中部署。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, understanding feature-outcome relationships
is as crucial as achieving high predictive accuracy. While traditional neural
networks excel at prediction, their black-box nature obscures underlying
functional relationships. Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) address this by
employing learnable spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling
recovery of symbolic representations while maintaining competitive performance.
However, KAN's architecture presents unique challenges for network pruning.
Conventional magnitude-based methods become unreliable due to sensitivity to
input coordinate shifts. We propose \textbf{ShapKAN}, a pruning framework using
Shapley value attribution to assess node importance in a shift-invariant
manner. Unlike magnitude-based approaches, ShapKAN quantifies each node's
actual contribution, ensuring consistent importance rankings regardless of
input parameterization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that ShapKAN preserves true node importance while enabling
effective network compression. Our approach improves KAN's interpretability
advantages, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态融合方法未能充分考虑模态质量变化（如噪声、缺失或语义冲突），导致在识别细微情感时性能不佳。

Method: 采用双门融合机制，基于信息熵和模态重要性自适应调整特征权重，减少噪声模态影响并优先考虑信息丰富的线索。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上的实验表明，AGFN在准确率上显著优于强基线方法，能有效识别细微情感且具有鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: AGFN通过学习更广泛的特征分布增强泛化能力，减少特征位置与预测误差之间的相关性，从而创建更鲁棒的多模态特征表示。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse
modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction.
However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in
modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically
conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce
a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion
\textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion
mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism
mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues
following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on
CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong
baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust
performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates
that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature
distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and
prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and
creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

Motivation: 在离线数据驱动的分类优化问题中，由于组合性质导致数据覆盖不足，传统方法难以设计出具有理论保证的有效解决方案。

Method: 引入悲观分类优化（PASTA）框架，利用悲观原则，仅要求离线数据分布包含最优分类，而不需要覆盖所有可行分类。

Conclusion: PASTA框架为离线数据驱动的分类优化问题提供了有效的解决方案，能够在数据覆盖不足的情况下实现最优性能。

Abstract: We study a broad class of assortment optimization problems in an offline and
data-driven setting. In such problems, a firm lacks prior knowledge of the
underlying choice model, and aims to determine an optimal assortment based on
historical customer choice data. The combinatorial nature of assortment
optimization often results in insufficient data coverage, posing a significant
challenge in designing provably effective solutions. To address this, we
introduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that
leverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under
general choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data
distribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full
coverage of all feasible assortments. Theoretically, we establish the first
finite-sample regret bounds for offline assortment optimization across several
widely used choice models, including the multinomial logit and nested logit
models. Additionally, we derive a minimax regret lower bound, proving that
PASTA is minimax optimal in terms of sample and model complexity. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline
approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了分层最优传输（HOT）框架，用于神经网络表示对齐，解决了传统方法的不对称性、缺乏全局对齐分数和深度不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示相似性方法存在三个主要问题：独立对齐每层导致不对称结果、缺乏全局对齐分数、难以处理不同深度的网络。这些问题源于忽略了全局激活结构和限制了一对一的层对应关系。

Method: HOT框架联合推断软性的、全局一致的层到层耦合和神经元级传输计划，允许源神经元在多个目标层之间分布质量，在边际约束下最小化总传输成本。

Result: 在视觉模型、大语言模型和人类视觉皮层记录上的评估显示，HOT在对齐质量上匹配或超越标准成对匹配方法，并揭示了平滑、细粒度的分层对应关系。

Conclusion: HOT能够实现更丰富、更可解释的表示比较，特别是在网络架构或深度不同的情况下，通过全局优化自然产生结构化模式，而贪婪的逐层方法则缺乏这些模式。

Abstract: Standard representational similarity methods align each layer of a network to
its best match in another independently, producing asymmetric results, lacking
a global alignment score, and struggling with networks of different depths.
These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and
restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose
Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers
soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport
plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target
layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This
yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a
soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass
distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and
human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses
standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth,
fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers,
deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by
distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns
emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent
in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable
comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in
architecture or depth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模流行病学研究中，需要从被动收集的手腕加速度计数据中准确识别人类活动强度，以研究体力活动与健康结果之间的关联。

Method: 使用151名CAPTURE-24参与者的数据，训练18层改进的ResNet-V2自监督模型（ActiNet），然后结合隐马尔可夫模型进行平滑处理，通过5折分层组交叉验证评估性能。

Result: ActiNet模型的平均宏观F1得分为0.82，Cohen's kappa得分为0.86，显著优于传统随机森林+HMM方法的0.77和0.81，且在不同年龄和性别亚组中表现一致。

Conclusion: ActiNet模型在活动强度识别方面表现优异，建议在未来的流行病学研究中用于从手腕加速度计数据中提取活动强度标签。

Abstract: The use of reliable and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) models on
passively collected wrist-accelerometer data is essential in large-scale
epidemiological studies that investigate the association between physical
activity and health outcomes. While the use of self-supervised learning has
generated considerable excitement in improving HAR, it remains unknown the
extent to which these models, coupled with hidden Markov models (HMMs), would
make a tangible improvement to classification performance, and the effect this
may have on the predicted daily activity intensity compositions. Using 151
CAPTURE-24 participants' data, we trained the ActiNet model, a self-supervised,
18-layer, modified ResNet-V2 model, followed by hidden Markov model (HMM)
smoothing to classify labels of activity intensity. The performance of this
model, evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, was then
compared to a baseline random forest (RF) + HMM, established in existing
literature. Differences in performance and classification outputs were compared
with different subgroups of age and sex within the Capture-24 population. The
ActiNet model was able to distinguish labels of activity intensity with a mean
macro F1 score of 0.82, and mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86. This exceeded the
performance of the RF + HMM, trained and validated on the same dataset, with
mean scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. These findings were consistent
across subgroups of age and sex. These findings encourage the use of ActiNet
for the extraction of activity intensity labels from wrist-accelerometer data
in future epidemiological studies.

Abstract: This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and
providing convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed
throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and
collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing
multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,
enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive
understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML
system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling,
power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource
management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization
problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining
block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which
provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical
convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss
function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance
under different data settings.

### [109] [Accelerating Attention with Basis Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01718)
*Jialin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BD Attention (BDA) 是首个无损的注意力算法重构，通过基础分解矩阵恒等式重新组织多头投影，在保持精确输出的同时实现数学保证的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力是大型语言模型和视觉语言模型的核心操作，现有优化主要关注I/O层面的系统优化，缺乏数学保证的无损算法重构。

Method: 利用基础分解(BD)的简单矩阵恒等式，将多头投影重新组织为紧凑形式，无需重新训练，仅需4秒离线准备。

Result: 在DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16)上，BDA实现了32%更快的键值投影、25%更小的权重，端到端困惑度仅增加0.02%(FP16)或0.0004%(FP32)。

Conclusion: BDA是首个理论上精确的无损注意力加速方法，与现有工程级优化互补，为注意力机制提供了数学保证的加速方案。

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first
lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple
matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head
projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike
I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a
mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On
DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with
no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value
projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity
(PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model
performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method
for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing
engineering-level optimizations. Our code is available at

*Saptarshi Mandal,Yashaswini Murthy,R. Srikant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个使用线性函数逼近的鲁棒TD学习算法，解决了在模型不确定性下的强化学习问题，无需生成模型访问，样本复杂度为Õ(1/ε²)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的鲁棒TD学习收敛保证仅限于表格MDP或在函数逼近时需要限制性折扣因子假设，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 结合双时间尺度随机逼近更新和外循环目标网络更新，针对总变差距离和Wasserstein-l距离不确定性集设计鲁棒TD学习。

Result: 建立了Õ(1/ε²)的样本复杂度以获得ε-精确的价值估计，填补了鲁棒RL算法经验成功与非鲁棒对应物理论保证之间的关键差距。

Conclusion: 该算法是模型无关的，不需要MDP的生成访问，关键思想可以相对直接地扩展到具有函数逼近的鲁棒Q学习。

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing
policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In
particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted
reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed
environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty
set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD)
learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on
restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We
present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where
robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and
Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both
model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm
combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop
target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample
complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a
key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the
non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key
ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to
robust Q-learning with function approximation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用深度神经网络(DNN)替代传统离散选择模型(DCM)来建模工作地点选择，DNN在某些方面表现优于DCM，但两种模型各有优势，应根据具体应用需求选择合适模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散选择模型在准确反映个人决策过程方面面临挑战，需要开发能更好理解复杂决策模式的方法。

Method: 使用深度神经网络(DNN)方法建模工作地点选择决策，并与传统离散选择模型(DCM)进行比较分析。

Result: DNN在工作地点选择建模中显示出作为DCM稳健替代方案的潜力。两种模型都能有效复制工作机会的影响，但DNN在某些方面表现更优，而DCM在评估个体属性对工作距离影响时与数据更吻合。DCM在短距离表现更好，DNN在长距离与数据和DCM表现相当。

Conclusion: 在工作地点选择分析中，应根据具体应用需求选择合适的模型，两种方法各有优势，需要权衡使用。

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) have long been used to analyze workplace
location decisions, but they face challenges in accurately mirroring individual
decision-making processes. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)
method for modeling workplace location choices, which aims to better understand
complex decision patterns and provides better results than traditional discrete
choice models (DCMs). The study demonstrates that DNNs show significant
potential as a robust alternative to DCMs in this domain. While both models
effectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location
choices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM
better aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes
on workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs
perform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings
underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific
application requirements in workplace location choice analysis.

TL;DR: 本文分析了差分隐私随机梯度下降(DPSGD)对模型公平性的影响，发现直接优化DP模型的超参数虽不能可靠缓解公平性差异影响，但相比重用非私有模型超参数能改善效用-公平性权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DPSGD对模型公平性的影响，验证直接优化DP模型超参数是否能达到与非私有模型相当的公平性水平。

Method: 1)比较DPSGD对不同性能指标的差异性影响；2)在广泛超参数设置下分析；3)扩展到DPSGD-Global-Adapt变体。

Result: DPSGD对不同指标的差异性影响不一致；直接优化DP模型超参数不能可靠缓解公平性差异，但能改善效用-公平性权衡；DPSGD-Global-Adapt对超参数选择不稳健。

Conclusion: 超参数调优会带来额外隐私泄露，需要谨慎平衡隐私、效用和公平性；直接优化DP模型超参数是改善效用-公平性权衡的有效方法，但不能完全解决公平性问题。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a prominent method for protecting information
about individuals during data analysis. Training neural networks with
differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the
model's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output. This can affect the
model's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic
report a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that
fairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing
hyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models
(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common
practice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1)
comparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and
2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that
a disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact
on another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters
directly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate
impact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness
trade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We
stress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional
privacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy,
utility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a
variant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and
conclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to
hyperparameter choice.

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督动态特征选择方法，通过移除图像中的误导性和冗余信息来增强潜在表示，提高模型的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务中的潜在表示常受噪声和无关特征影响，这会降低模型性能和泛化能力。

Method: 使用无监督动态特征选择方法，针对每个实例识别并移除图像中的误导或冗余信息，确保只有最相关特征贡献于潜在空间。

Result: 在图像数据集上的实验表明，配备无监督DFS的模型在聚类和图像生成等任务中显著提高了泛化性能，计算成本增加极小。

Conclusion: 无监督动态特征选择方法能有效增强潜在表示，提高模型性能，且不依赖标注数据，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of
machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a
compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations
are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the
model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a
novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic
Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and
removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the
most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an
unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it
broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted
on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS
achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various
tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal
increase in the computational cost.

TL;DR: Octax是一个基于JAX的高性能经典街机游戏环境套件，为强化学习研究提供GPU加速的替代方案，相比传统CPU模拟器实现数量级的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频游戏环境计算成本高且不适合大规模实验，需要提供既具有挑战性又可在GPU上大规模执行的环境套件。

Method: 基于CHIP-8模拟在JAX中实现经典街机游戏环境，提供端到端的GPU加速，支持图像环境并涵盖解谜、动作和策略等多种游戏类型。

Result: 实现了相比传统CPU模拟器数量级的速度提升，同时保持对原始游戏机制的完美保真度，显著提高了训练速度和可扩展性。

Conclusion: Octax为大规模强化学习实验提供了理想的平台，其模块化设计便于扩展新游戏或使用大语言模型生成新环境。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) research requires diverse, challenging
environments that are both tractable and scalable. While modern video games may
offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for
large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce
Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented
in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely
adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a
long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering
image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all
executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation
achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while
maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate
Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing
significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing
solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily
extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large
language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL
experimentation.

<details>

Motivation: 在从数据中学习非正则哈密顿动力学时，长期预测需要在学习模型和数值方案中同时保持结构。先前研究分别关注基于势能的架构和退化变分积分器，但结合两者时会出现新的数值不稳定问题。

Method: 提出两种训练策略：1）直接学习向量场；2）通过方案学习时间离散动力学。使用数值测试案例评估方法学习复杂物理动力学的能力。

Result: 方法能够有效学习复杂的物理动力学，如陀螺动力学等离子体物理中的引导中心模型，解决了先前方法中的数值不稳定问题。

Conclusion: 提出的训练策略成功解决了非正则哈密顿动力学学习中的数值不稳定问题，使得长期模拟成为可能，为复杂物理系统的学习提供了有效方法。

Abstract: This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data,
where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the
learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either
facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate
variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In
experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the
gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In
this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training
strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by
learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test
cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics,
like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.

Motivation: 验证后处理隐私过滤技术在医学AI研究中生成隐私保护合成数据集的有效性，因为其效果尚未得到充分验证。

Method: 对胸部X光合成应用过滤管道进行严格评估，分析过滤器在检测真实图像和训练数据生成的近重复样本方面的表现。

Result: 当前过滤器特异性有限且不一致，对真实图像具有高敏感性，但无法可靠检测训练数据生成的近重复样本。

Conclusion: 后处理过滤方法存在严重局限性，在敏感应用中部署前需要过滤器设计的重大改进。

Abstract: The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue
for overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering
techniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable
information, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their
effectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous
evaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary
to claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current
filters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity
only for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated
from training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc
filtering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods
may provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of
patient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter
design are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种宽-窄-宽（沙漏型）MLP块结构，通过在高维空间进行跳跃连接而在窄瓶颈层进行残差计算，相比传统窄-宽-窄MLP设计在生成任务中实现了更优的性能-参数帕累托前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统MLP的窄-宽-窄设计惯例，探索在高维空间进行跳跃连接、在窄瓶颈层进行残差计算的沙漏型结构是否能够提供更好的性能。

Method: 设计沙漏型MLP块，其中跳跃连接在扩展维度上操作，而残差计算流经窄瓶颈层；使用随机初始化的固定投影将输入信号提升到扩展维度；在图像生成任务上通过系统架构搜索评估性能-参数帕累托前沿。

Result: 沙漏架构在多个流行图像数据集上始终优于传统设计；随着参数预算增加，最优沙漏配置倾向于更深的网络、更宽的跳跃连接和更窄的瓶颈层，这与传统MLP的扩展模式不同。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要重新考虑现代架构中跳跃连接的位置，这种设计思路可能扩展到Transformer和其他残差网络。

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) conventionally follow a narrow-wide-narrow
design where skip connections operate at the input/output dimensions while
processing occurs in expanded hidden spaces. We challenge this convention by
proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections
operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow
bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental
refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched
designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift
input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can
remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient
training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on
generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing
performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search.
Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto
frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase,
optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip
connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from
conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement
in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers
and other residual networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多头注意力机制存在二次计算复杂度问题，虽然MQA和GQA解决了内存带宽瓶颈，但未减少注意力分数计算所需的FLOPs，这成为训练和全序列处理的关键瓶颈。

Method: 引入SQA架构，通过减少查询头数量而非键/值头来直接降低注意力计算复杂度，提出了理论基础和数学公式，以及一系列架构变体。

Result: 在32k-200k令牌的长序列基准测试中，SQA在计算受限场景下实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升，在初步小规模实验中模型质量影响极小。

Conclusion: SQA作为一种补充优化路径，是构建更高效可扩展模型的强大工具，在开发反应式Transformer架构时偶然发现。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布估计算法依赖学习显式变量依赖图，成本高且难以有效捕捉复杂交互。需要一种更高效的组合优化方法。

Method: 使用多变量自回归生成模型，在训练时随机采样生成顺序（信息保留dropout），使模型对变量顺序不变，并采用GRPO进行稳定策略梯度更新。

Result: 在多种基准算法和不同规模问题实例上，该方法经常获得最佳性能，并始终避免灾难性失败。

Conclusion: 该方法通过顺序不变性提高了组合优化的效率和鲁棒性，在多样问题上表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for
black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution
algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs,
which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In
contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model
trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders
during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is
encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity
and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies,
improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates
from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms
and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best
performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.

Abstract: The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection,
with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models
for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive
hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different
types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction
emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search
through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc
prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the
intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional
models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of
AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical
information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to
the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark
containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The
proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing
computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given
dataset.

Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems
against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have
shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains,
representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We
introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that
leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned
representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a
shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On
industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both
algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings.We
further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to
downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings
demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning
representations for formal languages.

Abstract: Symmetry is widely applied in problems such as the design of equivariant
networks and the discovery of governing equations, but in complex scenarios, it
is not known in advance. Most previous symmetry discovery methods are limited
to linear symmetries, and recent attempts to discover nonlinear symmetries fail
to explicitly get the Lie algebra subspace. In this paper, we propose LieNLSD,
which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number
of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit
expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action
and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation
formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear
with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences
of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the
infinitesimal criterion, we get a system of linear equations for the
coefficient matrix, which can then be solved using SVD. On top quark tagging
and a series of dynamic systems, LieNLSD shows qualitative advantages over
existing methods and improves the long rollout accuracy of neural PDE solvers
by over 20% while applying to guide data augmentation. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/hulx2002/LieNLSD.

Result: 模型成功恢复了规则学习和运动学习任务中的真实组件和统计信息，并能从单个示例快速推断新解决方案

Conclusion: 该框架结合了神经网络的表达能力和概率推理的数据效率，实现了快速组合式元学习

Abstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively
reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning.
Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly
recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for
meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that
explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable
computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the
underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks.
This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference
problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through
highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground
truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We
then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single
examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks
with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid
compositional meta-learning.

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the celebrated Online Convex Optimization
(OCO) framework with online adversarial constraints. We present two algorithms
having simple modular structures that yield universal dynamic regret and
cumulative constraint violation bounds, improving upon the state-of-the-art
results. Our results hold in the most general case when both the cost and
constraint functions are chosen arbitrarily by an adversary, and the constraint
functions need not contain any common feasible point. The results are
established by reducing the constrained learning problem to an instance of the
standard OCO problem with specially constructed surrogate cost functions.

Motivation: 训练大型语言模型常受限于极端内存需求，其中优化器状态占主导地位。现有方法通过将梯度投影到低维子空间来缓解这一成本，但需要更深入地理解梯度空间的动态特性。

Method: 分析了梯度空间及其子空间的动态特性，发现核心子空间的影响随时间推移和在深层网络中减弱，且梯度空间呈现近乎平坦的曲率。基于这些洞察，提出了GrassWalk和GrassJump随机算法，利用子空间特性进行优化。

Conclusion: 梯度空间分析揭示了重要的动态特性，基于这些洞察设计的算法能够有效减少内存需求并改善训练效果，为大模型训练提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is often bottlenecked by extreme memory
demands, with optimizer states dominating the footprint. Recent works mitigates
this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using
sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of
gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small
subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in
the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over
time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits
near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this
geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized
algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve
state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and
LLaMA-7B pretraining.

TL;DR: 提出MMtSBM方法，用于从无配对数据生成视频，通过多边际时间Schrödinger桥匹配来重构隐藏的动态过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多自然动态过程（如细胞分化、疾病进展）只能通过静态样本快照观察，需要重构其时间演化来理解动态特性。现有方法在高维情况下可扩展性差且需要严格假设。

Method: 扩展Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge Matching，推导出多边际情况下的迭代马尔可夫拟合算法，采用新颖的因子化方式处理多个边际分布。

Result: 在玩具示例上保持理论性质，在真实世界数据集（如100维转录组轨迹推断）上达到最先进性能，首次在超高维图像设置中恢复耦合和动态。

Conclusion: 多边际Schrödinger桥为从静态数据恢复隐藏动态提供了一种实用且理论严谨的方法。

Abstract: Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or
disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample
snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to
decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific
research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but
are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be
met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal
temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video
generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and
empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching
(arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting
algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show
that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic
trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers
couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work
establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled
approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断模型孤立分析各种医疗数据源，无法捕捉跨模态相关性，限制了早期疾病诊断能力。需要整合多样化患者数据来提升诊断精度。

Method: 使用专用编码器将各模态数据映射到共享潜在空间，通过多头注意力和残差归一化进行融合，支持多任务预训练架构，便于适应新疾病和数据集。

Result: 在肿瘤学、心脏病学和神经学基准数据集上进行早期检测任务测试，模型包含数据治理和模型管理工具，提高透明度、可靠性和临床可解释性。

Conclusion: 该多模态基础模型为精准诊断提供了统一框架，有望提高预测准确性并辅助临床决策。

Abstract: Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health
records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable
devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in
isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations
essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal
foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an
attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each
modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head
attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining
on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with
little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark
datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early
detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management
tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency,
reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a
single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the
accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.

TL;DR: 本文探索了Tsetlin Machine在大型多通道图像分类中的应用，提出了生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法，在保持可解释性的同时达到了与深度学习模型竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tsetlin Machine作为一种基于有限状态自动机和命题逻辑的新型机器学习范式，比神经网络更具可解释性。本文旨在探索其在大型多通道RGB图像分类中的适用性。

Method: 提出了生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法论。局部解释用于解释模型预测，全局类别表示聚合每个类别的重要模式。这些解释总结了卷积子句捕获的知识，可以可视化为图像。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到98.5%准确率，在CelebA数据集上达到86.56% F1分数（相比ResNet50的88.07%）。TM在保持可解释性的同时，性能与深度学习模型相当。

Conclusion: Tsetlin Machine在复杂大规模训练环境中仍能保持竞争力，同时维持其可解释性优势。这有助于更好地理解TM子句，并为将这类模型应用于更复杂多样的数据集提供了见解。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a novel machine learning paradigm that employs
finite-state automata for learning and utilizes propositional logic to
represent patterns. Due to its simplistic approach, TMs are inherently more
interpretable than learning algorithms based on Neural Networks. The
Convolutional TM has shown comparable performance on various datasets such as
MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR-2. In this paper, we explore the
applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image
classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations
and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to
explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate
important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the
knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as
images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that
achieve 98.5\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to
88.07\% for ResNet50) respectively. We show that the TM performs competitively
to this deep learning model while maintaining its interpretability, even in
large-scale complex training environments. This contributes to a better
understanding of TM clauses and provides insights into how these models can be
applied to more complex and diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RoGRAD框架，首次通过检索增强生成和迭代图对比学习来解决图神经网络在复合缺陷下的性能问题，相比传统方法和LLM增强方法有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图数据存在多种缺陷，严重削弱GNN性能。现有研究缺乏对图原生方法和LLM增强方法在复合缺陷下表现的全面比较，且LLM增强的优越性假设尚未得到验证。

Method: 提出RoGRAD框架，采用检索增强生成(RAG)注入类别一致且多样化的增强，通过迭代图对比学习强制区分性表示，将LLM增强从静态信号注入转变为动态精炼。

Result: RoGRAD在广泛实验中优于传统GNN和LLM增强基线，平均提升达到82.43%。

Conclusion: RoGRAD是首个迭代范式，通过RAG和对比学习有效应对图数据复合缺陷，挑战了LLM增强始终优越的假设，为图学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications,
serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as
text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit
deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior
GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual
imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is
still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation
comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving
their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study
that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies,
revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM
augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we
propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement
(RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is
the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent,
diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through
iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs
from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments
demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced
baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA方法在性能上仍落后于全参数微调，部分原因是未能充分利用低秩流形的几何结构。

Method: 使用三因子分解U、S、V⊤，约束U和V在Stiefel流形上保持正交性，采用几何优化设计将欧几里得优化器转换为黎曼优化器。

Result: 在常识推理、数学和代码生成、图像分类、图像生成等多种下游任务中，该方法优于当前最先进的LoRA变体。

Conclusion: 提出的几何感知LoRA扩展方法能够更有效地学习子空间，同时保持与现有微调管道的兼容性，在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as a parameter-efficient
technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. However, it still
lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient
exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this
paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor
decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value
decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$
and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie
on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training.
To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric
optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one.
It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing
fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream
tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image
classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA. Code is

Conclusion: Moon框架通过模态转换和多模态融合，有效解决了现有MTS异常检测方法的局限性，在效率、准确性和可解释性方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns
where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly
detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based,
prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two
key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based
and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to
inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often
underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised
learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture
local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a
supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection
framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while
providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel
multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time
series data into image representations, capturing relationships across
variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that
cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a
Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion
model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a
SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to
anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world
MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by
up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation
performance.

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow
models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative
models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential
Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse
denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively
explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference
alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves
precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in
reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic
Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration
while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise,
thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently,
to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages
computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and
robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various
reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations,
demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing
flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Calibrating machine learning models so that predicted probabilities better
reflect the true outcome frequencies is crucial for reliable decision-making
across many applications. In Federated Learning (FL), the goal is to train a
global model on data which is distributed across multiple clients and cannot be
centralized due to privacy concerns. FL is applied in key areas such as
healthcare and finance where calibration is strongly required, yet federated
private calibration has been largely overlooked. This work introduces the
integration of post-hoc model calibration techniques within FL. Specifically,
we transfer traditional centralized calibration methods such as histogram
binning and temperature scaling into federated environments and define new
methods to operate them under strong client heterogeneity. We study (1) a
federated setting and (2) a user-level Differential Privacy (DP) setting and
demonstrate how both federation and DP impacts calibration accuracy. We propose
strategies to mitigate degradation commonly observed under heterogeneity and
our findings highlight that our federated temperature scaling works best for
DP-FL whereas our weighted binning approach is best when DP is not required.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptide discovery is challenged by the astronomical size of
peptide space and the relative scarcity of active peptides. Generative models
provide continuous latent "maps" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore
decoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering
exploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based
remedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in
practice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware
framework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a
Union of $\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$, a family
of decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring
computational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order
Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent
second-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation
Enumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete
amino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian
Optimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.
Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which
interpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,
biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro
validation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel
seeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active
peptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial
strains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides
a powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.

TL;DR: 提出了GraphNC框架，通过异常分数分布对齐和扰动正则化来校准图异常检测中的正态性，提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督图异常检测方法仅基于标注的正常节点学习正态性，容易过拟合，导致高误报率。需要利用未标注数据来校准正态性。

Method: GraphNC包含两个组件：异常分数分布对齐（ScoreDA）和基于扰动的正态性正则化（NormReg）。ScoreDA通过对齐教师模型的分数分布来优化异常分数，NormReg通过最小化扰动一致性损失来使正常节点表示更紧凑。

Result: 该方法能够将正常和异常类别的异常分数推向两端，产生更可分离的异常分数，同时使正常节点表示更紧凑。

Conclusion: GraphNC通过联合利用标注和未标注数据，在异常分数和节点表示空间中校准正态性，有效提升了半监督图异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial
ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised
GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during
training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the
normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the
labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These
can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome
this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework
that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from
a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly
score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components,
anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality
regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by
aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to
accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in
the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of
the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more
separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the
teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed
to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the
representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a
perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.

Abstract: As AI systems become more embedded in everyday life, the development of fair
and unbiased models becomes more critical. Considering the social impact of AI
systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As
evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust
representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing
algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for
prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that
utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior
robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing
interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in
these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we
introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address
bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically
selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised
contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing
state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum
trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in
various downstream tasks.

Abstract: In deep learning, dense layer connectivity has become a key design principle
in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling efficient information flow and strong
performance across a range of applications. In this work, we model densely
connected DNNs mathematically and analyze their learning problems in the
deep-layer limit. For a broad applicability, we present our analysis in a
framework setting of DNNs with densely connected layers and general non-local
feature transformations (with local feature transformations as special cases)
within layers, which is called dense non-local (DNL) framework and includes
standard DenseNets and variants as special examples. In this formulation, the
densely connected networks are modeled as nonlinear integral equations, in
contrast to the ordinary differential equation viewpoint commonly adopted in
prior works. We study the associated training problems from an optimal control
perspective and prove convergence results from the network learning problem to
its continuous-time counterpart. In particular, we show the convergence of
optimal values and the subsequence convergence of minimizers, using a piecewise
linear extension and $\Gamma$-convergence analysis. Our results provide a
mathematical foundation for understanding densely connected DNNs and further
suggest that such architectures can offer stability of training deep models.

Motivation: Flow Matching算法在训练阶段无法评估模型输出，存在训练-推理差距，特别是在机器人操作等高精度场景中问题更明显。同时FM过度追求直线路径可能导致系统刚度等问题。

Method: 通过最大似然估计对FM进行微调，包括直接微调和基于残差的微调方法。基于残差的微调通过特定架构设计可以融入收缩特性，增强模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在图像生成和机器人操作任务中可靠地提升了Flow Matching的推理性能。

Conclusion: 通过最大似然估计微调Flow Matching是有效的，能够缩小训练-推理差距，提高模型在生成任务中的表现，特别是在需要高精度的场景中。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks
especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion
models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient
training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we
cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other
generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction
loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high
precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's
over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems
such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by
FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first
theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error
in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood
Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning
and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically
designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the
contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's
robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and
robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference
performance of FM.

Motivation: 在万维网应用中，可靠的时间序列预测对资源规划、缓存放置和异常响应至关重要，需要比传统领域更快的响应速度来支持实时决策。

Method: 提出KAIROS非自回归时间序列预测框架，直接建模分段级多峰分布，避免自回归方法的误差累积，实现即时推理。

Result: 在大规模语料库上训练的KAIROS在六个广泛使用的基准测试中表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，预测性能与类似规模的先进基础模型相当，但推理成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: KAIROS强调了非自回归设计作为时间序列基础模型可扩展范式的重要性，为Web应用提供了高效的实时预测解决方案。

Abstract: In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the
forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and
anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior
and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series
forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support
real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series
forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak
distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error
accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing
non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained
on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization
on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to
state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their
inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of
non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time
series.

Conclusion: 研究表明高质量权重空间表示可以在非结构化环境中学习，证明精心构建的模型动物园并非不可或缺，克服了权重空间学习社区当前面临的重要限制。

Abstract: The weights of neural networks have emerged as a novel data modality, giving
rise to the field of weight space learning. A central challenge in this area is
that learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large,
carefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as
model zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large
computational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations
in scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a
weight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large,
unstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model
zoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in
architecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the
methodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight
space backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We
demonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging
Face achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on
laboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the
model weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize
to unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space
representations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are
not indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by
the weight space learning community.

Motivation: AdaBoost在实践中随着弱学习器数量增加而泛化良好，但其指数损失难以用一阶方法优化。作者希望开发一个既保留AdaBoost优势又适合现代深度学习优化的损失函数。

Method: 提出了PENEX损失函数，这是一个理论上有依据的多类指数损失新公式，证明它能隐式最大化数据点的边界，并且梯度增量隐式参数化了提升框架中的弱学习器。

Result: 在计算机视觉和语言任务上的实验表明，PENEX表现出比类似计算成本的现有方法更好的正则化效果。

Conclusion: PENEX有潜力作为AdaBoost启发的替代方案，用于深度神经网络的有效训练和微调。

Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential
loss, which penalizes mislabeled data points more severely than other loss
functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in
practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we
introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the
multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to
the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes
margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX
implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across
computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing
effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost.
Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for
effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.

Abstract: Today, natural gas, as a clean fuel and the best alternative to crude oil,
covers a significant part of global demand. Iran is one of the largest
countries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest
country in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy
consumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in
cold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption,
especially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This
study aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in
Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and
a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and
meteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were
trained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption
patterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model
outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean
Percentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust
performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest
that machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be
effectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to
more efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study
highlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in
predictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across
different regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在误差独立时表现良好，而去混杂先行的流程依赖于普遍存在的因子结构或非线性。需要一种能够处理潜在混杂的统一方法。

Method: 提出DECOR，一种基于似然的完全可微分估计器，交替执行平滑无环图更新和凸噪声更新，可包含轻量级弓形互补惩罚或后处理协调步骤。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，DECOR匹配或优于强基线方法，特别是在混杂非普遍存在时表现稳健，在普遍存在时仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: DECOR为存在潜在混杂的线性高斯SEMs提供了一种有效的联合学习方法，理论保证了在弓形自由图和噪声协方差具有均匀特征值边界时的全局参数可识别性。

Abstract: We study structure learning for linear Gaussian SEMs in the presence of
latent confounding. Existing continuous methods excel when errors are
independent, while deconfounding-first pipelines rely on pervasive factor
structure or nonlinearity. We propose \textsc{DECOR}, a single likelihood-based
and fully differentiable estimator that jointly learns a DAG and a correlated
noise model. Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter
identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a
uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from $(\B,\OmegaMat)$ to the
observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the
noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph
update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity
penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step. On synthetic benchmarks that vary
confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimension with $n<p$,
\textsc{DECOR} matches or outperforms strong baselines and is especially robust
when confounding is non-pervasive, while remaining competitive under
pervasiveness.

Abstract: Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the
adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations
in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen
energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However,
the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process
remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative
model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and
adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts.
We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept
application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for
which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst.
In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution
reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open
the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework
offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient
catalysts.

Conclusion: 引导技术可以成功地从扩散策略扩展到标准在线策略方法，为可控在线强化学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of
classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient
methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and
interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time
control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a
theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes
under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update.
Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We
find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in
simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes
continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$)
consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our
results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be
adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable
online reinforcement learning.

executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate
GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns
highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we
demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to
both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth
rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in
multi-task setups.

Abstract: Objective: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that is endemic to South
America, Central America, and, more recently, the U.S., primarily transmitted
by insects. Chronic Chagas disease can cause cardiovascular diseases and
digestive problems. Serological testing capacities for Chagas disease are
limited, but Chagas cardiomyopathy often manifests in ECGs, providing an
opportunity to prioritize patients for testing and treatment. Approach: The
George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop algorithmic
approaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main
results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged
several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing,
provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong
labels. Second, we augmented the data to support model robustness and
generalizability to unseen data sources. Third, we applied an evaluation metric
that captured the local serological testing capacity for Chagas disease to
frame the machine learning problem as a triage task. Significance: Over 630
participants from 111 teams submitted over 1300 entries during the Challenge,
representing diverse approaches from academia and industry worldwide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在长序列上存在二次复杂度问题，限制了其实际应用。需要开发更高效的序列建模方法。

Method: 使用递归定义的SkipBlocks结构，包含残差块、下池化层、嵌套SkipBlock、上池化层和额外残差块，用循环层替代自注意力。

Result: 池化操作显著加速训练，改善感知指标（FID和IS），防止过拟合。在原始音频数据上优于SaShiMi和Mamba等最先进模型。

Conclusion: Poolformer为长序列处理提供了有效解决方案，深层处理长程依赖，浅层处理短期特征，未来可扩展到文本、视觉和多模态应用。

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture. While
initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have
demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models
require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically
using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales
quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long
sequences.
  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces
self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to
reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks,
which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an
up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive
experiments to support our architectural choices.
  Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves
perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also
suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow
layers take care of short-term features.
  Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths,
Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.
Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as
multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process
dense representations of images and videos.

decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

*Hanyang Zhao,Dawen Liang,Wenpin Tang,David Yao,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiFFPO是一个统一的强化学习框架，用于训练掩码扩散大语言模型，使其推理能力更强（furious）且更快。通过离策略RL训练代理策略，结合两阶段似然近似和重要性采样校正，提高样本效率和任务性能。同时联合训练高效采样器/控制器，让模型自适应分配推理阈值，在减少函数评估次数的同时获得更好准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如d1在训练扩散大语言模型时存在效率问题，需要统一的框架来同时提升推理质量和速度。通过强化学习优化模型不仅能提高性能，还能减少推理时的计算成本。

Method: 1. 使用离策略RL训练代理策略，采用两阶段似然近似和重要性采样校正；2. 联合训练高效采样器/控制器，让模型自适应分配每个提示的推理阈值；3. 在数学和规划基准任务上训练开源大扩散语言模型。

Conclusion: DiFFPO框架通过强化学习有效提升了扩散大语言模型的推理能力和效率，实现了性能与计算成本之间的更好平衡。

Abstract: We propose DiFFPO, Diffusion Fast and Furious Policy Optimization, a unified
framework for training masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to reason
not only better (furious), but also faster via reinforcement learning (RL). We
first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train
surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable
as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more
accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with
importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with
better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a
new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy.
Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by
letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each
prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower
number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only,
obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the
inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline
by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and
planning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出C2AL方法，通过辅助学习解决推荐系统中数据异构性问题，利用注意力机制进行共享嵌入选择，通过部分冲突的辅助标签正则化共享表示，提升模型对少数群体的学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界推荐数据由异质群体组成，但单一全局目标训练的大规模推荐模型会忽视头尾分布区域，导致注意力权重失效或神经元死亡，限制了模型学习能力。

Method: 分析数据集子结构，通过具有强分布对比的辅助学习暴露异质群体；利用部分冲突的辅助标签正则化共享表示；定制注意力层学习过程以保持与少数群体的互信息。

Result: 在包含数十亿数据点的生产数据集上评估6个SOTA模型，因子分解机能够捕获细粒度用户-广告交互，整体归一化熵降低0.16%，目标少数群体收益超过0.30%。

Conclusion: C2AL方法通过注意力机制和辅助学习有效解决了推荐系统中的数据异构性问题，在保持全局性能的同时显著提升了对少数群体的建模效果。

Abstract: Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective
implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world
data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional
distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is
used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns,
neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning
ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this
paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in
factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address
this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those
with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous
research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to
mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to
regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning
process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority
cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive
production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models.
Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained
user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16%
reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on
targeted minority cohorts.

*Maximilian Beck,Kajetan Schweighofer,Sebastian Böck,Sebastian Lehner,Sepp Hochreiter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了Transformer和xLSTM的扩展规律，发现在典型的大语言模型训练和推理场景中，xLSTM比Transformer具有更有利的扩展特性，且随着训练和推理上下文长度的增加，xLSTM的优势更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer一直是主导架构，但像xLSTM这样的替代方案在保持竞争力的同时具有线性复杂度。研究这两种架构的扩展行为可以为未来模型设计和部署提供指导。

Method: 采用IsoFLOP和参数拟合方法，在广泛模型规模(80M-7B)和训练token数量(2B-2T)范围内研究xLSTM在计算最优和过训练状态下的扩展行为；考察最优模型大小对上下文长度的依赖性；分析推理时的扩展特性。

Result: 在典型的大语言模型训练和推理场景中，xLSTM比Transformer扩展更有利。xLSTM的优势随着训练和推理上下文长度的增加而扩大。

Conclusion: xLSTM在扩展方面表现出比Transformer更有利的特性，特别是在长上下文场景中，这为未来模型架构选择提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Scaling laws play a central role in the success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling the prediction of model performance relative to compute
budgets prior to training. While Transformers have been the dominant
architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with
respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter
regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of
Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide
future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for
xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and
parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of
training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model
sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous
work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings
reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales
favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as
training and inference contexts grow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中用户设备可以在多个网络切片间无缝切换，这种灵活性带来了分布式切片移动性攻击的漏洞，可能导致分布式拒绝服务攻击。

Method: 采用正未标记学习，结合长短期记忆自编码器和K-Means聚类，利用3GPP关键性能指标和性能测量计数器作为机器学习模型的特征。

Result: 在基于free5GC和UERANSIM的5G测试平台上评估，当训练数据包含10%到40%攻击污染时，F1分数超过98.50%，优于其他基于正未标记学习的解决方案。

Conclusion: PUL-Inter-Slice Defender能够有效检测分布式切片移动性攻击变体，并在存在污染训练数据的情况下保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical
infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while
maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G)
networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between
multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as
Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be
exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their
NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an
anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and
incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means
clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters
as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while
maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When
evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source
free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator;
PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training
datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its
counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.

TL;DR: 提出ExGRPO框架，通过经验管理和混合策略优化改进RLVR训练效率，在数学/通用基准上平均提升3.5/7.6分


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准在线策略训练丢弃经验导致计算效率低下和不稳定，需要探索经验特性对大型推理模型学习动态的影响

Method: 识别推理经验价值指标（正确性和熵），提出ExGRPO框架组织优先处理有价值经验，采用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用

Result: 在5个骨干模型上实验显示，ExGRPO在数学/通用基准上平均提升3.5/7.6分，并在强弱模型上稳定训练

Conclusion: 原则性经验管理是高效可扩展RLVR的关键要素

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究表明，未经修改的标准Transformer可以直接在笛卡尔坐标上训练，无需预定义图结构或物理先验，就能达到与最先进等变GNN相竞争的分子能量和力预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在分子机器学习中依赖预定义的图结构（如固定半径截断或k近邻），这种硬编码的图结构限制了表达能力（固定感受野）并降低了推理速度。本文探索是否纯Transformer可以直接处理笛卡尔坐标来近似分子能量和力。

Method: 使用标准Transformer架构，直接在笛卡尔坐标上训练，不引入预定义图结构或物理先验。在OMol25数据集上，在匹配的训练计算预算下与最先进的等变GNN进行比较。

Result: Transformer达到了与最先进等变GNN相竞争的能量和力平均绝对误差。Transformer自适应学习了物理一致的注意力模式（如注意力权重与原子间距离成反比衰减），并能灵活适应不同分子环境。标准Transformer还展现出可预测的训练资源扩展改进。

Conclusion: Transformer能够自适应地学习GNN的许多有利特性，挑战了硬编码图归纳偏置的必要性，为分子建模指出了标准化、可扩展架构的方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular
machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on
predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor
scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular
tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive
field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we
investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian
coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical
priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a
starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to
competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training
compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25
dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent
patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with
interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different
molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a
standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to
scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in
other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs
can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded
graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures
for molecular modeling.

TL;DR: Diffusion^2是一个基于扩散模型的RF信号传播预测方法，使用3D点云数据在Wi-Fi到毫米波的宽频段内建模RF信号传播，比现有方法快27倍且误差仅为1.9 dB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RF信号传播建模对于环境理解和无线网络优化至关重要，但复杂环境中的准确预测仍具挑战性，因为RF信号会受到障碍物的吸收和反射等影响。

Method: 提出Diffusion^2方法，使用RF-3D编码器从3D点云中提取RF相关特征，通过多尺度嵌入模拟实际RF信号传播过程。

Result: 在合成和真实测量数据上的评估显示，Diffusion^2能在不同频段和环境条件下准确估计RF信号行为，误差仅为1.9 dB，速度比现有方法快27倍。

Conclusion: Diffusion^2在RF信号传播建模领域取得了显著进展，为无线诊断、部署和优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for
understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the
capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum,
lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless
diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF
signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with
obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a
diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of
RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves.
To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D
Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with
signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to
simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on
synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately
estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and
environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster
than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field. Refer to

Method: 发布代表两个主要城市道路网络的数据集，包含丰富的道路特征和细粒度的交通流量与速度数据。提出一种不使用专用时间序列处理模块的图神经网络方法，以获得更好的可扩展性。

Result: 大多数当前的神经时空交通预测模型难以扩展到该数据集规模。提出的替代方法在实现更好可扩展性的同时，也展示了更强的预测性能。

Conclusion: 该数据集和建模见解将为交通预测研究提供宝贵资源，推动更全面交通预测系统的构建。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant
practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from
the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks
(GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic
forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available
benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information
about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about
road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls
short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain
information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city
road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much
denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide
a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting
by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with
the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold
increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road
features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic
speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show
that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic
forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this
issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that
uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus
achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger
forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve
as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.

TL;DR: 本文指出当前LLM不确定性评估方法在QA基准测试中存在评估偏差问题，提出了多种替代风险指标来提高评估的鲁棒性，包括使用多个LLM-as-a-judge变体、结构化任务以及分布外和扰动检测任务，并建议使用Elo评分来客观总结不确定性评估方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检测LLM幻觉（特别是confabulations）的不确定性评估方法在QA数据集基准测试中，由于常用的近似正确性函数之间存在显著分歧，导致评估结果存在偏差，可能被用来夸大不确定性评估方法的性能。

Method: 1. 使用多个LLM-as-a-judge变体进行边际化处理以减少评估偏差；2. 探索结构化任务以及分布外和扰动检测任务，提供更鲁棒和可控的风险指标；3. 提出使用Elo评分对不确定性评估方法进行客观总结。

Conclusion: 需要采用多种替代风险指标和更全面的评估设置来可靠地评估LLM不确定性估计方法，提出的Elo评分方法能够为不确定性评估方法提供客观的总结性评价。

Abstract: Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large
language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of
hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive
uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating
predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been
developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty
estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA)
datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate
correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and,
consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows
one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We
propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation
experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms
for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge
variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore
structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection
tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we
propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an
objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多轮交互场景下容易受到对抗攻击，现有方法要么依赖人工红队测试，要么使用预定义模板，未能充分探索多轮攻击的复杂对话动态和策略规划。

Conclusion: DialTree-RPO框架能够自主发现多样化的多轮攻击策略，显著提高了对LLM安全漏洞的检测能力。

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

Conclusion: CNS实现了无融合操作，减少了持续个性化的内存存储和处理时间，为扩散模型的增量学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in
real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel
learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective
approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS
uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the
target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while
preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept
neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of
previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS
achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments,
outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization
works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and
processing time for continual personalization.

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,

automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,

Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and
flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an
implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an
optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are
obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step
sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation
performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on
ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and
sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework
that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD
detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with
a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and
energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

Motivation: 解决模型来源和未经授权的蒸馏复制问题，关注模型溯源和知识产权保护。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测知识蒸馏过程，为模型溯源提供实用工具。

Abstract: We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims to
determine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher,
under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher's
API are available. This problem is motivated by growing concerns about model
provenance and unauthorized replication through distillation. To address this
task, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free input
synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our
approach is applicable to both classification and generative models.
Experiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-image
generation show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongest
baselines by 59.6% on CIFAR-10, 71.2% on ImageNet, and 20.0% for text-to-image
generation. The code is available at

*Dhruv Kohli,Sawyer J. Robertson,Gal Mishne,Alexander Cloninger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LEGO方法，利用图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的梯度正交化来估计数据流形的切空间，相比传统LPCA方法在噪声环境下表现更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LPCA方法在高噪声环境下存在邻域大小选择的权衡问题，需要先验的几何和噪声信息，而这些信息通常难以获得。

Method: LEGO方法通过正交化图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的梯度来估计每个数据点的切空间，利用数据的全局结构指导局部切空间估计。

Result: 实验表明LEGO在噪声环境下比LPCA更稳健，在流形学习、边界检测和局部内在维度估计等下游任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: LEGO方法通过利用全局结构信息，有效解决了高噪声环境下切空间估计的挑战，为数据流形分析提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in
data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis
(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in
choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior
knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often
unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector
Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the
data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on
local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by
orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph
Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a
differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows
that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align
closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high
gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.
Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency
eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are
significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked
improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,
and local intrinsic dimension estimation.

TL;DR: KaVa框架通过从教师模型的压缩KV缓存中蒸馏知识到潜在推理学生模型，解决了显式思维链推理的计算成本高和潜在推理缺乏监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式思维链推理计算成本高且包含冗余信息，而潜在推理虽然高效但缺乏有效监督，限制了在复杂自然语言推理任务上的表现。

Method: 通过自蒸馏方法，利用压缩KV缓存作为监督信号，将教师模型的KV轨迹与潜在推理学生模型对齐，使用连续潜在令牌实现表示对齐。

Result: 该方法在潜在推理基准上持续优于强基线，从纯方程到自然语言轨迹的退化显著减小，并能扩展到更大的骨干网络同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 压缩KV缓存蒸馏为潜在推理提供了可扩展的监督信号，结合了思维链训练教师的准确性和潜在推理的效率和可部署性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant
computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic
artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that
internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of
supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning
traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this
gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher
into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the
representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV
trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within
compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a
rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the
approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly
smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales
to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish
compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent
reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency
and deployability of latent inference.

*Bo Li,Wei Wang,Peng Ye*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文改进了从可实现到不可知设置的私有学习转换，消除了对隐私参数ε的依赖，实现了接近最优的额外样本复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可实现到不可知转换在任意ε下会产生次优的额外样本复杂度，包含1/ε因子，需要改进以消除这种依赖。

Method: 提出改进的构造方法，利用私有不可知学习中的隐私成本主要来自可实现部分这一洞察。

Result: 实现了接近最优的额外样本复杂度O~(VC(C)/α²)，对任意ε≤1有效，解决了Dwork等人提出的开放问题。

Conclusion: 在私有不可知学习中，隐私成本主要来自可实现部分，改进的转换方法达到了接近最优的样本复杂度。

Abstract: The realizable-to-agnostic transformation (Beimel et al., 2015; Alon et al.,
2020) provides a general mechanism to convert a private learner in the
realizable setting (where the examples are labeled by some function in the
concept class) to a private learner in the agnostic setting (where no
assumptions are imposed on the data). Specifically, for any concept class
$\mathcal{C}$ and error parameter $\alpha$, a private realizable learner for
$\mathcal{C}$ can be transformed into a private agnostic learner while only
increasing the sample complexity by
$\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2)$, which is essentially tight
assuming a constant privacy parameter $\varepsilon = \Theta(1)$. However, when
$\varepsilon$ can be arbitrary, one has to apply the standard
privacy-amplification-by-subsampling technique (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2011),
resulting in a suboptimal extra sample complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2\varepsilon)$ that involves a
$1/\varepsilon$ factor.
  In this work, we give an improved construction that eliminates the dependence
on $\varepsilon$, thereby achieving a near-optimal extra sample complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2)$ for any $\varepsilon\le 1$.
Moreover, our result reveals that in private agnostic learning, the privacy
cost is only significant for the realizable part. We also leverage our
technique to obtain a nearly tight sample complexity bound for the private
prediction problem, resolving an open question posed by Dwork and Feldman
(2018) and Dagan and Feldman (2020).

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出CADD框架，通过将离散状态空间与连续潜在空间中的配对扩散相结合，解决标准离散扩散模型中信息丢失的问题，用含信息的噪声潜在向量替代吸收性[MASK]标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准离散扩散模型将所有未观测状态统一映射为吸收性[MASK]标记，导致语义信息在去噪步骤间丢失，形成'信息空洞'。

Method: 引入连续增强离散扩散(CADD)框架，在离散状态空间基础上增加连续潜在空间中的配对扩散，使掩码标记由含信息的噪声潜在向量表示，可在反向步骤中利用连续潜在作为语义提示指导离散去噪。

Result: 实验证明CADD在文本生成、图像合成和代码建模任务中均优于基于掩码的扩散方法，在定性和定量指标上相比强离散基线均获得一致提升。

Conclusion: CADD框架通过连续潜在空间的语义引导，实现了生成多样性和上下文精确性之间的可控权衡，显著提升了离散扩散模型的生成质量。

Abstract: Standard discrete diffusion models treat all unobserved states identically by
mapping them to an absorbing [MASK] token. This creates an 'information void'
where semantic information that could be inferred from unmasked tokens is lost
between denoising steps. We introduce Continuously Augmented Discrete Diffusion
(CADD), a framework that augments the discrete state space with a paired
diffusion in a continuous latent space. This yields graded, gradually corrupted
states in which masked tokens are represented by noisy yet informative latent
vectors rather than collapsed 'information voids'. At each reverse step, CADD
may leverage the continuous latent as a semantic hint to guide discrete
denoising. The design is clean and compatible with existing discrete diffusion
training. At sampling time, the strength and choice of estimator for the
continuous latent vector enables a controlled trade-off between mode-coverage
(generating diverse outputs) and mode-seeking (generating contextually precise
outputs) behaviors. Empirically, we demonstrate CADD improves generative
quality over mask-based diffusion across text generation, image synthesis, and
code modeling, with consistent gains on both qualitative and quantitative
metrics against strong discrete baselines.

TL;DR: 本文分析了线性回归中最小范数插值解在尖峰协方差数据模型下的泛化误差，揭示了尖峰强度、目标-尖峰对齐和过参数化程度如何影响风险，并识别了良性、温和和灾难性过拟合的不同机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究过参数化线性回归中最小范数解在尖峰协方差模型下的泛化性能，理解尖峰强度、目标对齐和维度-样本比如何共同决定过拟合行为。

Method: 使用尖峰协方差数据模型，推导出泛化误差的精确表达式，分析不同参数设置下的风险行为，包括尖峰强度、维度-样本比c=d/n（特别是c→∞时）和目标-尖峰对齐情况。

Result: 发现了三种过拟合机制：良性、温和和灾难性过拟合，并给出了明确的分类条件。在正确设定的对齐问题中，增加尖峰强度可能先导致灾难性过拟合，然后才能达到良性过拟合。目标-尖峰对齐并非总是有益的，存在特定条件下对齐反而有害的情况。

Conclusion: 尖峰协方差模型中的泛化误差行为复杂且有时违反直觉，目标-尖峰对齐在某些条件下可能有害，这一现象在非线性模型中同样存在。研究为理解过参数化模型的风险行为提供了新的理论见解。

Abstract: This paper analyzes the generalization error of minimum-norm interpolating
solutions in linear regression using spiked covariance data models. The paper
characterizes how varying spike strengths and target-spike alignments can
affect risk, especially in overparameterized settings. The study presents an
exact expression for the generalization error, leading to a comprehensive
classification of benign, tempered, and catastrophic overfitting regimes based
on spike strength, the aspect ratio $c=d/n$ (particularly as $c \to \infty$),
and target alignment. Notably, in well-specified aligned problems, increasing
spike strength can surprisingly induce catastrophic overfitting before
achieving benign overfitting. The paper also reveals that target-spike
alignment is not always advantageous, identifying specific, sometimes
counterintuitive, conditions for its benefit or detriment. Alignment with the
spike being detrimental is empirically demonstrated to persist in nonlinear
models.

Abstract: This paper introduces an Artificial Intelligence (AI) foundation model for
time series in engineering applications, where causal operations are required
for real-time monitoring and control. Since engineering time series are
governed by physical, rather than linguistic, laws, large-language-model-based
AI foundation models may be ineffective or inefficient. Building on the
classical innovations representation theory of Wiener, Kallianpur, and
Rosenblatt, we propose Time Series GPT (TS-GPT) -- an
innovations-representation-based Generative Pre-trained Transformer for
engineering monitoring and control. As an example of foundation model
adaptation, we consider Probabilistic Generative Forecasting, which produces
future time series samples from conditional probability distributions given
past realizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-GPT in forecasting
real-time locational marginal prices using historical data from U.S.
independent system operators.

Motivation: 设计分类核函数是高斯过程回归中面临的主要挑战，现有研究缺乏统一的评估标准、优化过程和可复现代码，难以确定首选方法。

Method: 对现有所有分类核函数进行可复现比较研究，提出受优化社区启发的新评估指标，在已知分组结构时使用嵌套核方法，在未知结构时提出基于目标编码的聚类策略。

Result: 在具有分组结构的数据集上，嵌套核方法明显优于其他方法；在无已知分组结构的数据集上，基于聚类的目标编码策略仍优于其他方法且计算成本低。

Conclusion: 嵌套核方法在已知分组结构时表现最佳，而基于聚类的目标编码策略在无先验知识时是有效的替代方案，为分类核函数选择提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Designing categorical kernels is a major challenge for Gaussian process
regression with continuous and categorical inputs. Despite previous studies, it
is difficult to identify a preferred method, either because the evaluation
metrics, the optimization procedure, or the datasets change depending on the
study. In particular, reproducible code is rarely available. The aim of this
paper is to provide a reproducible comparative study of all existing
categorical kernels on many of the test cases investigated so far. We also
propose new evaluation metrics inspired by the optimization community, which
provide quantitative rankings of the methods across several tasks. From our
results on datasets which exhibit a group structure on the levels of
categorical inputs, it appears that nested kernels methods clearly outperform
all competitors. When the group structure is unknown or when there is no prior
knowledge of such a structure, we propose a new clustering-based strategy using
target encodings of categorical variables. We show that on a large panel of
datasets, which do not necessarily have a known group structure, this
estimation strategy still outperforms other approaches while maintaining low
computational cost.

TL;DR: 本文研究不完全市场中复制投资组合构建问题，提出基于AlphaZero的系统，并与深度对冲方法比较，证明AlphaZero在非凸环境下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融工程中复制投资组合构建的关键问题，特别是在涉及非凸交易成本、资本约束等复杂市场环境下，现有深度对冲方法存在局限性。

Method: 将问题建模为投资者与市场的双人博弈，引入基于AlphaZero的系统，并与基于梯度下降的深度对冲方法进行对比。

Result: 深度对冲在Q函数不受凸性约束的环境中容易陷入局部最优，而AlphaZero始终能找到接近最优的复制策略，且样本效率更高。

Conclusion: AlphaZero在非凸市场环境中优于深度对冲，特别是在数据稀缺的衍生品市场中具有重要优势，同时建立了深度对冲与凸优化的理论联系。

Abstract: This paper examines replication portfolio construction in incomplete markets
- a key problem in financial engineering with applications in pricing, hedging,
balance sheet management, and energy storage planning. We model this as a
two-player game between an investor and the market, where the investor makes
strategic bets on future states while the market reveals outcomes. Inspired by
the success of Monte Carlo Tree Search in stochastic games, we introduce an
AlphaZero-based system and compare its performance to deep hedging - a widely
used industry method based on gradient descent. Through theoretical analysis
and experiments, we show that deep hedging struggles in environments where the
$Q$-function is not subject to convexity constraints - such as those involving
non-convex transaction costs, capital constraints, or regulatory limitations -
converging to local optima. We construct specific market environments to
highlight these limitations and demonstrate that AlphaZero consistently finds
near-optimal replication strategies. On the theoretical side, we establish a
connection between deep hedging and convex optimization, suggesting that its
effectiveness is contingent on convexity assumptions. Our experiments further
suggest that AlphaZero is more sample-efficient - an important advantage in
data-scarce, overfitting-prone derivative markets.

Method: 应用动力学平均场理论(DMFT)推导出高维梯度流动力学的低维有效过程，通过分析该有效过程来研究DLN的动力学特性。

Result: 获得了关于损失收敛率及其与泛化权衡的新见解，系统性地重现了先前观察到的多种现象，包括初始化依赖解和增量学习行为。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对DLNs的理解，并证明了DMFT方法在分析神经网络高维学习动力学方面的有效性。

Abstract: Diagonal linear networks (DLNs) are a tractable model that captures several
nontrivial behaviors in neural network training, such as
initialization-dependent solutions and incremental learning. These phenomena
are typically studied in isolation, leaving the overall dynamics insufficiently
understood. In this work, we present a unified analysis of various phenomena in
the gradient flow dynamics of DLNs. Using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT),
we derive a low-dimensional effective process that captures the asymptotic
gradient flow dynamics in high dimensions. Analyzing this effective process
yields new insights into DLN dynamics, including loss convergence rates and
their trade-off with generalization, and systematically reproduces many of the
previously observed phenomena. These findings deepen our understanding of DLNs
and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DMFT approach in analyzing
high-dimensional learning dynamics of neural networks.

Conclusion: 该方法为训练能量基模型提供了一种具有明确误差保证的新颖方法，通过连续时间公式实现了参数优化和密度采样的同步进行。

Abstract: We propose a continuous-time formulation of persistent contrastive divergence
(PCD) for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of unnormalised densities. Our
approach expresses PCD as a coupled, multiscale system of stochastic
differential equations (SDEs), which perform optimisation of the parameter and
sampling of the associated parametrised density, simultaneously.
  From this novel formulation, we are able to derive explicit bounds for the
error between the PCD iterates and the MLE solution for the model parameter.
This is made possible by deriving uniform-in-time (UiT) bounds for the
difference in moments between the multiscale system and the averaged regime. An
efficient implementation of the continuous-time scheme is introduced,
leveraging a class of explicit, stable intregators, stochastic orthogonal
Runge-Kutta Chebyshev (S-ROCK), for which we provide explicit error estimates
in the long-time regime. This leads to a novel method for training energy-based
models (EBMs) with explicit error guarantees.

Result: 实验结果表明Ad-SVGD在各种任务中始终优于标准启发式方法

Conclusion: 自适应核参数选择策略能够显著提升SVGD方法的性能和收敛性

Abstract: A central challenge in Bayesian inference is efficiently approximating
posterior distributions. Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a popular
variational inference method which transports a set of particles to approximate
a target distribution. The SVGD dynamics are governed by a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS) and are highly sensitive to the choice of the kernel
function, which directly influences both convergence and approximation quality.
The commonly used median heuristic offers a simple approach for setting kernel
bandwidths but lacks flexibility and often performs poorly, particularly in
high-dimensional settings. In this work, we propose an alternative strategy for
adaptively choosing kernel parameters over an abstract family of kernels.
Recent convergence analyses based on the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD)
suggest that optimizing the kernel parameters by maximizing the KSD can improve
performance. Building on this insight, we introduce Adaptive SVGD (Ad-SVGD), a
method that alternates between updating the particles via SVGD and adaptively
tuning kernel bandwidths through gradient ascent on the KSD. We provide a
simplified theoretical analysis that extends existing results on minimizing the
KSD for fixed kernels to our adaptive setting, showing convergence properties
for the maximal KSD over our kernel class. Our empirical results further
support this intuition: Ad-SVGD consistently outperforms standard heuristics in
a variety of tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of inverse covariance (also known as
precision matrix) estimation in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we
focus on two classes of estimators: linear shrinkage estimators with a target
proportional to the identity matrix, and estimators derived from data
augmentation (DA). Here, DA refers to the common practice of enriching a
dataset with artificial samples--typically generated via a generative model or
through random transformations of the original data--prior to model fitting.
For both classes of estimators, we derive estimators and provide concentration
bounds for their quadratic error. This allows for both method comparison and
hyperparameter tuning, such as selecting the optimal proportion of artificial
samples. On the technical side, our analysis relies on tools from random matrix
theory. We introduce a novel deterministic equivalent for generalized resolvent
matrices, accommodating dependent samples with specific structure. We support
our theoretical results with numerical experiments.

combining learned climate-permafrost relationships (60%) with physical
permafrost sensitivity models (40%, -10 pp/C). Under RCP8.5 forcing (+5C over
10 years), we project mean permafrost fraction decline of -20.3 pp (median:
-20.0 pp), with 51.5% of Arctic Russia experiencing over 20 percentage point
loss. Infrastructure risk classification identifies 15% high-risk zones (25%
medium-risk) with spatially explicit uncertainty maps. Our framework represents
the largest validated permafrost ML dataset globally, provides the first
operational hybrid physics-ML forecasting system for Arctic infrastructure, and
delivers open-source tools enabling probabilistic permafrost projections for
engineering design codes and climate adaptation planning. The methodology is
generalizable to other permafrost regions and demonstrates how hybrid
approaches can overcome pure data-driven limitations in climate change
applications.
