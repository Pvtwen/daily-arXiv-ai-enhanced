We also show that the Zak-OTFS\nde-modulator with matched filtering constrained to sinc filtering (filter\nbandwidth $B$) followed by rectangular time windowing over duration $T$ can be\nimplemented as a low-complexity post-processing of the CP-OFDM de-modulator\noutput. This proposed ``Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM\" architecture enables us to\nharness the benefits of Zak-OTFS in existing network infrastructure. We also\nshow that the proposed Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM is a family of modulations, with\nCP-OFDM being a special case when the delay period takes its minimum possible\nvalue equal to the inverse bandwidth, i.e., Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM with minimum\ndelay period.", "AI": {"tldr": "Zak-OTFS\u8c03\u5236\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u5ef6\u8fdf/\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u6269\u5c55\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eCP-OFDM\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0Zak-OTFS\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u73b0\u6709CP-OFDM\u8c03\u5236\u89e3\u8c03\u5668\u4e2d\u652f\u6301Zak-OTFS\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7sinc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5c06Zak-OTFS\u8c03\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3aCP-OFDM\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u8c03\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3aCP-OFDM\u89e3\u8c03\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM\u67b6\u6784\uff0cCP-OFDM\u662f\u5176\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5468\u671f\u53d6\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u65f6\u7684\u7279\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\u5229\u7528Zak-OTFS\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of\nreasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to\nenhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing\nmultimodal models predominantly rely on \"one-time\" diagnostic approaches,\nlacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to\nchallenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse\nrewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose\nCX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved \"think-answer\"\nreasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and\nverifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an\ninstruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148\nsamples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points\nsupervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under\nthe Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic\nreasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain\ndiagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the\nneed for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain\nMLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment,\nachieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable\nCXR-specific models.

Experiments conducted on Llama-2 and Mistral show even\nwith the number of simultaneous edits reaching 10,000, LKS effectively performs\nknowledge editing while preserving the general abilities of the edited LLMs.\nCode is available at: https://github.com/Linuxin-xxx/LKS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLatent Knowledge Scalpel (LKS)\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u7f16\u8f91\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cbe\u786e\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6216\u8fc7\u65f6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u7f16\u8f91\u5927\u91cf\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91LLMs\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7f16\u8f91\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u66ff\u6362\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165LKS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u64cd\u4f5c\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama-2\u548cMistral\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u540c\u65f6\u7f16\u8f91\u6570\u91cf\u8fbe\u523010,000\uff0cLKS\u4ecd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LKS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7f16\u8f91\u3002"}}

Traditional numerical solvers offer high accuracy, but suffer from\nscalability issues and substantial computational costs. Pure data-driven deep\nlearning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding\nduring training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their\napplicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nU-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully\ndeep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational\nEM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational\nefficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers\nand the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the\ndecomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a\nmultiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a\nphysics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-\nand mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)\nobjects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering\nmodeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.\nExperimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface\ncurrent distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while\nsignificantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep\nlearning baselines in both accuracy and robustness.

Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains\nchallenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a\ncomplex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of\nsoil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts\nagricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate\nresilience. In this work, we propose $\\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal\nmultitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized\npipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first\npredict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.\nEach segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological\nfeatures. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal\nconcatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to\naccount for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons.

To address this\nchallenge, we construct a spectral efficiency-aware codebook design framework\nthat explicitly incorporates the codebook activation probability into the\noptimization process.

We propose a novel RL framework to study and support\ndecision-making in T1DM technologies, such as automated insulin delivery. Our\napproach captures the complex temporal dynamics of treatment by unifying two\ncontrol modalities: \\textit{impulse control} for discrete, fast-acting\ninterventions (e.g., insulin boluses), and \\textit{switching control} for\nlonger-acting treatments and regime shifts.

We attribute this difference to an\nimproved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the\nsampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of\ntransfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets\nand find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail\noff as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off\nin performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good\njob of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points\ntowards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when\nthese less useful points are eventually added.

We propose a combined manifold and machine\nlearning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent\ncrowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The\nproposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation\nEquation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and\nmultiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the\nmass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first\nstep, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete\nmicroscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based\non manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space\ninto the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the\ncorresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning\nreduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning\ntechniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the\ncrowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density\nprofiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density\ndistribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this \"embed->learn in latent\nspace->lift back to the ambient space\" pipeline, we create an effective\nsolution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.\nFor our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a\ncorridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions.

In recent years, multi-view clustering has attracted increasing\nattention due to its ability to integrate complementary information from\nmultiple views. However, existing methods primarily focus on clustering\nperformance, while fairness-a critical concern in human-centered\napplications-has been largely overlooked. Although recent studies have explored\ngroup fairness in multi-view clustering, most methods impose explicit\nregularization on cluster assignments, relying on the alignment between\nsensitive attributes and the underlying cluster structure. However, this\nassumption often fails in practice and can degrade clustering performance. In\nthis paper, we propose an adversarial fair multi-view clustering (AFMVC)\nframework that integrates fairness learning into the representation learning\nprocess.

However, a common challenge observed across\nmany replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses\nunder a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or\nincorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero.

Transformer-based models and large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their ability to capture\nlong-range dependencies and patterns. However, current methods often rely on\nrigid inductive biases, ignore intervariable interactions, or apply static\nfusion strategies that limit adaptability across forecast horizons. These\nlimitations create bottlenecks in capturing nuanced, horizon-specific\nrelationships in time-series data.

We propose PrivDFS, a new paradigm\nfor private inference that replaces a single exposed representation with\ndistributed feature sharing. PrivDFS partitions input features on the client\ninto multiple balanced shares, which are distributed to non-colluding,\nnon-communicating servers for independent partial inference. The client\nsecurely aggregates the servers' outputs to reconstruct the final prediction,\nensuring that no single server observes sufficient information to compromise\ninput privacy. To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions:\nPrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy\nattacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD,\nwhich leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and\nprevent query-based inversion generalization.

To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized\nhigh-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8\nrepresentations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing\nthe lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA models show FlexQ\nmaintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.05.\nThe proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on\nLLaMA-2-70B linear layers. End-to-end, FlexQ delivers 1.33$\\times$ inference\nacceleration and 1.21$\\times$ memory savings over SmoothQuant.

Parallel to this\nprogress, the demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has spurred\na growing body of research aimed at interpreting the complex decision-making\nprocesses of these models. This systematic literature review analyzes research\npublished between January 2020 and early 2024 that focuses on the\nexplainability of multimodal models. Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we\nexamine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model\narchitecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation\nmethodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are\nconcentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based\ntechniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these\nmethods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between\nmodalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity\nacross domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in\nmultimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency,\nrobustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual\nfactors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of\nrecommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized\nevaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research.

We identify that the root issue lies in\nthe long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently\nsensitive to non-IID data.

The results\nshow that our approach effectively answers the core question: Can the\ndisclosure of a given identity attribute possibly lead to the disclosure of\nanother attribute?", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67905000\u591a\u4e2a\u8eab\u4efd\u76d7\u7a83\u548c\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u4eba\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2a\u4eba\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8eab\u4efd\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u8bba\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u67d0\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u9732\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u4ed6\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

First, we train a structural GFM by predicting\ngraph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend\nonly on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the\ngraph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract\nstructural information and provide discriminative graph representations\ncomparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the\nrepresentations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a\ncomprehensive GFM.

A major challenge is the integration of real-world data\ninto the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we\nintroduce two novel training strategies.

We also implement a\ncustom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to\ncounteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we\nintroduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via\na look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure\nphysically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model\nwas selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.

While\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced LP performance\nrecently, existing methods face key challenges including limited supervision\nfrom sparse connectivity, sensitivity to initialization, and poor\ngeneralization under distribution shifts. We explore pretraining as a solution\nto address these challenges. Unlike node classification, LP is inherently a\npairwise task, which requires the integration of both node- and edge-level\ninformation. In this work, we present the first systematic study on the\ntransferability of these distinct modules and propose a late fusion strategy to\neffectively combine their outputs for improved performance. To handle the\ndiversity of pretraining data and avoid negative transfer, we introduce a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that captures distinct patterns in separate\nexperts, facilitating seamless application of the pretrained model on diverse\ndownstream datasets. For fast adaptation, we develop a parameter-efficient\ntuning strategy that allows the pretrained model to adapt to unseen datasets\nwith minimal computational overhead.
