We model the uncertainty that the learner faces by a\ndistribution $\\pi$ in the ground-truth triples $(p, q, f)$ -- which we call a\nUDA class -- where $(p, q)$ is the source -- target distribution pair and $f$\nis the classifier. We define the performance of a learner as the overall target\ndomain risk, averaged over the randomness of the ground-truth triple. This\nformulation couples the source distribution, the target distribution and the\nclassifier in the ground truth, and deviates from the classical worst-case\nanalyses, which pessimistically emphasize the impact of hard but rare UDA\ninstances. In this formulation, we precisely characterize the optimal learner.\nThe performance of the optimal learner then allows us to define the learning\ndifficulty for the UDA class and for the observed sample. To quantify this\ndifficulty, we introduce an information-theoretic quantity -- Posterior Target\nLabel Uncertainty (PTLU) -- along with its empirical estimate (EPTLU) from the\nsample , which capture the uncertainty in the prediction for the target domain.\nBriefly, PTLU is the entropy of the predicted label in the target domain under\nthe posterior distribution of ground-truth classifier given the observed source\nand target samples. By proving that such a quantity serves to lower-bound the\nrisk of any learner, we suggest that these quantities can be used as proxies\nfor evaluating the hardness of UDA learning. We provide several examples to\ndemonstrate the advantage of PTLU, relative to the existing measures, in\nevaluating the difficulty of UDA learning."}

Although existing\nmodels achieve some success, they rarely both model time and frequency\ncharacteristics in a pretraining-finetuning paradigm leading to suboptimal\nperformance in predictions of complex time series, which requires both modeling\nperiodicity and prior pattern knowledge of signals. We propose MoFE-Time, an\ninnovative time series forecasting model that integrates time and frequency\ndomain features within a Mixture of Experts (MoE) network. Moreover, we use the\npretraining-finetuning paradigm as our training framework to effectively\ntransfer prior pattern knowledge across pretraining and finetuning datasets\nwith different periodicity distributions. Our method introduces both frequency\nand time cells as experts after attention modules and leverages the MoE routing\nmechanism to construct multidimensional sparse representations of input\nsignals. In experiments on six public benchmarks, MoFE-Time has achieved new\nstate-of-the-art performance, reducing MSE and MAE by 6.95% and 6.02% compared\nto the representative methods Time-MoE. Beyond the existing evaluation\nbenchmarks, we have developed a proprietary dataset, NEV-sales, derived from\nreal-world business scenarios. Our method achieves outstanding results on this\ndataset, underscoring the effectiveness of the MoFE-Time model in practical\ncommercial applications."}

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a\npromising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state\nforecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor\nnetworks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate\ninformation across the network.

In insurance industries\n(\\cite{parodi2023pricing}), assessing the range of possible claim costs for\nindividual drivers improves premium pricing accuracy. It also enables insurers\nto manage risk more effectively by accounting for uncertainty in accident\nlikelihood and severity. In the presence of covariates, a variety of\nregression-type models are often used for modeling insurance claims, ranging\nfrom relatively simple generalized linear models (GLMs) to regularized GLMs to\ngradient boosting models (GBMs). Conformal predictive inference has arisen as a\npopular distribution-free approach for quantifying predictive uncertainty under\nrelatively weak assumptions of exchangeability, and has been well studied under\nthe classic linear regression setting. In this work, we propose new\nnon-conformity measures for GLMs and GBMs with GLM-type loss. Using regularized\nTweedie GLM regression and LightGBM with Tweedie loss, we demonstrate conformal\nprediction performance with these non-conformity measures in insurance claims\ndata. Our simulation results favor the use of locally weighted Pearson\nresiduals for LightGBM over other methods considered, as the resulting\nintervals maintained the nominal coverage with the smallest average width."}

In real-world\napplications, however, logged data often suffers from missingness. While OPE\nhas been extensively studied in the literature, a theoretical understanding of\nhow missing data affects OPE results remains unclear. In this paper, we\ninvestigate OPE in the presence of monotone missingness and theoretically\ndemonstrate that the value estimates remain unbiased under ignorable\nmissingness but can be biased under nonignorable (informative) missingness. To\nretain the consistency of value estimation, we propose an inverse probability\nweighted value estimator and conduct statistical inference to quantify the\nuncertainty of the estimates. Through a series of numerical experiments, we\nempirically demonstrate that our proposed estimator yields a more reliable\nvalue inference under missing data."}

Tashman", "Soumaya Cherkaoui", "Walaa Hamouda"], "title": "Federated Learning-based MARL for Strengthening Physical-Layer Security in B5G Networks", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper explores the application of a federated learning-based multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) strategy to enhance physical-layer security (PLS)\nin a multi-cellular network within the context of beyond 5G networks. At each\ncell, a base station (BS) operates as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent\nthat interacts with the surrounding environment to maximize the secrecy rate of\nlegitimate users in the presence of an eavesdropper. This eavesdropper attempts\nto intercept the confidential information shared between the BS and its\nauthorized users. The DRL agents are deemed to be federated since they only\nshare their network parameters with a central server and not the private data\nof their legitimate users. Two DRL approaches, deep Q-network (DQN) and\nReinforce deep policy gradient (RDPG), are explored and compared. The results\ndemonstrate that RDPG converges more rapidly than DQN. In addition, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the distributed DRL approach.\nFurthermore, the outcomes illustrate the trade-off between security and\ncomplexity."}

Real data\ncollection is expensive, and available datasets often fail to capture the\nunique operational conditions and contextual variability of the network\nenvironment. Digital twinning provides a potential solution to this problem, as\nsimulators tailored to the current network deployment can generate\nsite-specific data to augment the available training datasets. However, there\nis a need to develop solutions to bridge the inherent simulation-to-reality\n(sim-to-real) gap between synthetic and real-world data. This paper reviews\nrecent advances on two complementary strategies: 1) the calibration of digital\ntwins (DTs) through real-world measurements, and 2) the use of sim-to-real\ngap-aware training strategies to robustly handle residual discrepancies between\ndigital twin-generated and real data. For the latter, we evaluate two\nconceptually distinct methods that model the sim-to-real gap either at the\nlevel of the environment via Bayesian learning or at the level of the training\nloss via prediction-powered inference."}
