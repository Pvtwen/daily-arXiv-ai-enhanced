### [1] [Three-Dimensional Millimeter-Wave Imaging Using Active Incoherent Fourier Processing and Pulse Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07239)
*Jorge R. Colon-Berrios,Jason M. Merlo,Jeffrey A. Nanzer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合二维空间傅里叶域成像技术和雷达脉冲压缩的三维成像方法，通过噪声信号和LFM信号的联合处理实现高分辨率三维重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成像技术难以同时实现高分辨率的三维成像，因此需要一种新的方法结合空间傅里叶域和脉冲压缩技术来解决这一问题。

Method: 使用四个发射器，其中三个发射空间和时间不相干的噪声信号，第四个发射已知的LFM脉冲信号，通过干涉处理和高分辨率匹配滤波实现三维成像。

Result: 通过仿真和实验数据验证了该技术能够重建目标的三维图像。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了噪声信号和LFM信号的优势，实现了高分辨率的三维成像。

Abstract: We present a novel three-dimensional (3D) imaging approach that combines
two-dimensional spatial Fourier-domain imaging techniques with traditional
radar pulse compression to recover both cross-range and down-range scene
information. The imaging system employs four transmitters, three of which emit
spatially and temporally incoherent noise signals, while the fourth transmits a
known linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulsed signal. The spatial incoherence
of the noise signals enables sampling of the 2D spatial Fourier spectrum of the
scene from which two-dimensional cross-range (azimuth and elevation) images can
be formed via interferometric processing. Simultaneously, the LFM signal
enables high-resolution downrange imaging through matched filtering. The
received signals consist of a superposition of the noise sources and the known
pulse allowing for joint recovery of all three dimensions. We describe the
system architecture and waveform design, and demonstrate the imaging technique
using both simulations with a linear array and experimental data from a 38 GHz
active incoherent millimeter-wave imaging system with 23-element randomized
array. Results show the reconstruction of targets in three dimensions.

### [2] [A RIS-Enabled Computational Radar Coincidence Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07285)
*Kavian Zirak,Mohammadreza F. Imani*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合可重构智能表面（RIS）、雷达重合成像（RCI）和计算成像的创新成像方法，通过定向波束形成空间多样散斑图案，提高信噪比并减少杂波。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成像方法如光栅扫描需要大量测量，而计算成像通常依赖随机图案，信噪比低。本文旨在结合两者的优势，提出一种高效、高质量的成像方法。

Method: 利用RIS同时定向波束到感兴趣区域，形成空间多样散斑图案，结合RCI和计算成像技术，减少测量次数并提高成像质量。

Result: 数值模拟表明，该方法在少量测量下仍能获得高质量图像，信噪比高且杂波少。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于安全筛查、无线用户跟踪和活动识别，展示了高效成像的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative imaging method using reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) by combining radar coincidence imaging (RCI) and
computational imaging techniques. In the proposed framework, RISs
simultaneously redirect beams toward a desired region of interest (ROI). The
interference of these beams forms spatially diverse speckle patterns that carry
information about the entire ROI. As a result, this method can take advantage
of the benefits of both random patterns and spotlight imaging. Since the
speckle pattern is formed by directive beams (instead of random patterns
typically used in computational imaging), this approach results in a higher
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduced clutter. In contrast to raster
scanning, which requires the number of measurements to be at least equal to the
number of unknowns, our proposed approach follows a computational imaging
framework and can obtain high-quality images even when only a few measurements
are taken. Using numerical simulation, we demonstrate this method's
capabilities and contrast it against other conventional techniques. The
proposed imaging approach can be applied to security screening, wireless user
tracking, and activity recognition.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于毫米波雷达提取人群运动模式并推断语义的新框架，结合信号处理和几何图分析，实现了高保真的人群流场重建和语义推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过毫米波雷达技术解决复杂人群运动模式的提取和语义推断问题，为人群分析提供新工具。

Method: 结合光学流估计与噪声过滤生成高保真流场，将其转化为有向几何图，并通过雅可比矩阵分析提取语义。

Result: 在21次实验中，框架成功重建复杂人群流场结构，并准确推断出人群语义（如转向、分散等）。

Conclusion: 验证了框架的有效性，展示了其在人群分析应用中的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for extracting underlying crowd
motion patterns and inferring crowd semantics using mmWave radar. First, our
proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts
from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering to
generate high-fidelity mmWave flow fields - compact 2D vector representations
of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these
fields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow
currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is
quantified across edges. Finally, we show that by analyzing the local Jacobian
and computing the corresponding curl and divergence, we can extract key crowd
semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on
crowds of up to (and including) 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity
mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the
underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating
strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow
split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key
crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift,
dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate our framework,
underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.

### [4] [Featureless Wireless Communications using Enhanced Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07474)
*Ruhui Zhang,Wei Lin,Binbin Chen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自动编码器（AE）的无线通信系统，通过改进损失函数和输入编码方式，生成低检测/拦截概率（LPD/LPI）的无特征信号，同时降低块错误率（BLER）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用AE生成无特征信号以实现安全可靠的无线通信，解决传统方法在LPD/LPI和BLER性能上的不足。

Method: 1. 引入包含KL散度项的损失函数，增强信号的噪声特性；2. 用二进制输入替代独热编码，结合传统纠错编码方案支持长源消息块。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法显著提升了信号的无特征性，并降低了BLER，验证了其在无线通信中的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于AE的方法在安全性和可靠性方面表现出色，为无线通信系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly autoencoders (AEs),
have gained significant attention in wireless communication systems. This paper
investigates using an AE to generate featureless signals with a low probability
of detection and interception (LPD/LPI). Firstly, we introduce a novel loss
function that adds a KL divergence term to the categorical cross entropy,
enhancing the noise like characteristics of AE-generated signals while
preserving block error rate (BLER). Secondly, to support long source message
blocks for the AE's inputs, we replace one-hot inputs of source blocks with
binary inputs pre-encoded by conventional error correction coding schemes. The
AE's outputs are then decoded back to the source blocks using the same scheme.
This design enables the AE to learn the coding structure, yielding superior
BLER performance on coded blocks and the BLER of the source blocks is further
decreased by the error correction decoder. Moreover, we also validate the AE
based communication system in the over-the-air communication. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed methods improve the featureless
properties of AE signals and significantly reduce the BLER of message blocks,
underscoring the promise of our AE-based approach for secure and reliable
wireless communication systems.

### [5] [Leveraging Power Amplifier Distortion for Physical Layer Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07567)
*Reza Ghasemi Alavicheh,Thomas Feys,MD Arifur Rahman,François Rottenberg*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用功率放大器非线性失真的物理层安全新方法，通过Z3RO预编码器将失真导向非用户位置，提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理层安全技术依赖人工噪声，而本文探索了功率放大器非线性失真的潜在安全价值。

Method: 采用Z3RO预编码器，通过多天线负极性抵消用户位置的失真，将失真导向非用户位置干扰窃听者。

Result: 数值模拟显示，Z3RO预编码器在特定条件下比传统MRT预编码器保密率提升2.5倍。

Conclusion: 功率放大器的非线性特性可被有效利用以增强物理层安全性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to physical layer security (PLS) by
leveraging power amplifier (PA) nonlinear distortion through distortion-aware
precoding. While some conventional PLS techniques inject artificial noise
orthogonal to legitimate channels, we demonstrate that inherent PA
nonlinearities typically considered undesirable can be exploited to enhance
security. The zero 3rd order (Z3RO) precoder applies a negative polarity to
several antennas to cancel the PA distortion at the user location, resulting in
distortion being transmitted in non-user locations. Redirecting the distortion
to non-user locations creates interference for potential eavesdroppers,
lowering their signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR). Numerical
simulations reveal that the Z3RO precoder achieves up to a $2.5\times$
improvement in secrecy rate compared to conventional maximum ratio transmission
(MRT) precoding under a $10\%$ outage probability, SNR of $32$ dB and $-5$ dB
input back-off (IBO) where the PAs enter the saturation regime.

### [6] [RIS-assisted ISAC Systems for Industrial Revolution 6.0: Exploring the Near-field and Far-field Coexistence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07643)
*Seonghoon Yoo,Jaemin Jung,Seongah Jeong,Jinkyu Kang,Markku Juntti,Joonhyuk Kang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了RIS辅助的ISAC系统在IIoT中的应用，结合近场和远场区域，优化了频谱效率与感知精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现工业6.0愿景需要无缝集成多样化设备，ISAC在IIoT实时控制与自动化中起关键作用。

Method: 采用RIS辅助的ISAC系统，结合SO和ISAC频段，利用NOMA技术，通过SCA-AO和SDR方法联合优化RIS相移、带宽分配和波束成形。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提方法在RIS和设备配置中显著优于传统方法，确保近场和远场共存场景下的稳健性能。

Conclusion: RIS辅助的ISAC系统在IIoT中具有显著优势，为未来工业自动化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has emerged as a key technology for
realizing the vision of Industry 6.0, requiring the seamless integration of
diverse connected devices. In particular, integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) plays a critical role in supporting real-time control and automation
within IIoT systems. In this paper, we explore reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS)-assisted ISAC systems for IIoT in the coexistence of near-field
and far-field regions. The system consists of a full-duplex access point (AP),
a RIS and multiple IIoT devices, where the near-field devices simultaneously
perform sensing and communication, while the far-field devices rely on a
RIS-assisted communication. To enhance spectral efficiency for both sensing and
communication functionalities, we consider the use of both traditional
sensing-only (SO) and ISAC frequency bands. Moreover, uplink non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) is employed to facilitate the sequential decoding of
superimposed communication and sensing signals from IIoT devices. To maximize
sensing accuracy in terms of Cram${\Grave{\textrm{e}}}$r-Rao bound (CRB), we
formulate a joint optimization of RIS phase shift, bandwidth splitting ratio
and receive beamforming vector subject to the minimum data rate requirements of
IIoT devices and resource budget constraints. The algorithmic solution is
developed via the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based alternating
optimization (AO) method with the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms conventional methods relying solely on either ISAC or SO band by
achieving superior performance across RIS and device configurations, while
ensuring robust ISAC performance under the near-field and far-field coexistence
scenarios.

### [7] [Consistent and Asymptotically Efficient Localization from Bearing-only Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07647)
*Shenghua Hu,Guangyang Zeng,Wenchao Xue,Haitao Fang,Biqiang Mu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两步估计器，用于解决基于方位测量的信号源定位问题，具有低计算复杂度和与最大似然估计器相同的渐近性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基于方位测量的信号源定位问题，解决最大似然估计器因非凸优化问题而难以计算的问题。

Method: 提出两步估计器：第一步通过代数操作构建线性最小二乘问题，获得初步一致估计器；第二步执行单次高斯-牛顿迭代，达到与最大似然估计器相同的渐近性能。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的两步估计器在大样本量下表现优越。

Conclusion: 两步估计器在计算复杂度和性能上均优于传统方法，适用于大规模信号源定位问题。

Abstract: We study the problem of signal source localization using bearing-only
measurements. Initially, we present easily verifiable geometric conditions for
sensor deployment to ensure the asymptotic identifiability of the model and
demonstrate the consistency and asymptotic efficiency of the maximum likelihood
(ML) estimator. However, obtaining the ML estimator is challenging due to its
association with a non-convex optimization problem. To address this, we propose
a two-step estimator that shares the same asymptotic properties as the ML
estimator while offering low computational complexity, linear in the number of
measurements. The primary challenge lies in obtaining a preliminary consistent
estimator in the first step. To achieve this, we construct a linear
least-squares problem through algebraic operations on the measurement nonlinear
model to first obtain a biased closed-form solution. We then eliminate the bias
using the data to yield an asymptotically unbiased and consistent estimator.
The key to this process is obtaining a consistent estimator of the variance of
the sine of the noise by taking the reciprocal of the maximum eigenvalue of a
specially constructed matrix from the data. In the second step, we perform a
single Gauss-Newton iteration using the preliminary consistent estimator as the
initial value, achieving the same asymptotic properties as the ML estimator.
Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed two-step estimator for large sample sizes.

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了延迟要求，提升了触觉互联网的可靠性。

Abstract: Tactile Internet (TI) requires achieving ultra-low latency and highly
reliable packet delivery for haptic signals. In the presence of packet loss and
delay, the signal prediction method provides a viable solution for recovering
the missing signals. To this end, we introduce the Leader-Follower (LeFo)
approach based on a cooperative Stackelberg game, which enables both users and
robots to learn and predict actions. With accurate prediction, the
teleoperation system can safely relax its strict delay requirements. Our method
achieves high prediction accuracy, ranging from 80.62% to 95.03% for remote
robot signals at the Human ($H$) side and from 70.44% to 89.77% for human
operation signals at the remote Robot ($R$) side. We also establish an upper
bound for maximum signal loss using Taylor Expansion, ensuring robustness.

Conclusion: FBS方法为大规模海上风电场提供了有效的实时通信解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable and low-latency communication in offshore wind farms is
critical for efficient monitoring and control, yet remains challenging due to
the harsh environment and lack of infrastructure. This paper investigates a
flying base station (FBS) approach for wide-area monitoring and control in the
UK Hornsea offshore wind farm project. By leveraging mobile, flexible FBS
platforms in the remote and harsh offshore environment, the proposed system
offers real-time connectivity for turbines without the need for deploying
permanent infrastructure at the sea. We develop a detailed and practical
end-to-end latency model accounting for five key factors: flight duration,
connection establishment, turbine state information upload, computational
delay, and control transmission, to provide a holistic perspective often
missing in prior studies. Furthermore, we combine trajectory planning,
beamforming, and resource allocation into a multi-objective optimization
framework for the overall latency minimization, specifically designed for
large-scale offshore wind farm deployments. Simulation results verify the
effectiveness of our proposed method in minimizing latency and enhancing
efficiency in FBS-assisted offshore monitoring across various power levels,
while consistently outperforming baseline designs.

### [10] [Real-Time Decorrelation-Based Anomaly Detection for Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07559)
*Amirhossein Sadough,Mahyar Shahsavari,Mark Wijtvliet,Marcel van Gerven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAD是一种基于在线去相关学习的实时异常检测方法，适用于多变量时间序列，具有高效性和内存节省的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工业物联网的发展，实时异常检测需求激增，传统方法难以处理高维流数据且需存储历史数据，DAD旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DAD通过动态学习数据的相关性结构，单次处理样本，无需存储历史数据，并引入超参数调优策略。

Result: 实验表明，DAD在多种异常类型上表现优于现有方法，尤其适合高维实时数据流。

Conclusion: DAD在检测效果与计算效率间取得平衡，为实时、内存受限的异常检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

Conclusion: FACap数据集和FashionBLIP-2模型在时尚领域图像检索任务中表现出色，适用于高要求的电商环境。

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间动态表示在非线性系统识别中常用，但训练中状态轨迹可能严重变形，导致数据覆盖不足，影响训练算法、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 引入基于数据分布的惩罚项，提出两种正则化技术，用于局部仿射状态空间模型的状态轨迹数据点分布。

Result: 在广泛使用的系统识别基准上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法通过优化数据分布，改善了训练效果和模型的可解释性。

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

*Francesco Ferrini,Veronica Lachi,Antonio Longa,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SP4LP结合GNN和最短路径序列建模，高效捕捉多跳依赖关系，提升链接预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN方法难以捕捉链接特定的结构模式，且现有方法计算成本高或过于简化。

Method: SP4LP通过GNN生成节点表示，提取最短路径并用序列模型处理，捕捉多跳关系。

Result: SP4LP在链接预测基准测试中达到最优性能，理论证明其表达能力更强。

Conclusion: SP4LP是一种高效且通用的链接预测方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

Motivation: 探索稀疏适配器作为参数高效模块化架构的构建块，以快速适应下游任务而无需额外微调。

Method: 提出了一种简单的稀疏适配器训练方法，并研究了其在多任务合并中的性能。

Result: 稀疏适配器在多任务合并中表现出优于LoRA和全微调的性能，但在泛化性能上仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 稀疏适配器是模块化架构的有效构建块，但其泛化性能仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Str-GCL的新框架，通过一阶逻辑规则明确整合结构常识到图对比学习中，提升了表示学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图对比学习方法主要关注隐式语义关系，忽视了图中结构常识的重要性，导致表示学习效果受限。

Method: Str-GCL利用一阶逻辑规则表示结构常识，并通过表示对齐机制将其整合到GCL框架中，无需修改原始图。

Result: 实验表明，Str-GCL优于现有GCL方法，为图表示学习提供了新视角。

Conclusion: Str-GCL首次将结构常识直接引入GCL，为图表示学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

Motivation: 通过多模态学习提升食物摄入手势检测的准确性，并解决模态缺失时的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 提出MM-TCN-CMA框架，整合IMU和雷达数据，利用跨模态注意力机制增强检测性能。

Result: 在多模态条件下，F1分数分别比单模态雷达和IMU模型提高4.3%和5.2%；在缺失模态时仍有1.3%和2.4%的提升。

Conclusion: 该框架首次成功融合IMU和雷达数据，显著提升了食物摄入手势检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解特征对预测的贡献是机器学习模型的重要需求，但置换特征重要性在特征依赖时可能误导。

Method: 开发TRIP测试，检测不可靠的置换特征重要性分数，并扩展至高维场景。

Result: 测试在模拟数据和实际应用中能可靠检测不可靠的置换特征重要性分数。

Conclusion: TRIP测试为置换特征重要性提供了可靠性验证工具。

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

Motivation: 传统流行病学模型和神经网络方法难以完全捕捉现实网络中的非线性反馈机制，因此需要更有效的建模方法。

Method: 评估了三种方法：经典ODE、UDEs和Neural ODEs，并引入符号恢复方法将神经反馈转化为显式数学表达式。

Result: UDEs方法显著降低了预测误差，揭示了网络饱和、安全响应和恶意软件变种演化等抑制机制。

Conclusion: 混合物理信息模型在预测准确性和动态洞察力上优于纯解析和纯神经网络方法，支持早期预警系统和针对性防御策略的开发。

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

TL;DR: GO-CBED是一个目标导向的贝叶斯框架，用于序列因果实验设计，直接最大化用户指定因果量的信息增益，比传统方法更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法旨在推断完整的因果模型，而GO-CBED专注于用户感兴趣的因果量，提高实验的针对性和效率。

Method: 通过变分下界估计器和基于Transformer的策略网络，结合归一化流变分后验，实现实时决策。

Result: 在多种因果推理和发现任务中，GO-CBED表现优于基线方法，尤其在实验预算有限和复杂因果机制的情况下。

Conclusion: GO-CBED通过目标导向和前瞻性序列规划，显著提升了实验设计的效率。

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM规模的快速扩大，推理成本高昂，部署难度增加。现有量化方法在低于3位时面临精度和效率问题，亟需一种高效低比特量化方案。

Method: CCQ结合卷积码、混合编码和码簇技术，构建无查找表的编码空间，实现权重向量与码本的线性映射，优化推理性能。

Result: 实验表明，CCQ在多个基准测试中表现优异，成功将DeepSeek-V3和ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B压缩至184GB和89GB，支持单GPU部署。

Conclusion: CCQ为LLM提供了一种高效的低比特量化解决方案，显著降低了部署成本，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B
model and inference engine have been open-sourced.

Abstract: Learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data poses a
persistent challenge in statistical learning. In this study, we introduce
data-dependent Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in
Hilbert space. Our inequalities apply to both stationary and non-stationary
processes and exploit the potential rapid decay of correlations between
temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the
utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems,
achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to
illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

Motivation: LLMs易受多轮越狱攻击，传统方法难以检测和缓解，需创新防御手段。

Method: 提出G-Guard，构建实体图捕捉多轮查询关系，引入注意力增强机制提升分类能力。

Result: G-Guard在所有数据集和指标上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: G-Guard有效防御多轮越狱攻击，为LLM安全提供新解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

Conclusion: 模型弹性可作为评估预训练模型在数据驱动决策中集成效果的基本指标，具有广泛实用价值。

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

Result: 在11个识别数据集上取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: DeMul方法通过描述无关的多提示学习，显著提升了性能与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results

Result: 实验表明，CGFM在时间序列预测任务中优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: CGFM通过利用辅助模型的误差信息和扩展概率路径空间，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

Motivation: 在离线到在线强化学习中，如何利用离线数据提升在线学习的样本效率和探索能力是关键挑战。

Method: Q-chunking将动作分块技术应用于基于时间差分（TD）的强化学习方法，通过在分块动作空间中直接运行RL，利用离线数据中的时间一致性行为进行更有效的探索，并使用无偏的n步备份提升TD学习的稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，Q-chunking在离线性能和在线样本效率上表现优异，优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: Q-chunking为长视野稀疏奖励任务提供了一种简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

Conclusion: 组合泛化能力与数据和模型规模相关，且可通过线性解码隐藏激活来验证，这一发现解释了文本到图像生成模型在组合已知概念时的失败。

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

Result: DeCoLe在仇恨言论检测中表现优异，优于其他标签错误检测方法。

Conclusion: DeCoLe为标签偏差感知的错误检测提供了有效工具，可提升数据可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

Result: 实验表明，学习的奇异子空间在下游任务（如特征分析和多步预测）中可靠且有效。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了现有技术的局限性，为学习Koopman算子的奇异函数提供了一种更稳定和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

Motivation: LLMs在不同输入下表现不一致，表明其存在不确定性，尤其在关键场景中需要量化这种不确定性。现有研究多关注单一模型，忽略了模型多样性的潜力。

Method: 提出MUSE方法，利用Jensen-Shannon Divergence识别并集成校准良好的LLMs子集，以提升不确定性估计的可靠性。

Result: 在二元预测任务中，MUSE在校准和预测性能上优于单模型和简单集成基线。

Conclusion: 模型多样性对LLMs不确定性量化具有潜力，MUSE通过子集集成实现了更可靠的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型和视觉语言模型规模扩大，注意力机制成为计算瓶颈，缺乏对其能源和硬件资源需求的严格评估。

Method: 在GPT-2架构上对八种注意力机制进行基准测试，测量训练时间、GPU内存使用、FLOPS、CPU使用和功耗等关键指标。

Result: 优化的注意力机制（如Flash Attention、LSH Attention和MLA）能效最佳；GPU功耗降低不一定减少总能耗，训练时间同样重要。

Conclusion: 研究强调了能源感知评估在注意力设计中的重要性，为选择资源高效机制提供了实用见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

Conclusion: 研究强调了在安全分布式深度学习系统设计中考虑中间特征泄露的紧迫性。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

Result: 方法能够准确、可解释且可编辑地建模治疗动态，支持严格的因果分析和实际决策。

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险领域提供了可验证、稳健且可解释的治疗效果动态建模方法。

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

Conclusion: ProbNES通过整合贝叶斯方法显著提升了样本效率和性能，适用于多种优化场景。

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model

non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL

Conclusion: DPVD-MARL有效优化了CFL性能，提升了收敛速度和奖励。

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，通过微调LLMs（如Magistral Small模型）和创建双领域数据集，解决LLMs在化学领域生成科学合理但事实错误信息的问题。结果显示模型在格式、化学有效性和合成可行性方面有显著提升，但仍存在立体化学错误等局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在专业领域（如化学）中生成的‘合理性-有效性差距’问题，即信息科学合理但事实错误。

Method: 使用Magistral Small模型，通过LoRA微调，并创建双领域数据集（涵盖分子属性和化学反应），标准化数据质量。

Result: 微调模型在格式、化学有效性和合成可行性方面优于基线模型，但与人类专家相比仍存在立体化学错误等局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为将通用LLMs转化为可靠的化学研究工具提供了可行框架，并指出了未来改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but
factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级的黎曼混合专家层，将节点投影到多种流形（球面、平坦、双曲）以匹配局部结构，提升了图变换器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图变换器将所有节点嵌入单一欧几里得空间，忽略了异构拓扑结构，导致潜在空间解释性不足。

Method: 在现有图变换器前添加黎曼混合专家层，将节点路由到最适合其局部结构的流形（球面、平坦或双曲）。

Result: 在四个节点分类基准上，准确率提升高达3%。

Conclusion: 几何感知的投影不仅提高了预测能力，还增强了图表示的可解释性。

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making
graph representations more interpretable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DRL在多个领域取得了成功，但其策略在不同参数环境中泛化能力较差，而获取多样化的训练数据在实际应用中往往不现实。

Method: 通过引入CEBE和CSE方法，利用上下文参数中的规律性，提升单一上下文训练时的泛化能力。

Result: 理论和实验证明，CEBE能近似多上下文训练的Q函数，CSE在确定性控制环境中表现优异。

Conclusion: CSE方法在仿真环境中验证了其提升DRL泛化能力的潜力。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PU学习在许多实际应用中很重要，但现有研究通常依赖于类别先验已知或正标记数据分布受限的简化假设。本文旨在放宽这些假设，提供更广泛的理论分析。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究了PU学习在不同设置下的统计复杂性，未假设类别先验已知。

Result: 证明了正标记和未标记样本所需样本量的上下界。

Conclusion: 本文扩展了PU学习的理论框架，为实际应用提供了更灵活的统计基础。

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

Motivation: 现有方法在疾病分类中缺乏对队列特征的全面理解，且未整合患者间的共享致病依赖性。

Method: 开发了ATHENA框架，通过分层网络表示和模态学习优化患者特异性分子指纹，并结合队列模式。

Result: 在391名患者的数据集上，分类性能提升显著（AUC提高13%，F1分数提高20%）。

Conclusion: ATHENA通过可解释AI驱动的子网络聚类，支持个性化干预策略，改善动脉粥样硬化疾病预测和管理。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）方法易受奖励破解影响，且多集中于同分布（in-distribution）场景，难以应对更具挑战性的分布外（OOD）问题。

Method: 提出联合训练Bradley-Terry（BT）单目标和多目标回归奖励函数的框架，利用共享嵌入空间，理论分析BT损失与回归目标的互补性。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升奖励模型的鲁棒性和评分能力，7B模型性能超越70B基线。

Conclusion: 统一框架有效解决了奖励破解和OOD场景的挑战，为奖励模型的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

Conclusion: GRIT结合了变换器的长程依赖学习能力和图神经网络的空间模式捕捉能力，能稳健建模复杂的时空动态。

Abstract: Gaining a deeper understanding of the thickness and variability of internal

better evaluating ice dynamics processes, and minimizing uncertainties in

transformer for ice layer thickness. GRIT integrates an inductive geometric
graph learning framework with an attention mechanism, designed to map the
relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph
neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These
results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal
changes across ice layers, while the graph transformer combines the strengths
of transformers for learning long-range dependencies with graph neural networks
for capturing spatial patterns, enabling robust modeling of complex
spatiotemporal dynamics.

Conclusion: ST-GRIT通过分离的时空注意力块，有效处理噪声、避免过平滑，并捕捉长程依赖，为冰层分析提供了更全面的方法。

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于分子动力学模拟难以直接观察罕见事件（如状态转换），现有机器学习方法在CV发现中未能充分编码动态细节，因此需要一种新方法来更准确地捕获慢动态行为。

Method: TLC框架通过建模时间滞后条件分布而非静态Boltzmann分布，直接从生成模型中学习CVs，以捕获慢动态行为。

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide系统中，TLC在两种增强采样任务（SMD和OPES）中表现出与现有方法相当或更优的性能，特别是在过渡路径采样和状态区分方面。

Conclusion: TLC提供了一种更有效的方法来学习CVs，能够更好地捕获动态行为，为分子动力学模拟中的罕见事件研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法缺乏语义理解、计算成本高，且受限于自动定理证明的进展，需要更鲁棒的评估指标。

Method: 提出GTED框架，将形式化语句标准化为操作树，并使用GTED度量计算语义相似性。

Result: 在miniF2F和ProofNet基准测试中，GTED的准确率和Kappa得分均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GTED为自动评估提供了更可靠的指标，代码和实验结果已开源。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current
progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED
(Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first
standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community
with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental
results are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/GTED.

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，HGMP能适应多种任务，并显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HGMP通过统一任务格式、对比预训练和特征提示，有效解决了预训练与下游任务的适配问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: 神经网络通过预训练自然地学习世界模型的潜在状态，表现出独特的几何关系。

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the

Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）中任务目标的差异可能导致负迁移，而现有预训练Transformer的固定容量和结构限制了适应性。

Method: DTME-MTL在令牌空间中识别梯度冲突，并根据冲突类型应用自适应解决方案，避免了参数冗余。

Result: 实验表明，DTME-MTL显著提升了多任务性能，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: DTME-MTL为基于Transformer的MTL模型提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

Result: 发现CSP-LDA和MDRM-T的不确定性估计最佳，而深度学习方法分类准确性更高。

Conclusion: 所有模型都能区分难易样本，通过拒绝模糊样本可提升BCI准确性。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PVGs在非线性分类模型中具有潜力，但未应用于高维图像；CBMs能处理复杂数据但依赖低容量线性预测器。

Method: NCV通过概念编码和PVGs结合，使用非线性预测器进行决策。

Result: NCV在高维复杂数据上优于CBM和基于像素的PVG，并减少捷径行为。

Conclusion: NCV是实现高性能、可验证AI的有前景方法。

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于稳定分解的无逆正则化框架，解决了现有方法在神经网络中因数值不稳定导致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式Gram矩阵计算和求逆，导致数值不稳定，影响近似质量或产生奇异矩阵。

Method: 提出了一种无逆正则化框架，基于稳定分解，适用于GPU内存不足、输入激活矩阵接近奇异或数据不足的情况。

Result: 方法在三种挑战性场景下表现稳定，证明了收敛性并推导了误差界。

Conclusion: 新框架克服了现有方法的数值缺陷，提升了神经网络压缩和微调的稳定性。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于元学习的新型框架，用于优化条件切换（CHO），在动态信号条件下性能优于3GPP基准180%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动网络复杂性和小区规模缩小，传统切换面临延迟和失败增加的问题，条件切换（CHO）虽能缓解但引入新挑战。

Method: 采用O-RAN范式，结合元学习优化CHO，解决资源分配和信令开销问题。

Result: 在动态信号条件下，性能显著优于3GPP基准至少180%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为CHO优化提供了高效解决方案，适用于复杂移动网络环境。

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于BERT和聚类的职业映射方法，结合降维技术，优化了职业分类效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同公司或国家对职业定义存在差异，需要一种方法将O*NET数据库中的职业与其他定义进行映射。

Method: 使用BERT技术和多种聚类方法构建映射管道，并测试降维技术对聚类性能的影响。

Result: 通过改进的轮廓方法提升了聚类效果，实现了职业的自动区分。

Conclusion: 该方法为职业转换提供了新的技术支持。

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

Result: 提出了可部署的压力监测系统，为保护医护人员心理健康提供实用方案。

Conclusion: 未来研究可扩展人口多样性并探索边缘计算实现低延迟压力警报。

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化GBA调制治疗提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，SLOGAN显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SLOGAN通过因果建模和动态干预，实现了稳定的图表示迁移，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于EEG的深度学习模型在帕金森病检测中因受试者间高变异性而泛化能力不足，需要开发更适合EEG数据的新架构。

Method: 提出TransformEEG模型，结合深度卷积分词器和Transformer编码器，通过N-LNSO交叉验证与七种现有模型对比。

Result: TransformEEG在平衡准确率（78.45%）和四分位距（6.37%）上表现最佳，结合数据增强后准确率提升至80.10%。

Conclusion: TransformEEG在EEG数据上实现了更一致、可靠的帕金森病检测，显著降低了变异性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在敏感领域，协作机器学习需要可扩展且隐私保护的解决方案。传统联邦学习依赖中心服务器，存在单点故障和隐私风险，而分割学习因顺序训练扩展性差。

Method: 采用FSL与HLF结合的去中心化架构，利用HLF的瞬态字段和私有数据集合（PDCs）保护数据和模型激活的隐私，无需中心协调器。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST基准测试中，HLF-FSL达到与中心化FSL相当的准确性，同时减少每轮训练时间。性能测试显示区块链开销最小且准确性保持。

Conclusion: 该架构展示了企业级可行性，解决了隐私和扩展性问题。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise
grade viability.

Motivation: 研究深度网络中随机ReLU层对输入变化子空间的影响，揭示秩的振荡行为及其与网络宽度的关系。

Method: 通过固定输入批次和随机高斯权重，推导隐藏激活矩阵的期望秩的闭式表达式，并分析其几何衰减和振荡现象。

Result: 发现秩以几何比率衰减，并在特定深度出现局部最大值（“复兴”深度），同时证明这是有限宽度现象。

Conclusion: 随机ReLU层会交替压缩和部分恢复输入变化的子空间，为深度网络的表达能力提供了更细致的理解。

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

Conclusion: FedCBDR通过全局协调和动态温度调整有效解决了类不平衡问题，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 应用于多种模型（如Mistral-7b、GPT-4），揭示了模型的鲁棒性和行为差异。

Conclusion: GuardVal提供了更准确的漏洞评估，为未来安全模型开发提供了见解。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘方法存在浅层遗忘问题，即模型仅调整输出而内部表征仍保留信息，无法满足隐私、法律或伦理需求。

Method: 提出基于特征表示单点收缩的“深度遗忘”理论准则，并设计高效近似算法OPC。

Result: 实验表明，OPC在图像分类任务中不仅有效遗忘，还能抵抗性能恢复攻击和梯度反演攻击。

Conclusion: OPC通过深度特征遗忘提升了遗忘方法的鲁棒性，强调了改进机器学习遗忘方法的重要性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

TL;DR: TRIX是一种特征感知的对抗训练框架，通过自适应分配不同强度的对抗样本，提升弱类的鲁棒性，减少类间鲁棒性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法对所有类别采用统一目标，忽视了类间脆弱性差异，导致强类更鲁棒而弱类更易受攻击。

Method: TRIX自适应地为强类分配较弱的目标对抗样本，为弱类分配较强的非目标对抗样本，并结合损失加权和扰动强度调整。

Result: 实验表明，TRIX显著提升了最差类别在干净和对抗数据上的准确率，减少了类间鲁棒性差异，同时保持了整体准确率。

Conclusion: TRIX是实现公平且有效的对抗防御的实用方法。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为S4T的新方法，通过同步多任务行为来解决传统测试时训练（TTT）在多任务场景下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多任务下传统TTT方法因任务行为不同步导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出S4T方法，通过预测任务关系来同步多任务行为，结合传统TTT协议。

Result: S4T在多个基准测试中优于现有TTT方法。

Conclusion: S4T有效解决了多任务场景下的域适应问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

*Alba Garrido,Alejandro Almodóvar,Patricia A. Apellániz,Juan Parras,Santiago Zazo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SAMVAE的多模态深度学习框架，用于整合六种医学数据模态以改进癌症生存预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖单一数据模态，无法全面捕捉肿瘤生物学的复杂性，因此需要多模态整合。

Method: SAMVAE通过模态特定编码器将输入映射到共享潜在空间，支持生存分析和竞争风险场景。

Result: 在两个癌症队列中表现优异，优于现有方法，并首次结合竞争风险和连续时间建模。

Conclusion: SAMVAE为临床决策提供了可解释的数据驱动生存分析基础。

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

Motivation: 研究自注意力块的局部Lipschitz边界，以更准确地理解其对Transformer鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 通过改进的softmax谱范数闭式表达式计算Lipschitz常数，并提出JaSMin正则化项。

Result: 新边界更准确，揭示了注意力图与Lipschitz常数的关系，JaSMin提升了网络鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 改进的Lipschitz边界和JaSMin正则化有助于提升Transformer的鲁棒性和稳定性。

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text
features. However, existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual
columns, and identifying real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich
text features is non-trivial. We propose a series of simple yet effective
ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

Conclusion: 该算法能够从复杂专家策略中提取有意义的信息，同时保持可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

Result: 实验证明了自然梯度方法的有效性，并显示其优于欧几里得或Wasserstein几何算法。

Conclusion: 平方根参数化方法为自然梯度变分高斯推断提供了新的收敛性保证，验证了其实际优势。

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy,
yet their credit risk analysis often struggles with scarce data, especially for
online lenders lacking direct credit records. This paper introduces a Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, leveraging SME interactions from
transaction and social data to map spatial dependencies and predict loan

surpasses traditional and other GNN baselines, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.701 for

Result: 该框架支持选择理论中的弃权、非凸目标，并能自然扩展DPO设置。

Conclusion: DPO的通用视角有助于理解其局限性和改进方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗生素耐药性（AMR）加剧，现有方法无法快速识别针对新病原体的有效分子。

Method: 结合分子特征和病原体特定背景，通过离散扩散语言模型和双嵌入框架整合基因组和文献数据。

Result: 在多种细菌和化学模态中表现优于现有方法，并能可靠迁移到无抗菌数据的新病原体。

Conclusion: ApexOracle提供了一种可扩展的策略，用于对抗AMR和未来传染病爆发。

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAMO是一种轻量级的多任务优化方法，通过结合全局和局部扰动，有效缓解任务冲突，同时减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）中任务冲突限制了模型性能，而SAM（锐度感知最小化）能缓解冲突，但如何结合全局和局部信息以及减少计算开销是关键挑战。

Method: 提出SAMO方法，利用联合全局-局部扰动，通过仅前向传播近似局部扰动，并进行层归一化以提高效率。

Result: 在多个多任务基准测试中，SAMO表现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: SAMO成功解决了MTL中的任务冲突问题，同时优化了计算效率。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法通常依赖结构化稀疏性，限制了在无SIMD支持设备上的细粒度效率。UnIT旨在解决这一问题，支持动态、输入特定的剪枝。

Method: UnIT通过输入激活模式动态跳过MAC操作，将剪枝决策转化为轻量级比较，并优化阈值计算和近似除法。

Result: 在MSP430上，UnIT实现11.02%-82.03%的MAC减少，推理速度提升27.30%-84.19%，能耗降低27.33%-84.38%，精度损失仅0.48%-7%。

Conclusion: UnIT证明了无结构化推理时剪枝的可行性，为MCU上的高效神经网络部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT
matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring
significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time
pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free
deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution
accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了生成模型在数据使用中的潜在漏洞，强调了隐私保护的紧迫性。

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型仍依赖分词等预处理步骤，限制了端到端模型的潜力。

Method: 引入动态分块机制，结合分层网络（H-Net），直接从原始数据学习分块策略。

Result: H-Net在计算和数据匹配条件下优于基于BPE分词的Transformer，多级分层进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: H-Net展示了端到端模型在处理未处理数据时的潜力，尤其在分词效果差的语言和模态中表现更优。

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

Conclusion: 固定架构的预训练LLM存在局限性，动态深度调整能显著提升模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

Abstract: Conformal prediction methods are statistical tools designed to quantify
uncertainty and generate predictive sets with guaranteed coverage
probabilities. This work introduces an innovative refinement to these methods
for classification tasks, specifically tailored for scenarios where multiple
observations (multi-inputs) of a single instance are available at prediction
time. Our approach is particularly motivated by applications in citizen
science, where multiple images of the same plant or animal are captured by
individuals. Our method integrates the information from each observation into
conformal prediction, enabling a reduction in the size of the predicted label
set while preserving the required class-conditional coverage guarantee. The
approach is based on the aggregation of conformal p-values computed from each
observation of a multi-input. By exploiting the exact distribution of these
p-values, we propose a general aggregation framework using an abstract scoring
function, encompassing many classical statistical tools. Knowledge of this
distribution also enables refined versions of standard strategies, such as
majority voting. We evaluate our method on simulated and real data, with a
particular focus on Pl@ntNet, a prominent citizen science platform that
facilitates the collection and identification of plant species through
user-submitted images.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning pipelines trained on features derived from
persistent homology have been experimentally observed to ignore much of the
information contained in a persistence diagram. Computing persistence diagrams
is often the most computationally demanding step in such a pipeline, however.
To explore this, we introduce several methods to generate topological feature
vectors from unreduced boundary matrices. We compared the performance of
pipelines trained on vectorizations of unreduced PDs to vectorizations of
fully-reduced PDs across several data and task types. Our results indicate that
models trained on PDs built from unreduced diagrams can perform on par and even
outperform those trained on fully-reduced diagrams on some tasks. This
observation suggests that machine learning pipelines which incorporate
topology-based features may benefit in terms of computational cost and
performance by utilizing information contained in unreduced boundary matrices.

Abstract: Double descent is a phenomenon of over-parameterized statistical models. Our
goal is to view double descent from a Bayesian perspective. Over-parameterized
models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property
in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning
and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model
increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional
bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number
of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become
infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the
double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation.
Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor
that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when
possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model
selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future
research.

Conclusion: 二阶提案在SMC²框架中有效提升了后验近似精度和计算效率。

Abstract: When performing Bayesian inference using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
methods, two considerations arise: the accuracy of the posterior approximation
and computational efficiency. To address computational demands, Sequential
Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is well-suited for high-performance computing
(HPC) environments. The design of the proposal distribution within SMC$^2$ can
improve accuracy and exploration of the posterior as poor proposals may lead to
high variance in importance weights and particle degeneracy. The
Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) uses gradient information so that
particles preferentially explore regions of higher probability. In this paper,
we extend this idea by incorporating second-order information, specifically the
Hessian of the log-target. While second-order proposals have been explored
previously in particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) methods, we are the
first to introduce them within the SMC$^2$ framework. Second-order proposals
not only use the gradient (first-order derivative), but also the curvature
(second-order derivative) of the target distribution. Experimental results on
synthetic models highlight the benefits of our approach in terms of step-size
selection and posterior approximation accuracy when compared to other
proposals.

Conclusion: Galerkin-ARIMA结合了经典时间序列建模和非参数回归的优势，适用于复杂数据集。

Abstract: Time-series models like ARIMA remain widely used for forecasting but limited
to linear assumptions and high computational cost in large and complex
datasets. We propose Galerkin-ARIMA that generalizes the AR component of ARIMA
and replace it with a flexible spline-based function estimated by Galerkin
projection. This enables the model to capture nonlinear dependencies in lagged
values and retain the MA component and Gaussian noise assumption. We derive a
closed-form OLS estimator for the Galerkin coefficients and show the model is
asymptotically unbiased and consistent under standard conditions. Our method
bridges classical time-series modeling and nonparametric regression, which
offering improved forecasting performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: To alleviate the annotation burden in supervised learning, N-tuples learning
has recently emerged as a powerful weakly-supervised method. While existing
N-tuples learning approaches extend pairwise learning to higher-order
comparisons and accommodate various real-world scenarios, they often rely on
task-specific designs and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper,
we propose a general N-tuples learning framework based on empirical risk
minimization, which systematically integrates pointwise unlabeled data to
enhance learning performance. This paper first unifies the data generation
processes of N-tuples and pointwise unlabeled data under a shared probabilistic
formulation. Based on this unified view, we derive an unbiased empirical risk
estimator that generalizes a broad class of existing N-tuples models. We
further establish a generalization error bound for theoretical support. To
demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we instantiate it in four
representative weakly supervised scenarios, each recoverable as a special case
of our general model. Additionally, to address overfitting issues arising from
negative risk terms, we adopt correction functions to adjust the empirical
risk. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework and demonstrate that leveraging pointwise unlabeled data
consistently improves generalization across various N-tuples learning tasks.
