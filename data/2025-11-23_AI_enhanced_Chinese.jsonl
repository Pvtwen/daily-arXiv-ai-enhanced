As with a previous application of CPD to this problem, the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm is used. However, instead of allowing PELT to automatically tune its penalty parameter, a method of manually providing it is presented that dramatically reduces computation time without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, the new algorithm requires fewer input parameters and provides a formal, data-driven approach to setting the minimum FO segment length to consider as troublesome for an electromechanical mode meter. A low-order ARMAX representation of the minniWECC model is used to test the approach, where a 98\\% reduction in computation time is enjoyed with high estimation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b(CPD)\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f3a\u8feb\u632f\u8361\u8d77\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u60e9\u7f5a\u53c2\u6570\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2dPELT\u7b97\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u4f18\u60e9\u7f5a\u53c2\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f3a\u8feb\u632f\u8361\u7684\u8d77\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528PELT\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f46\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u60e9\u7f5a\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8f93\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6700\u5c0fFO\u6bb5\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728minniWECC\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1198%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u7535\u6a21\u5f0f\u8868\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u8feb\u632f\u8361\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data. Optimal control methods, such as model predictive control, also struggle with the complexity of the underlying dynamic models. Consequently, many chemical processes rely on manually defined operation recipes combined with simple linear controllers, leading to suboptimal performance and limited flexibility.\n  In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages expert knowledge embedded in operation recipes. By using reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of these recipes and their underlying linear controllers, we achieve an optimized operation recipe. This method requires significantly less data, handles constraints more effectively, and is more interpretable than traditional reinforcement learning methods due to the structured nature of the recipes. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through simulation results of an industrial batch polymerization reactor, showing that it can approach the performance of optimal controllers while addressing the limitations of existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u914d\u65b9\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5316\u5de5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u66f4\u6613\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5316\u5de5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u8282\u80fd\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u8be6\u7ec6\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u53c8\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u64cd\u4f5c\u914d\u65b9\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u65b9\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u914d\u65b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u6279\u6b21\u805a\u5408\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e14\u7531\u4e8e\u914d\u65b9\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

By integrating conductive textile patches and a compact acquisition unit into a pair of pants, the system reconstructs lower-body pose without compromising comfort. Unlike IMU-based systems that require user-specific fitting or camera-based methods that compromise privacy, our approach operates without fitting adjustments and preserves user privacy. VersaPants is a custom-designed smart garment featuring 6 capacitive channels per leg. We employ a lightweight Transformer-based deep learning model that maps capacitance signals to joint angles, enabling embedded implementation on edge platforms. To test our system, we collected approximately 3.7 hours of motion data from 11 participants performing 16 daily and exercise-based movements. The model achieves a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 11.96 cm and a mean per-joint angle error (MPJAE) of 12.3 degrees across the hip, knee, and ankle joints, indicating the model's ability to generalize to unseen users and movements. A comparative analysis of existing textile-based deep learning architectures reveals that our model achieves competitive reconstruction performance with up to 22 times fewer parameters and 18 times fewer FLOPs, enabling real-time inference at 42 FPS on a commercial smartwatch without quantization.

We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance.

Traditional Gaussian Processes (GPs) struggle to capture the underlying geometry in such settings. Some existing methods assume a flat space embedded in a point cloud, which can be represented by a single latent chart (latent space), while others exhibit weak performance when the point cloud is sparse or irregularly sampled. The goal of this work is to address these challenges. The main contributions are twofold: (1) We establish the Atlas Brownian Motion (BM) framework for estimating the heat kernel on point clouds with unknown geometries and nontrivial topological structures; (2) Instead of directly using the heat kernel estimates, we construct a Riemannian corrected kernel by combining the global heat kernel with local RBF kernel and leading to the formulation of Riemannian-corrected Atlas Gaussian Processes (RC-AGPs). The resulting RC-AGPs are applied to regression tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets. These examples demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both heat kernel estimation and regression accuracy.

Thinking models such as R1 and o1 improve their reasoning accuracy at test time as the length of the reasoning context increases. However, compared with training-time scaling, test-time scaling is fundamentally limited by the limited context length of base models, which remains orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of tokens consumed during training. We revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality. Building on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling. We show that: (1) each dimension demonstrates a test-time scaling effect, but with a bounded capacity; (2) combining all three dimensions substantially improves the reasoning performance of challenging testbeds, including IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and further benefits from human preference feedback; and (3) the human-in-the-loop framework naturally extends to a more open-ended domain, i.e., embodied learning, which enables the design of humanoid control behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e863D\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u6279\u6b21\u548c\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6d88\u8017\u7684token\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa3D\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6279\u6b21\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\u548c\u8f6e\u6b21\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u6211\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u5e94\u4f46\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ec4\u5408\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347IOI\u3001IMO\u548cCPHO\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5177\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "3D\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The model achieved a testing accuracy of 91%, outperforming traditional models such as SVM, DNN, and Logistic Regression. Training was conducted on a custom dataset created by merging data from SEED, SEED-FRA, and SEED-GER repositories, comprising 1,455 samples with EEG recordings labeled according to emotional states. The combined dataset represents one of the largest and most culturally diverse collections available. Additionally, the model allows for the reduction of the requirements of the EEG apparatus, by leveraging only 5 electrodes of the 62. This reduction demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a more affordable consumer-grade EEG headset, thereby enabling accessible, at-home use, while also requiring less computational power. This advancement sets the groundwork for future exploration into mood changes induced by media content consumption, an area that remains underresearched.

The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) extends the classical graph Fourier transform (GFT) with a fractional-order parameter, enabling flexible spectral analysis while preserving mathematical consistency. The angular graph Fourier transform (AGFT) introduces angular control via GFT eigenvector rotation; however, existing constructions fail to degenerate to the GFT at zero angle, which is a critical flaw that undermines theoretical consistency and interpretability. To resolve these complementary limitations - GFRFT's lack of angular regulation and AGFT's defective degeneracy - this study proposes an angular GFRFT (AGFRFT), a unified framework that integrates fractional-order and angular spectral analyses with theoretical rigor. A degeneracy-friendly rotation matrix family ensures exact GFT degeneration at zero angle, with two AGFRFT variants (I-AGFRFT and II-AGFRFT) defined accordingly. Rigorous theoretical analyses confirm their unitarity, invertibility, and smooth parameter dependence. Both support learnable joint parameterization of the angle and fractional order, enabling adaptive spectral processing for diverse graph signals. Extensive experiments on real-world data denoising, image denoising, and point cloud denoising demonstrate that AGFRFT outperforms GFRFT and AGFT in terms of spectral concentration, reconstruction quality, and controllable spectral manipulation, establishing a robust and flexible tool for integrated angular fractional spectral analysis in graph signal processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89d2\u5ea6\u56fe\u5206\u6570\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362(AGFRFT)\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5206\u6570\u9636\u548c\u89d2\u5ea6\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GFRFT\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89d2\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u548cAGFT\u5728\u96f6\u89d2\u5ea6\u9000\u5316\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u5206\u6570\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362(GFRFT)\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89d2\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u89d2\u5ea6\u56fe\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362(AGFT)\u5728\u96f6\u89d2\u5ea6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u9000\u5316\u5230GFT\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89d2\u5ea6GFRFT(AGFRFT)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53(I-AGFRFT\u548cII-AGFRFT)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9000\u5316\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u77e9\u9635\u65cf\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u96f6\u89d2\u5ea6\u7cbe\u786e\u9000\u5316\u5230GFT\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u6570\u9636\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u53bb\u566a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cAGFRFT\u5728\u8c31\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u8c31\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eGFRFT\u548cAGFT\u3002", "conclusion": "AGFRFT\u4e3a\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5065\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions.

Spectrum sharing between satellite and terrestrial cellular networks may, however, cause severe interference. This paper introduces a cooperation framework for integrated coexistence between satellite and terrestrial networks where the terrestrial network also deploys multistatic ISAC. Unlike prior works that assume ideal channel state information (CSI) acquisition, the proposed approach develops a practical structure consisting of pre-optimization and refinement stages that leverages the predictability of satellite CSI. In addition, a co-design of terrestrial beamforming and satellite power allocation utilizing a weighted minimum mean-squared error algorithm is proposed, and a target-radar association method designed for multistatic ISAC is presented. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly enhances the performance of these integrated networks. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the overall performance approaches the interference-free benchmark as the number of spot beams and radar receivers increases, demonstrating the feasibility of spectral coexistence between the two networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u536b\u661f\u4e0e\u5730\u9762\u7f51\u7edc\u5171\u5b58\u5408\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5904\u7406\u536b\u661fCSI\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548c\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u96c6\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u65f6\u4ee3LEO\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u5730\u9762ISAC\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u96c6\u6210\u9700\u8981\u9891\u8c31\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u536b\u661f\u4e0e\u5730\u9762\u7f51\u7edc\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u9884\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u536b\u661fCSI\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5730\u9762\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548c\u536b\u661f\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u9759\u6001ISAC\u7684\u76ee\u6807-\u96f7\u8fbe\u5173\u8054\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6ce2\u675f\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u96f7\u8fbe\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u65e0\u5e72\u6270\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u7f51\u7edc\u9891\u8c31\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u536b\u661f\u4e0e\u5730\u9762ISAC\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We also show this for Edit Flows, which falls outside of Generator Matching. That the loss can depend on $t$ clarifies that time-dependent loss weighting schemes, often used in practice to stabilize training, are theoretically justified when the specific flow or diffusion scheme is a special case of Generator Matching (or Edit Flows). It also often simplifies the construction of $X_1$-predictor schemes, which are sometimes preferred for model-related reasons.

Some of these perturbations even survive physical capture, posing security risks to high-stakes applications such as document processing, license plate recognition, and automated compliance systems. Existing defenses, such as adversarial training, input preprocessing, or post-recognition correction, are often model-specific, computationally expensive, and affect performance on unperturbed inputs while remaining vulnerable to unseen or adaptive attacks. To address these challenges, TopoReformer is introduced, a model-agnostic reformation pipeline that mitigates adversarial perturbations while preserving the structural integrity of text images. Topology studies properties of shapes and spaces that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, focusing on global structures such as connectivity, holes, and loops rather than exact distance. Leveraging these topological features, TopoReformer employs a topological autoencoder to enforce manifold-level consistency in latent space and improve robustness without explicit gradient regularization. The proposed method is benchmarked on EMNIST, MNIST, against standard adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner), adaptive attacks (EOT, BDPA), and an OCR-specific watermark attack (FAWA).", "AI": {"tldr": "TopoReformer\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u6784\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u4e14\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u672a\u6270\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u672a\u77e5\u6216\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u6d41\u5f62\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728EMNIST\u3001MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff08FGSM\u3001PGD\u3001Carlini-Wagner\uff09\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\uff08EOT\u3001BDPA\uff09\u548cOCR\u7279\u5b9a\u6c34\u5370\u653b\u51fb\uff08FAWA\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TopoReformer\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, current implementations of Rydberg array antennas predominantly rely on simple stacking of multiple single-antenna units. While conceptually straightforward, this approach leads to substantial system bulkiness due to the unique requirements of atomic sensors, particularly the need for multiple spatially separated laser setups, rendering such designs both impractical for real-world applications and challenging to fabricate. This limitation underscores the critical need for developing multiplexed Rydberg sensor array architectures. In the domain of conventional RF array antennas, hybrid analog-digital beamforming has emerged as a pivotal architecture for large-scale millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, as it substantially reduces the hardware complexity associated with fully-digital beamforming while closely approaching its performance. Drawing inspiration from this methodology, we conduct a systematic study in this work on the design principles, equivalent modeling, and precoding strategies for low-complexity multiplexed Rydberg array, an endeavor crucial to enabling practical and scalable quantum-enhanced communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u9635\u5217\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d7\u4f20\u7edf\u5c04\u9891\u9635\u5217\u5929\u7ebf\u4e2d\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u62df-\u6570\u5b57\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u578b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u91cf\u5b50\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u9635\u5217\u56e0\u9700\u8981\u591a\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u6fc0\u5149\u8bbe\u7f6e\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e9e\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u9635\u5217\u5929\u7ebf\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5355\u5806\u53e0\u591a\u4e2a\u5355\u5929\u7ebf\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u539f\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u8981\u6c42\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9700\u8981\u591a\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6fc0\u5149\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e9e\u5927\u3001\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u5236\u9020\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9635\u5217\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u4f20\u7edf\u5c04\u9891\u9635\u5217\u5929\u7ebf\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u62df-\u6570\u5b57\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u9635\u5217\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u7406\u3001\u7b49\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u9635\u5217\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u6570\u5b57\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u9635\u5217\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, standard OCP faces two key limitations: it operates in the output space using simple nonconformity (NC) scores, and it treats all historical observations uniformly when estimating quantiles. This paper introduces attention-based feature OCP (AFOCP), which addresses both limitations through two key innovations. First, AFOCP operates in the feature space of pre-trained neural networks, leveraging learned representations to construct more compact prediction sets by concentrating on task-relevant information while suppressing nuisance variation. Second, AFOCP incorporates an attention mechanism that adaptively weights historical observations based on their relevance to the current test point, effectively handling non-stationarity and distribution shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that AFOCP maintains long-term coverage while provably achieving smaller prediction intervals than standard OCP under mild regularity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that AFOCP consistently reduces the size of prediction intervals by as much as $88\\%$ as compared to OCP, while maintaining target coverage levels, validating the benefits of both feature-space calibration and attention-based adaptive weighting.", "AI": {"tldr": "AFOCP\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdb\u5728\u7ebf\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5728\u7ebf\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u975e\u4fdd\u5f62\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u5386\u53f2\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1", "method": "\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u5386\u53f2\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAFOCP\u76f8\u6bd4OCP\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1188%\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u8986\u76d6\u7387", "conclusion": "AFOCP\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u52a0\u6743\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347"}}

However, existing joint time-vertex transforms such as the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform assign only one fractional order to the spatial domain and another one to the temporal domain, thereby restricting their capacity to model the complex and continuously varying dynamics of graph signals. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dynamic multiple-parameter joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (DMPJFRFT) framework, which introduces time-varying fractional parameters to achieve adaptive spectral modeling of dynamic graph structures. By assigning distinct fractional orders to each time step, the proposed transform enables dynamic and flexible representation of spatio-temporal signal evolution in the joint time-vertex spectral domain. Theoretical properties of the DMPJFRFT are systematically analyzed, and two filtering approaches: a gradient descent-based method and a neural network-based method, are developed for dynamic signal restoration.

Despite high predictive performance, existing machine learning approaches lack transparency and robustness, limiting clinical adoption. We present a lightweight, transparent multimodal ensemble that fuses physiological time-series measurements with unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability: feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision. On the MIMIC-III benchmark, our late-fusion ensemble improves discrimination over the best single model (AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526; AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876) while maintaining well-calibrated predictions.

The segmented PASS design is used to yield the tractable uplink transmission, and to mitigate large-scale path loss and in-waveguide loss. Based on three operating protocols, namely segment selection (SS), segment aggregation (SA), and segment multiplexing (SM), the joint transmit and receive beamforming problem is formulated: 1) The mean square error (MSE) minimization problem is formulated for computation-oriented cases. To address this problem, a low-complexity alternating optimization-minimum mean square error (AO-MMSE) algorithm is developed. This problem is decomposed into receiver-side and transmitter-side MSE subproblems that are iteratively optimized by MMSE receivers to obtain the closed-form solutions. It is mathematically proved that the segmented JCC-PASS framework significantly outperforms the conventional PASS for the average in-waveguide propagation gain. 2) The weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem is formulated for communication-oriented cases. To solve the decomposed receiver-side and transmitter-side MSE subproblems, the AO-weighted minimum mean square error (AO-WMMSE) algorithm is further developed. An auxiliary weight variable is introduced to linearize the WSR function and is alternatively optimized based on WMMSE to derive the closed-form solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed JCC-PASS framework achieves up to 70.65% and 45.32% reductions in MSE compared with conventional MIMO and conventional PASS, and ii) it reaches 87.70% and 51.35% improvements in WSR compared with conventional MIMO and conventional PASS, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u6bb5\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8054\u5408\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u4e0a\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u548c\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5185\u635f\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u8f93\u901a\u4fe1\u6bd4\u7279\u6d41\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u6bb5\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u6bb5\u805a\u5408\u3001\u6bb5\u590d\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bfc\u5411\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5bfc\u5411\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86AO-MMSE\u548cAO-WMMSE\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u6536\u53d1\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684MIMO\u548cPASS\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684JCC-PASS\u6846\u67b6\u5728MSE\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8670.65%\u548c45.32%\uff0c\u5728WSR\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8687.70%\u548c51.35%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6bb5JCC-PASS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As a theoretical contribution, we establish that for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers, reducing data unfairness necessarily leads to lower classification unfairness, thus providing a direct link between privacy-aware pre-processing and classification fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes.

Existing global attribution methods often incur high computational costs, lack stability under correlated inputs, and fail to scale efficiently to large or heterogeneous datasets. We address these gaps with \\emph{ExCIR} (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a correlation-aware attribution score equipped with a lightweight transfer protocol that reproduces full-model rankings using only a fraction of the data. ExCIR quantifies sign-aligned co-movement between features and model outputs after \\emph{robust centering} (subtracting a robust location estimate, e.g., median or mid-mean, from features and outputs). We further introduce \\textsc{BlockCIR}, a \\emph{groupwise} extension of ExCIR that scores \\emph{sets} of correlated features as a single unit. By aggregating the same signed-co-movement numerators and magnitudes over predefined or data-driven groups, \\textsc{BlockCIR} mitigates double-counting in collinear clusters (e.g., synonyms or duplicated sensors) and yields smoother, more stable rankings when strong dependencies are present.

GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.\n  On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the \"Full\" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the \"Scarce\" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.\n  In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.\n  These results show that rigorous physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases can achieve large gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE).", "AI": {"tldr": "GLOBE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u9f50\u6b21PDE\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u754c\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7b49\u53d8ML\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002\u5b83\u5728AirFRANS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u70b9\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u7269\u7406\u548c\u9886\u57df\u542f\u53d1\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u7684ML-based PDE\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5de5\u4e1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7c7b\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u6838\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u8868\u793a\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u652f\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d85\u5c42\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u6709\u5e73\u79fb\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u5b87\u79f0\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7ec6\u7f51\u683c\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u79bb\u6563\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u65e0\u91cf\u7eb2\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u4f4d\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5728AirFRANS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGLOBE\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\"Full\"\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u6240\u6709\u573a\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea6200\u500d\uff0c\u5728\"Scarce\"\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u901f\u5ea6\u538b\u529b\u573a\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e100\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u8868\u9762\u538b\u529b\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e600\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u7d27\u51d1\uff08117k\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u70b9\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u975e\u6c34\u5bc6\u7f51\u683c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u9886\u57df\u542f\u53d1\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728ML-based PDE\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1aCAE\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5b9e\u8df5\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a novel neural positioning pipeline that avoids the need for any external reference positioning system. Our approach trains the positioning network only using CSI acquired off-device and relative displacement commands executed on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) robot platforms, such as robotic vacuum cleaners -- such an approach enables inexpensive training of accurate neural positioning functions over large areas. We evaluate our method in three real-world scenarios, ranging from small line-of-sight (LoS) areas to larger non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments, using CSI measurements acquired in IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi and 5G New Radio (NR) systems.

While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power.

When this criterion maximizes the probability of accepting some draft token, it is called the optimal transport (OT). However, finding the OT is difficult, as it is the solution of a linear program (OTLP) in over $V^n$ variables, with $V$ being the vocabulary size. Two recent theoretical works have reframed the OTLP in terms of importance sampling or subset selection. In this work, we prove that these formulations are equivalent to an exponentially large relaxed OTLP, so it remains infeasible to solve. Then, we reverse engineer subset selection to formulate the OTLP as a max-flow problem. With a novel application of polymatroid theory, we reduce the exponentially large OTLP to a convex optimization problem in at most $V$ variables. This allows us to devise an algorithm for optimal $n$-draft speculative sampling when the $n$ tokens are chosen i.i.d. from a single draft model, which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy. Finally, we measure acceptance rates and algorithm runtimes for various $n$ and top-$k$ draft sampling settings. Our findings give the first multi-draft algorithm with 90% acceptance and under 100 ms of overhead per generated token with negligible deviation from the target model distribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684n-draft\u63a8\u6d4b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7406\u8bba\u5c06\u5176\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u6700\u591aV\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8690%\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u4e8e100ms\u7684\u6bcftoken\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u6d4b\u91c7\u6837\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7684\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u8349\u7a3f\u6269\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7406\u8bba\u5c06\u5176\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u53ef\u8c03\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684n-draft\u63a8\u6d4b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8690%\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u4e8e100ms\u7684\u6bcftoken\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u8349\u7a3f\u63a8\u6d4b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Building on the Every Call is Precious (ECP) framework, which ensures that each accepted function evaluation is potentially informative, ECPv2 addresses key limitations of ECP, including high computational cost and overly conservative early behavior. ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability. We further empirically validate these findings through extensive experiments and ablation studies. Using principled hyperparameter settings, we evaluate ECPv2 across a wide range of high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problems.

Vivaldi antennas are one of the prominent choices for the aforementioned systems due to their natural wideband characteristics. Furthermore, tightly-coupled antenna arrays have been researched in the recent years to extend the lower band edge of compact arrays by taking advantage of the strong mutual coupling between the elements especially with dipole elements, but not with dual-polarized Vivaldi antennas. This paper presents a novel tightly-coupled dual-polarized antipodal Vivaldi antenna (TC-AVA) with -6 dB impedance bandwidth of 3 to 20 GHz. The tight coupling by overlapping the Vivaldi leaves is shown to extend the lower band edge from 3.75 to 3 GHz and 2.75 GHz, an improvement of 20% to 25% for both polarizations, compared with an isolated antipodal Vivaldi element.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u53cc\u6781\u5316\u5bf9\u8dd6\u7ef4\u74e6\u5c14\u7b2c\u5929\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u53e0\u5929\u7ebf\u53f6\u7247\u5b9e\u73b0\u7d27\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4e\u9891\u8fb9\u7f18\u4ece3.75GHz\u6269\u5c55\u52303GHz\u548c2.75GHz\uff0c\u963b\u6297\u5e26\u5bbd\u8fbe\u52303-20GHz\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u3001\u9891\u8c31\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6269\u9891\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u5bbd\u5e26\u5b54\u5f84\uff0c\u7ef4\u74e6\u5c14\u7b2c\u5929\u7ebf\u56e0\u5176\u5929\u7136\u5bbd\u5e26\u7279\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u4f18\u9009\u3002\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u5355\u5143\u95f4\u5f3a\u4e92\u8026\u6269\u5c55\u7d27\u51d1\u9635\u5217\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u8fb9\u7f18\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u524d\u672a\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u6781\u5316\u7ef4\u74e6\u5c14\u7b2c\u5929\u7ebf\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u53cc\u6781\u5316\u5bf9\u8dd6\u7ef4\u74e6\u5c14\u7b2c\u5929\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u53e0\u7ef4\u74e6\u5c14\u7b2c\u5929\u7ebf\u53f6\u7247\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u5143\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863-20GHz\u7684-6dB\u963b\u6297\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b64\u7acb\u5bf9\u8dd6\u7ef4\u74e6\u5c14\u7b2c\u5355\u5143\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6781\u5316\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u8fb9\u7f18\u5206\u522b\u4ece3.75GHz\u6269\u5c55\u52303GHz\u548c2.75GHz\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e8620%\u81f325%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53cc\u6781\u5316\u7ef4\u74e6\u5c14\u7b2c\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u5bbd\u5e26\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Developing a method to remove such complex noise and reconstruct high-fidelity signals is clinically valuable for diagnostic accuracy. However, denoising of multi-beat ECG segments remains understudied and poses technical challenges. To address this, we propose Time-Frequency Complementary Diffusion (TFCDiff), a novel approach that operates in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain and uses the DCT coefficients of noisy signals as conditioning input. To refine waveform details, we incorporate Temporal Feature Enhancement Mechanism (TFEM) to reinforce temporal representations and preserve key physiological information. Comparative experiments on a synthesized dataset demonstrate that TFCDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across five evaluation metrics. Furthermore, TFCDiff shows superior generalization on the unseen SimEMG Database, outperforming all benchmark models. Notably, TFCDiff processes raw 10-second sequences and maintains robustness under flexible random mixed noise (fRMN), enabling plug-and-play deployment in wearable ECG monitors for high-motion scenarios.

DiffuApriel matches the performance of Transformer-based diffusion models while achieving up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences with a 1.3B model.

This work investigates the \"Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter\" (AOPF) class as a solution. We introduce two models operating in the [-1, 1] domain: 1) `L-JacobiNet`, the adaptive generalization of `ChebyNet` with learnable alpha, beta shape parameters, and 2) `S-JacobiNet`, a novel baseline representing a LayerNorm-stabilized static `ChebyNet`. Our analysis, comparing these models against AOPFs in the [0, infty) domain (e.g., `LaguerreNet`), reveals critical, previously unknown trade-offs. We find that the [0, infty) domain is superior for modeling heterophily, while the [-1, 1] domain (Jacobi) provides superior numerical stability at high K (K>20). Most significantly, we discover that `ChebyNet`'s main flaw is stabilization, not its static nature. Our static `S-JacobiNet` (ChebyNet+LayerNorm) outperforms the adaptive `L-JacobiNet` on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets, identifying `S-JacobiNet` as a powerful, overlooked baseline and suggesting that adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain can lead to overfitting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668(AOPF)\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8c31GNN\u7684\u5f02\u914d\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86L-JacobiNet\u548cS-JacobiNet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728[0,\u221e)\u57df\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u914d\u6027\uff0c\u800c[-1,1]\u57df\u5728\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0ChebyNet\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u975e\u9759\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8c31GNN\u5982ChebyNet\u7531\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u914d\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668(AOPF)\u7c7b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1) L-JacobiNet\uff08ChebyNet\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6cdb\u5316\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684alpha\u3001beta\u5f62\u72b6\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff1b2) S-JacobiNet\uff08LayerNorm\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9759\u6001ChebyNet\u57fa\u7ebf\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0[0,\u221e)\u57df\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u914d\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c[-1,1]\u57df\u5728\u9ad8K\u503c(K>20)\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u9759\u6001S-JacobiNet\u57285\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u76844\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94L-JacobiNet\u3002", "conclusion": "ChebyNet\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7f3a\u9677\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u975e\u9759\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0cS-JacobiNet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u4f46\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728[-1,1]\u57df\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002"}}

A self-supervised representation was pretrained with the large MIR spectral library and the Variational Autoencoder algorithm to obtain a compressed latent space for generating spectral embeddings. At this stage, only unlabeled spectral data were used, allowing us to leverage the full spectral database and the availability of scan repeats for augmented training. We also leveraged and froze the trained MIR decoder for a spectrum conversion task by plugging it into a NIR encoder to learn the mapping between NIR and MIR spectra in an attempt to leverage the predictive capabilities contained in the large MIR library with a low cost portable NIR scanner. This was achieved by using a smaller subset of the KSSL library with paired NIR and MIR spectra. Downstream machine learning models were then trained to map between original spectra, predicted spectra, and latent space embeddings for nine soil properties.

This trade-off is dictated by the choice of spectral domain. Filters in the finite [-1, 1] domain (e.g., ChebyNet) are numerically stable at high polynomial degrees (K) but are static and low-pass, causing them to fail on heterophilic graphs. Conversely, filters in the semi-infinite [0, infty) domain (e.g., KrawtchoukNet) are highly adaptive and achieve SOTA results on heterophily by learning non-low-pass responses. However, as we demonstrate, these adaptive filters can also suffer from numerical instability, leading to catastrophic performance collapse at high K. In this paper, we propose to resolve this trade-off by designing a hybrid-domain GNN, HybSpecNet, which combines a stable `ChebyNet` branch with an adaptive `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We first demonstrate that a \"naive\" hybrid architecture, which fuses the branches via concatenation, successfully unifies performance at low K, achieving strong results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. However, we then prove that this naive architecture fails the stability test. Our K-ablation experiments show that this architecture catastrophically collapses at K=25, exactly mirroring the collapse of its unstable `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We identify this critical finding as \"Instability Poisoning,\" where `NaN`/`Inf` gradients from the adaptive branch destroy the training of the model. Finally, we propose and validate an advanced architecture that uses \"Late Fusion\" to completely isolate the gradient pathways. We demonstrate that this successfully solves the instability problem, remaining perfectly stable up to K=30 while retaining its SOTA performance across all graph types. This work identifies a critical architectural pitfall in hybrid GNN design and provides the robust architectural solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Our argument relies on optimally coupling the random behavior of the unlearning and retraining trajectories, resulting in a probabilistic sensitivity bound that can be combined with a novel relaxed Gaussian mechanism to achieve $(\u03b5, \u03b4)$ unlearning. We determine that D2D can yield tighter guarantees for strongly convex functions compared to R2D by relying on contraction to a unique global minimum.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5b50\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u5bf9\u9f50(SGA)\u548c\u968f\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u63a9\u7801(RTM)\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f30\u8ba1\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ece\u672a\u88ab\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\uff0c\u4e14\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u626d\u66f2\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "SGA\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6cbb\u7597\u65e0\u5173\u805a\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b50\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\uff1bRTM\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u66ff\u6362\u8f93\u5165\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u72ec\u5e94\u7528SGA\u548cRTM\u90fd\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u5408\u59cb\u7ec8\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SGA\u548cRTM\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff1aRTM\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800cSGA\u6539\u8fdb\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u53bb\u6df7\u6742\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

While traditional data-driven methods attempt to bridge this gap using satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), they often suffer from severe, non-random data missingness (e.g., due to cloud cover or nighttime) and inversion biases. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes the Spatiotemporal Physics-Guided Inference Network (SPIN), a novel framework designed for inductive spatiotemporal kriging. Unlike conventional approaches, SPIN synergistically integrates domain knowledge into deep learning by explicitly modeling physical advection and diffusion processes via parallel graph kernels. Crucially, we introduce a paradigm-shifting training strategy: rather than using error-prone AOD as a direct input, we repurpose it as a spatial gradient constraint within the loss function. This allows the model to learn structural pollution patterns from satellite data while remaining robust to data voids. Validated in the highly polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Surrounding Areas (BTHSA), SPIN achieves a new state-of-the-art with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.52 ug/m^3, effectively generating continuous, physically plausible pollution fields even in unmonitored areas.

However, research studies have shown that LLMs lack the ability to identify causal relationships, a fundamental cornerstone of human intelligence. We first conduct an exploratory investigation of LLMs' behavior when asked to perform a causal-discovery task and find that they mostly rely on the semantic meaning of variable names, ignoring the observation data. This is unsurprising, given that LLMs were never trained to process structural datasets. To first tackle this challenge, we prompt the LLMs with the outputs of established causal discovery algorithms designed for observational datasets. These algorithm outputs effectively serve as the sufficient statistics of the observation data. However, quite surprisingly, we find that prompting the LLMs with these sufficient statistics decreases the LLMs' performance in causal discovery. To address this current limitation, we propose CARE, a framework that enhances LLMs' causal-reasoning ability by teaching them to effectively utilize the outputs of established causal-discovery algorithms through supervised fine-tuning.

Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula. Empirically, Agent0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities, improving the Qwen3-8B-Base model by 18% on mathematical reasoning and 24% on general reasoning benchmarks.

Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control. However, using activation-magnitude importance, VGG-16 implementing our CoB+TSRA framework shows encouraging results on CIFAR-10. Under fixed-ratio structured pruning, CoB improves accuracy over a TSRA baseline at all pruning ratios and extends reliable pruning frontier from roughly $30\\%$ to $70\\%$ of parameters without post-prune fine tuning. Under threshold-based pruning strategies, CoB prunes $90-96\\%$ of parameters while maintaining $1-6\\%$ accuracy drop after fine-tuning. Together, these results indicate that rotationally invariant architectures may offer a promising path towards CoB pruning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570TSRA\uff0c\u4f7f\u53d8\u57fa\u526a\u679d\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u5728VGG-16\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u53d8\u57fa\u526a\u679d\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u5c06\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u6b64\u53d8\u6362\u4e0d\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f84\u5411\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570(TSRA)\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u5176\u4e24\u4e2a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u53d8\u57fa\u53d8\u6362\u80fd\u591f\u5408\u5e76\u5230\u5468\u56f4\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728VGG-16\u4e0a\uff0c\u53d8\u57fa\u526a\u679d\u5728\u6240\u6709\u526a\u679d\u6bd4\u7387\u4e0b\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8eTSRA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u9760\u526a\u679d\u8fb9\u754c\u4ece\u7ea630%\u6269\u5c55\u523070%\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u526a\u679d\u540e\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u7684\u526a\u679d\u4e2d\uff0c\u526a\u966490-96%\u53c2\u6570\u540e\u4ec5\u635f\u59311-6%\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u53d8\u57fa\u526a\u679d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u76ee\u524d\u5b58\u57284.52%\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We propose a Gauge-Equivariant Graph Network with Self-Interference Cancellation (GESC), which replaces additive aggregation with a projection-based interference mechanism. Unlike prior magnetic or gauge-equivariant GNNs that typically focus on phase handling in spectral filtering while largely relying on scalar weighting, GESC introduces a $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ phase connection followed by a rank-1 projection that attenuates self-parallel components before attention. A sign- and phase-aware gate further regulates neighbor influence, attenuating components aligned with current node states and acting as a local notch on low-frequency modes.

This article describes a new two-step process to design a more refined resume evaluation model based on a small language model (<600M parameters) that is finetuned using GRPO on a custom reward function. To begin with, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to build a solid baseline model. Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching. We indicate that the RL application presents a critical problem of reward hacking due to the initial experiments of aggressive penalties, which produces faulty, excessively negative model behaviors. We have overcome this challenge by refining the reward function repeatedly and training hyperparameters into a stable \"gentle polishing process\" of the reward function. Our resulting GRPO-polished model demonstrates significant real-world efficacy, achieving a final accuracy of 91% on unseen test data. The model shows a strong ability to correctly identify qualified candidates (recall of 0.85 for the 'SELECTED' class) while also showing exceptional precision (1.0), confirming its reliability. These results indicate that a properly executed, two-step fine-tuning procedure can indeed effectively refine a small language model to be able to conduct fine-tuned and human-like candidate scoring, overcoming the drawbacks of both traditional ATS and naive RL usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548cGRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7b80\u5386\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfATS\u7cfb\u7edf\u50f5\u5316\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523091%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfATS\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u56e0\u5fae\u5c0f\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u62d2\u7edd\u4f18\u79c0\u5019\u9009\u4eba\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u7b80\u5386\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u5fae\u8c03\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u590d\u8c03\u6574\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523091%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9'SELECTED'\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e3a0.85\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u4e3a1.0\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u5fae\u8c03\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u3001\u7c7b\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edfATS\u548c\u6734\u7d20RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002"}}

Due to limitations in dataset sizes, many models are trained by aggregating bioactivity data from diverse sources, including public databases such as ChEMBL. However, this approach often introduces significant noise due to variability in experimental protocols. We introduce AssayMatch, a framework for data selection that builds smaller, more homogenous training sets attuned to the test set of interest. AssayMatch leverages data attribution methods to quantify the contribution of each training assay to model performance. These attribution scores are used to finetune language embeddings of text-based assay descriptions to capture not just semantic similarity, but also the compatibility between assays. Unlike existing data attribution methods, our approach enables data selection for a test set with unknown labels, mirroring real-world drug discovery campaigns where the activities of candidate molecules are not known in advance. At test time, embeddings finetuned with AssayMatch are used to rank all available training data. We demonstrate that models trained on data selected by AssayMatch are able to surpass the performance of the model trained on the complete dataset, highlighting its ability to effectively filter out harmful or noisy experiments.

While double critics reduce such biases, the exploration potential of double actors remains underexplored. Building on temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR), a double actor-critic framework, this work introduces enhanced methods to achieve flexible bias control and stronger representation learning. We propose three convex combination strategies, symmetric and asymmetric, that balance pessimistic estimates to mitigate overestimation and optimistic exploration via double actors to alleviate underestimation. A single hyperparameter governs this mechanism, enabling tunable control across the bias spectrum. To further improve performance, we integrate augmented state and action representations into the actor and critic networks.

Although many studies have used deep learning or generative AI methods to model trajectories and have achieved promising results, the robustness and interpretability of such models are largely unexplored. This limits the application of trajectory generation algorithms on noisy real-world data and their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we exploit the regular structure in urban trajectories and propose a deep generative model based on the pathlet representation, which encode trajectories with binary vectors associated with a learned dictionary of trajectory segments. Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to describe the trajectory generation process, which includes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) component and a linear decoder component. During training, the model can simultaneously learn the latent embedding of pathlet representations and the pathlet dictionary that captures mobility patterns in the trajectory dataset. The conditional version of our model can also be used to generate customized trajectories based on temporal and spatial constraints.\n  Our model can effectively learn data distribution even using noisy data, achieving relative improvements of $35.4\\%$ and $26.3\\%$ over strong baselines on two real-world trajectory datasets. Moreover, the generated trajectories can be conveniently utilized for multiple downstream tasks, including trajectory prediction and data denoising.

Consequently, current research predominantly focuses on Unsupervised Time-series Anomaly Detection (UTAD), relying on complex architectures to model normal data distributions. However, this approach often overlooks the significant performance gains available from limited anomaly labels achievable in practical scenarios. This paper challenges the premise that architectural complexity is the optimal path for TSAD. We conduct the first methodical comparison between supervised and unsupervised paradigms and introduce STAND, a streamlined supervised baseline. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that: (1) Labels matter more than models: under a limited labeling budget, simple supervised models significantly outperform complex state-of-the-art unsupervised methods; (2) Supervision yields higher returns: the performance gain from minimal supervision far exceeds that from architectural innovations; and (3) Practicality: STAND exhibits superior prediction consistency and anomaly localization compared to unsupervised counterparts.

While recent neural architectures capture content and structural features, they often fail to reveal the underlying causal mechanisms of misinformation spread. We propose CausalMamba, a novel framework that integrates Mamba-based sequence modeling, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and differentiable causal discovery via NOTEARS. CausalMamba learns joint representations of temporal tweet sequences and reply structures, while uncovering latent causal graphs to identify influential nodes within each propagation chain. Experiments on the Twitter15 dataset show that our model achieves competitive classification performance compared to strong baselines, and uniquely enables counterfactual intervention analysis.

By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency. The results showed that both the DM and conditional DM can successfully generate realistic and physics-consistent CHF data. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification was performed to establish confidence in the generated data. The results demonstrated that the conditional DM is highly effective in augmenting CHF data while maintaining acceptable levels of uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6838\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u514b\u670d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u754c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6838\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5f80\u5f80\u6709\u9650\u3001\u6602\u8d35\u6216\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0b\u6e38\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u3002\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u70ed\u5de5\u6c34\u529b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807CHF\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684CHF\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u589e\u5f3aCHF\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u514b\u670d\u6838\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3002"}}

Labeled datasets for crop-type classification are inherently scarce and remain costly to obtain. When working with such limited data, training sets are frequently constructed to be artificially balanced -- in particular in the case of few-shot learning -- failing to reflect real-world conditions. This mismatch induces a shift between training and test label distributions, degrading real-world generalization. To address this, we propose Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA), a novel method that simulates an unknown label distribution skew of the target domain proactively during model training. Specifically, we model the real-world distribution as Dirichlet-distributed random variables, effectively performing a prior augmentation during few-shot learning. Our experiments show that DirPA successfully shifts the decision boundary and stabilizes the training process by acting as a dynamic feature regularizer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u659c\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u519c\u4e1a\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u519c\u4e1a\u5206\u5e03\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff08\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u6602\u8d35\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5e38\u4eba\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u5316\uff0c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3-\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aDirichlet\u5206\u5e03\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u671f\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5148\u9a8c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u659c\u3002", "result": "DirPA\u6210\u529f\u8f6c\u79fb\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u6b63\u5219\u5668\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "DirPA\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u519c\u4e1a\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of \"exploration collapse\", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes. We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization.

This paper addresses these problems by proposing \\textbf{Geo}metric \\textbf{P}rototype \\textbf{T}rajectory \\textbf{H}ashing (GeoPTH), a novel, lightweight, and non-learning framework for efficient category-based trajectory retrieval. GeoPTH constructs data-dependent hash functions by using representative trajectory prototypes, i.e., small point sets preserving geometric characteristics, as anchors. The hashing process is efficient, which involves mapping a new trajectory to its closest prototype via a robust, \\textit{Hausdorff} metric. Extensive experiments show that GeoPTH's retrieval accuracy is highly competitive with both traditional metrics and state-of-the-art learning methods, and it significantly outperforms binary codes generated through simple binarization of the learned embeddings. Critically, GeoPTH consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency. Our work demonstrates that a lightweight, prototype-centric approach offers a practical and powerful alternative, achieving an exceptional retrieval performance and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoPTH\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u539f\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u951a\u70b9\u6784\u5efa\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u5927\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8f68\u8ff9\u539f\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u951a\u70b9\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Hausdorff\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c06\u65b0\u8f68\u8ff9\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u539f\u578b", "result": "\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u539f\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387"}}

Counterfactual explanations address this challenge by seeking the closest alternative scenario where the model's prediction would change. Although counterfactual explanations are extensively studied in tabular data and computer vision, the graph domain remains comparatively underexplored. Constructing graph counterfactuals is intrinsically difficult because graphs are discrete and non-euclidean objects. We introduce Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation, a novel framework for generating counterfactual explanations on graph data, combining discrete diffusion models and classifier-free guidance.

Rather than relying solely on nominal models, the proposed framework treats the system matrices as optimizable variables and refines them through gradient-based minimization of a steady-state output discrepancy loss. The resulting data-informed surrogate model enables the construction of an improved observer that effectively compensates for moderate parameter uncertainty while preserving the structure of classical designs. Extensive Monte Carlo studies across diverse system dimensions show systematic and statistically significant reductions, typically exceeding 15\\%, in normalized estimation error for both open-loop and Luenberger observers. These results demonstrate that modern learning mechanisms can serve as a powerful complement to traditional observer design, yielding more accurate and robust state estimation in uncertain systems.

However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4.

Yet, most health sensing studies focus narrowly on physical chronic diseases. This overlooks the critical need for joint assessment of comorbid physical chronic diseases and depression, which is essential for collaborative chronic care. We conceptualize multi-disease assessment, including both physical diseases and depression, as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, where each disease assessment is modeled as a task. This joint formulation leverages inter-disease relationships to improve accuracy, but it also introduces the challenge of double heterogeneity: chronic diseases differ in their manifestation (disease heterogeneity), and patients with the same disease show varied patterns (patient heterogeneity). To address these issues, we first adopt existing techniques and propose a base method. Given the limitations of the base method, we further propose an Advanced Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning (ADH-MTL) method that improves the base method through three innovations: (1) group-level modeling to support new patient predictions, (2) a decomposition strategy to reduce model complexity, and (3) a Bayesian network that explicitly captures dependencies while balancing similarities and differences across model components. Empirical evaluations on real-world wearable sensor data demonstrate that ADH-MTL significantly outperforms existing baselines, and each of its innovations is shown to be effective.

While recent generative models based on denoising diffusion have advanced state-of-the-art performance in capturing complex data distributions, they suffer from significant computational overhead due to iterative stochastic sampling procedures that limit real-time deployment. Moreover, these models can be brittle when handling high-dimensional, non-stationary, and multi-scale periodic patterns characteristic of real-world sensor networks. We introduce FreqFlow, a novel framework that leverages conditional flow matching in the frequency domain for deterministic MTS forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time domain, FreqFlow transforms the forecasting problem into the spectral domain, where it learns to model amplitude and phase shifts through a single complex-valued linear layer. This frequency-domain formulation enables the model to efficiently capture temporal dynamics via complex multiplication, corresponding to scaling and temporal translations. The resulting architecture is exceptionally lightweight with only 89k parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than competing diffusion-based models-while enabling single-pass deterministic sampling through ordinary differential equation (ODE) integration. Our approach decomposes MTS signals into trend, seasonal, and residual components, with the flow matching mechanism specifically designed for residual learning to enhance long-term forecasting accuracy.

However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation.

While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728ANT\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DT\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u66f4\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5c06\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5df2\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5728ANT\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982CQL\u548cIQL\uff09\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "DT\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e2d\u7b49\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1bIQL\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff1bCQL\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\uff1bDT\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u5dee\u8f83\u4f4e\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6216\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

However, these functions often struggle to approximate the Pareto front accurately, rendering them unideal in complex, uncertain environments. This study examines selected Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms across MORL environments with discrete action and observation spaces. We aim to investigate further the limitations associated with scalarisation approaches for decision-making in multi-objective settings. Specifically, we use an outer-loop multi-policy methodology to assess the performance of a seminal single-policy MORL algorithm, MO Q-Learning implemented with linear scalarisation and Chebyshev scalarisation functions. In addition, we explore a pioneering inner-loop multi-policy algorithm, Pareto Q-Learning, which offers a more robust alternative. Our findings reveal that the performance of the scalarisation functions is highly dependent on the environment and the shape of the Pareto front. These functions often fail to retain the solutions uncovered during learning and favour finding solutions in certain regions of the solution space. Moreover, finding the appropriate weight configurations to sample the entire Pareto front is complex, limiting their applicability in uncertain settings.

However, these models demand substantial computational resources and storage, and their growing complexity limits our understanding of how they make decisions. Most of these architectures rely on the attention mechanism within Transformer-based designs. Building upon the connection between residual neural networks and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce ODE-ViT, a Vision Transformer reformulated as an ODE system that satisfies the conditions for well-posed and stable dynamics. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ODE-ViT achieves stable, interpretable, and competitive performance with up to one order of magnitude fewer parameters, surpassing prior ODE-based Transformer approaches in classification tasks. We further propose a plug-and-play teacher-student framework in which a discrete ViT guides the continuous trajectory of ODE-ViT by treating the intermediate representations of the teacher as solutions of the ODE.

However, most existing FL research assumes consistent client participation, overlooking the practical scenario of dynamic participation (DPFL), where clients may intermittently join or leave during training. Moreover, no existing benchmarking framework systematically supports the study of DPFL-specific challenges. In this work, we present the first open-source framework explicitly designed for benchmarking FL models under dynamic client participation. Our framework provides configurable data distributions, participation patterns, and evaluation metrics tailored to DPFL scenarios. Using this platform, we benchmark four major categories of widely adopted FL models and uncover substantial performance degradation under dynamic participation. To address these challenges, we further propose Knowledge-Pool Federated Learning (KPFL), a generic plugin that maintains a shared knowledge pool across both active and idle clients. KPFL leverages dual-age and data-bias weighting, combined with generative knowledge distillation, to mitigate instability and prevent knowledge loss.

Although a variety of bias-mitigation methods have been proposed, many rely on computationally expensive debiasing strategies or suffer substantial drops in model accuracy, which limits their practicality in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address this issue, we propose a fairness-oriented low rank factorization (LRF) framework that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve DL model fairness. Unlike traditional SVD, which is mainly used for model compression by decomposing and reducing weight matrices, our work shows that SVD can also serve as an effective tool for fairness enhancement. Specifically, we observed that elements in the unitary matrices obtained from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across groups defined by sensitive attributes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method, named FairLRF, that selectively removes bias-inducing elements from unitary matrices to reduce group disparities, thus enhancing model fairness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms conventional LRF methods as well as state-of-the-art fairness-enhancing techniques. Additionally, an ablation study examines how major hyper-parameters may influence the performance of processed models.

We theoretically demonstrate the limitation of its universal approximation property, that is, the iterative errors do not satisfy norm convergence if the selection of random parameters is inappropriate and the convergence rate meets certain conditions. To address this issue, we propose the broad stochastic configuration residual learning system (BSCRLS) algorithm, which features a novel supervisory mechanism adaptively constraining the range settings of random parameters on the basis of BRLS framework, Furthermore, we prove the universal approximation theorem of BSCRLS based on the more stringent norm convergence.

We propose a family of latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods for minority oversampling that use conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees as the vector-field learner. The models operate in compact latent spaces to preserve tabular structure and reduce computation. We introduce three variants: PCAForest, which uses linear PCA embedding; EmbedForest, which uses a learned nonlinear embedding; and AttentionForest, which uses an attention-augmented embedding. Each method couples a GBT-based flow with a decoder back to the original feature space. Across 11 datasets from healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, AttentionForest achieves the best average minority recall while maintaining competitive precision, calibration, and distributional similarity. PCAForest and EmbedForest reach similar utility with much faster generation, offering favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Privacy evaluated with nearest-neighbor distance ratio and distance-to-closest-record is comparable to or better than the ForestDiffusion baseline. Ablation studies show that smaller embeddings tend to improve minority recall, while aggressive learning rates harm stability. Overall, latent-space, tree-driven diffusion provides an efficient and privacy-aware approach to high-fidelity tabular data augmentation under severe class imbalance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6811\u9a71\u52a8\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6811\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u572811\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u5747\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8868\u683c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982GANs\u3001VAEs\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff1aPCAForest\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027PCA\u5d4c\u5165\uff0cEmbedForest\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\uff0cAttentionForest\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u6bcf\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8eGBT\u7684\u6d41\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8026\u5408\u56de\u539f\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "AttentionForest\u572811\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u5747\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002PCAForest\u548cEmbedForest\u4ee5\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u6811\u9a71\u52a8\u6269\u6563\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of its long-run behavior remains limited: existing analyses typically establish convergence in expectation or with high probability, but do not address the almost sure convergence of single trajectories. In this work, we prove that DP-SGD converges almost surely under standard smoothness assumptions, both in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, provided the step sizes satisfy some standard decaying conditions. Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees.

With enough training data, it should capture intricate patterns in the tactile measurements that go beyond a simple map of forces -- the current state of the art. To validate our approach, we both develop a simulation environment and collect a real-world dataset of soft objects and corresponding ground truth images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{\u00ef}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times r},\\ B\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times r}$ with $r\\ll \\min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)$ rate. Our experiments show that (1) EGGROLL does not compromise the performance of ES in tabula-rasa RL settings, despite being faster, (2) it is competitive with GRPO as a technique for improving LLM reasoning, and (3) EGGROLL enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes.", "AI": {"tldr": "EGGROLL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5168\u79e9\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u77e9\u9635\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6279\u91cf\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u65f6\u3002EGGROLL\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f7f\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5177\u6709\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5927\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "EGGROLL\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u6270\u52a8A\u2208\u211d^{m\u00d7r}\u548cB\u2208\u211d^{n\u00d7r}(\u5176\u4e2dr\u226amin(m,n))\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u5168\u79e9\u6270\u52a8E\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u6270\u52a8AB^\u22a4\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8f85\u52a9\u5b58\u50a8\u4ecemn\u51cf\u5c11\u5230r(m+n)\uff0c\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6210\u672c\u4eceO(mn)\u964d\u4f4e\u5230O(r(m+n))\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a(1) EGGROLL\u5728\u8868\u683cRL\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u727a\u7272ES\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b(2) \u5728\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4e0eGRPO\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b(3) \u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7eaf\u6574\u6570\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "EGGROLL\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment.
