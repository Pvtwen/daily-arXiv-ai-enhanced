Motivation: 传统交替优化方法在SIM层数增加时容易陷入性能饱和，需要寻找更有效的优化策略来提升堆叠智能超表面的性能潜力。

Method: 提出定制化的交替优化框架：1) 先优化SIM相位偏移再优化数字波束成形；2) 使用迭代投影梯度方法而非单步投影梯度来优化相位偏移。

Result: 所提方法相比基准方案实现了高达115.53%的可达和速率提升，有效避免了传统方法在SIM层数增加时的性能饱和问题。

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a disruptive
technology for future wireless networks. To investigate their capabilities, we
study the sum rate maximization problem in an SIM-based multiuser (MU)
multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink system. A vast majority of pioneer
studies, if not all, address this fundamental problem using the prevailing
alternating optimization (AO) framework, where the digital beamforming (DB) and
SIM phase shifts are optimized alternately. However, many of these approaches
suffer from suboptimal performance, quickly leading to performance saturation,
when the number of SIM layers increases assuming the \emph{fixed SIM
thickness}. In this letter, we demonstrate that significant performance gains
can still be achieved, and such saturation does not occur with the proposed
method in the considered setting. To this end, we provide practical design
guidelines to improve AO-based optimization of digital precoders and SIM phase
shifts. Specifically, we show that (i) optimizing the SIM phase shifts first
yields significant performance improvements, compared to optimizing the DB
first; and (ii) when applying projected gradient (PG) methods, which are
gradually becoming more popular to optimize the phase shifts thanks to their
scalability, we find that using an iterative PG method achieves better
performance than the single PG step, which is commonly used in existing
solutions. Based on these customizations, the proposed method achieves a higher
achievable sum rate (ASR) of up to $\ensuremath{115.53\%}$, compared to
benchmark schemes for the scenarios under consideration.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology holds immense potential
for increasing the performance of wireless networks. Therefore, RIS is also
regarded as one of the solutions to address communication challenges in
high-mobility scenarios, such as Doppler shift and fast fading. This paper
investigates a high-speed train (HST) multiple-input single-output (MISO)
communication system aided by a RIS. We propose a block coordinate descent
(BCD) algorithm to jointly optimize the RIS phase shifts and the transmit
beamforming vectors to maximize the channel gain. Numerical results are
provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the
system performance, achieving an average channel gain improvement of 15 dB
compared to traditional schemes. Additionally, the introduction of RIS
eliminates outage probability and improves key performance metrics such as
achievable rate, channel capacity, and bit error rate (BER). These findings
highlight the critical role of RIS in enhancing HST communication systems.

Abstract: Ongoing discussions about the future of wireless communications are reaching
a turning point as standardization activities for the sixth generation of
mobile networks (6G) become more mature. New technologies must now face renewed
scrutiny by the industry and academia in order to be ready for deployment in
the near future. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) gained
attention as a promising solution for improving the propagation conditions of
signal transmission in general. The RIS is a planar array of tunable resonant
elements designed to dynamically and precisely manipulate the reflection of
incident electromagnetic waves. However, the physical structure of the RIS and
its components may be subject to practical limitations and imperfections. It is
imperative that the hardware imperfections (HWIs) associated with the RIS be
analyzed, so that it remains a feasible technology from a practical standpoint.
Moreover, solutions for mitigating the HWIs must be considered, as is discussed
in this work. More specifically, we introduce a gradient descent optimization
for mitigating HWIs in RIS-aided wideband communication systems. Numerical
results show that the proposed optimization is able to compensate for HWIs such
as the phase-shift noise (PSN) and RIS surface deformations.

Result: 该方法能够有效处理宽频带信号的反射问题，克服了传统RIS配置中的带宽限制

Conclusion: 所提出的频率选择性反射配置方法为解决RIS在宽频带通信系统中的实际应用障碍提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recently, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has ushered
in the prospect of control over the wireless propagation environment. By
establishing alternative propagation paths for the transmitted signals, and by
reflecting them in a controllable manner, the RIS is able to improve the signal
reception. However, an aspect often overlooked is the potential bandwidth
restrictions on the wideband signal reflected by the RIS. If not carefully
considered, this can become an impediment for the adoption of the RIS in the
next generation of communications systems. Therefore, in this work we propose a
RIS configuration method that provides frequency selective signal reflection
for wideband signals.

### [5] [On the Compromise Between Performance and Efficiency in RIS-aided Communication Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15599)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: STAR-RIS技术通过同时传输和反射信号，解决了传统RIS系统覆盖范围有限和信号放大潜力受限的问题，能够提升无线通信系统的覆盖、能效和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RIS系统受限于仅反射的约束，限制了空间覆盖和信号放大潜力。需要一种能够同时传输和反射信号的新技术来突破这些限制。

Method: 采用同时传输和反射的可重构智能表面（STAR-RIS）技术，通过其双功能特性同时处理传输和反射信号。

Conclusion: STAR-RIS技术为无线通信系统提供了更全面的解决方案，通过双功能操作突破了传统RIS的限制，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology for metasurfaces is
ushering in a new paradigm for wireless communication systems. It provides an
accessible way for controlling the interaction between electromagnetic waves
with the propagation medium. One particularly important aspect is the
configuration of the RIS elements or reflectors. Simply stated, the objective
of the RIS configuration is to choose the optimum phase-shift combination that
maximizes the channel capacity. Recently, neural networks (NNs) were proposed
for tackling this task and results have shown that the proposed NN promotes far
less reconfigurations of the RIS, consequently reducing the configuration
overhead. Beyond that, the RIS can be repurposed for tackling the Doppler shift
in high-mobility communication systems. Despite not being its usual primary
goal, results have also demonstrated that the RIS can compensate for the
Doppler shift at a small cost in performance. However, the typical
reflection-only constraint for RIS systems limits the spatial coverage and
signal amplification potential achieved by such systems. Therefore, the
simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface
(STAR-RIS) can be employed to address these limitations by its dual
functionality of transmitting and reflecting signals concurrently. It can be
shown that the STAR-RIS can augment coverage, energy efficiency, and latency
reduction, while enhancing sum-rate and physical-layer security across several
wireless contexts.

*Nishant Mehrotra,Sandesh Rao Mattu,Saif Khan Mohammed,Ronny Hadani,Robert Calderbank*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Zak-OTFS调制方案用于雷达感知，通过离散Heisenberg-Weyl群和辛变换设计波形，将传统雷达信号处理复杂度从O(B²T²)降低到O(BT log T)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统连续雷达信号处理复杂度高，需要开发更高效的雷达波形设计和处理方案，利用离散群理论来优化雷达性能。

Method: 在延迟-多普勒域形成雷达波形，通过匹配滤波和相关处理生成散射环境图像，利用离散Heisenberg-Weyl群和辛变换进行波形设计。

Result: 实现了复杂度从O(B²T²)到O(BT log T)的显著降低，能够定义具有小峰均功率比的最优雷达波形库。

Conclusion: 基于离散群理论的Zak-OTFS方法为雷达感知提供了高效的计算框架和优化的波形设计策略。

Abstract: Zak-OTFS is modulation scheme where signals are formed in the delay-Doppler
(DD) domain, converted to the time domain (DD) for transmission and reception,
then returned to the DD domain for processing. We describe how to use the same
architecture for radar sensing. The intended delay resolution is $\frac{1}{B}$
where $B$ is the radar bandwidth, and the intended Doppler resolution is
$\frac{1}{T}$ where $T$ is the transmission time. We form a radar waveform in
the DD domain, illuminate the scattering environment, match filter the return,
then correlate with delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. This
produces an image of the scattering environment, and the radar ambiguity
function expresses the blurriness of this image. The possible delay and Doppler
shifts generate the continuous Heisenberg-Weyl group which has been widely
studied in the theory of radar. We describe how to approach the problem of
waveform design, not from the perspective of this continuous group, but from
the perspective of a discrete group of delay and Doppler shifts, where the
discretization is determined by the intended delay and Doppler resolution of
the radar. We describe how to approach the problem of shaping the ambiguity
surface through symplectic transformations that normalize our discrete
Heisenberg-Weyl group. The complexity of traditional continuous radar signal
processing is $\mathcal{O}\big(B^2T^2\big)$. We describe how to reduce this
complexity to $\mathcal{O}\big(BT\log T\big)$ by choosing the radar waveform to
be a common eigenvector of a maximal commutative subgroup of our discrete
Heisenberg-Weyl group. The theory of symplectic transformations also enables
defining libraries of optimal radar waveforms with small peak-to-average power
ratios.

Abstract: The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is revolutionizing industrial
processes by facilitating massive machine-type communications among countless
interconnected devices. To efficiently handle the resulting large-scale and
sporadic traffic, grant-free random access protocols-especially coded random
access (CRA)-have emerged as scalable and reliable solutions. At the same time,
advancements in wireless hardware, including extremely large-scale MIMO arrays
and high-frequency communication (e.g., mmWave, Terahertz), are pushing network
operations into the near-field propagation regime, allowing for dense
connectivity and enhanced spatial multiplexing. This paper proposes an
innovative approach that combines near-field spatial multiplexing with the
interference mitigation capabilities of CRA, utilizing an extremely large
aperture array at the access point. This integration improves reliability and
reduces access latency, offering a robust framework for IIoT connectivity in
next-generation 6G networks.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究分析了示波法血压测量的系统误差来源，提出基于最小二乘和最大似然估计的校正框架，通过多测量统计先验提高非侵入式血压监测精度。

Method: 使用MIMIC数据库的血压波形数据，提出估计理论框架，采用最小二乘(LS)和最大似然(ML)方法校正单次和重复血压测量。LS支持传统多测量平均协议，ML方法整合测量误差的先验知识。

Result: 示波法倾向于低估收缩压和高估舒张压，呼吸引入周期性变化进一步降低测量精度。利用多读数统计先验可显著提高非侵入式血压监测的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的统计估计框架能有效校正示波法血压测量的系统误差，对改善心血管疾病诊断和治疗具有潜在应用价值，ML方法因整合先验知识而表现更优。

Abstract: Oscillometry is the standard method for non-invasive, cuff-based blood
pressure (BP) measurement, but it introduces systematic errors that may impact
clinical accuracy. This study investigates the sources of these
errors--primarily the limitations of oscillometry itself and
respiration-induced fluctuations--using BP waveform data from the MIMIC
database. Oscillometry tends to underestimate systolic BP and overestimate
diastolic BP, while respiration introduces cyclical variations that further
degrade measurement precision. To mitigate these effects, we propose an
estimation-theoretic framework employing least squares (LS) and maximum
likelihood (ML) methods for correcting both single and repeated BP
measurements. LS estimation supports conventional multi-measurement averaging
protocols, whereas the ML approach incorporates prior knowledge of measurement
errors, offering improved performance. Our results demonstrate that leveraging
statistical priors across multiple readings can enhance the accuracy of
non-invasive BP monitoring, with potential implications for improving
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment.

Conclusion: 联邦学习为非线性系统辨识提供了有效的分布式解决方案，通过多客户端协作可以克服单个设备数据有限的限制，在保持隐私的同时提升系统辨识性能。

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

Motivation: 因为不同患者群体和临床环境存在显著差异，没有单一模型能在所有群体中都表现最佳，需要个性化的风险预测方案

Method: 两阶段流水线：1、使用FAISS相似性搜索在9个多样化真实世界群体中找到最相似的患者群体；2、用LLM分析找到的群体和其模型表现指标，从8个代表性模型中推荐最优预测算法

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

Conclusion: HHNAS-AM方法通过分层组织和自适应变异策略，能够有效探索多样化架构配置，显著提升文本分类任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

*Rui Wang,Qianguo Sun,Chao Song,Junlong Wu,Tianrong Chen,Zhiyun Zeng,Yu Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LPO是一种新的偏好对齐框架，通过梯度解耦、偏移约束和可控拒绝抑制来解决DPO的过拟合和崩溃问题，在多个任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO虽然简单稳定但容易过拟合和崩溃，需要更鲁棒的偏好优化算法。

Method: 引入梯度解耦（用绝对差损失替代log-sigmoid）、偏移约束加正正则化保持响应质量、可控拒绝抑制（梯度分离和可调系数）。

Result: 在通用文本任务、数学任务和文本转语音任务上均表现出性能提升。

Conclusion: LPO提供了一个鲁棒且可调的偏好对齐范式，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot) 是一种集成不确定性估计的优化方法，通过并行训练两个相同模型并周期性重置均值，提供局部不确定性估计和正则化效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度下降方法缺乏置信度度量，特别是在过参数化和数据稀缺场景下容易过拟合。传统bootstrap方法在深度学习中存在训练成本高、无法指导学习过程、以及非凸优化中假设失效等问题

Method: 并行训练两个相同模型于独立bootstrap样本上，通过周期性均值重置保持两个轨迹在同一优化盆地内，利用其发散度估计局部不确定性，并在训练过程中自适应采样权重进行正则化

Result: 在深度神经网络和高维逆问题中，该方法提高了校准性和泛化能力，并产生可解释的不确定性图谱

Conclusion: Twin-Boot成功将不确定性估计集成到优化过程中，为深度学习提供了有效的正则化和不确定性量化方法

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Motivation: 现有方法仅迁移用户表示而忽略物品表示和交叉表示，且简单将用户表示作为下游特征使用，无法弥合上下游差距并忽略了更多迁移粒度

Method: 提出LFM4Ads框架：1）全面迁移三种表示；2）识别最佳提取层并聚合交叉表示；3）采用非线性适配器（特征级）、同构交互模块（模块级）和独立检索（模型级）的多粒度迁移机制

Result: 在腾讯工业级广告平台成功部署，处理每日数百亿样本，模型参数量达TB级。自2024年Q4部署以来，在微信朋友圈和视频号等主要场景实现10+次成功上线，整体平台GMV提升2.45%，预计年收入增加数亿美元

Conclusion: LFM4Ads通过全表示迁移和多粒度机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在工业规模广告推荐中取得了显著的业务效果和经济效益

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在异质腐败率下的鲁棒估计问题，为多元有界分布和单变量高斯分布的均值估计提供了紧的极小极大率，并为多元高斯均值估计和线性回归建立了平方误差的极小极大率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于分布式学习、联邦学习、众包和传感器网络等实际应用中，样本可能以已知但非相同的概率被独立腐败，而现有鲁棒估计器通常忽略这种结构性异质性，假设均匀或最坏情况腐败。

Method: 采用极小极大理论框架，分析不同腐败模式下的最优估计性能。对于多元有界分布和单变量高斯分布，给出了所有异质腐败模式的紧极小极大率；对于多元高斯均值估计和线性回归，建立了平方误差的极小极大率。

Result: 研究发现最优估计器可能会丢弃超过特定腐败阈值的样本，该阈值由给定的腐败率经验分布决定。为不同分布类型提供了具体的极小极大率界限。

Conclusion: 该研究为异质腐败环境下的鲁棒估计提供了理论基础和性能界限，表明考虑腐败率的结构性异质性对设计最优估计器至关重要，特别是在实际应用中腐败率非均匀分布的场景。

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to

selection during training. Our results show that DiffQAS-QLSTM consistently
outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test
settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum
sequence learning.

<details>

Motivation: 现代优化算法对超参数选择敏感，调参困难且资源消耗大，需要提高算法的稳定性。

Method: 提出NGN-M算法，将动量机制与NGN步长调整方法相结合，在更宽松的假设条件下达到标准收敛速率。

Result: 算法在保持与最先进优化器相当性能的同时，显著提高了对步长超参数选择的稳定性。

Conclusion: NGN-M算法通过动量与自适应步长的结合，为深度学习优化问题提供了更稳定且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

Motivation: 传统的大气遥感数据修复方法会模糊精细结构特征，而深度学习方法缺乏置信度估计。需要一种既能恢复精细尺度特征又能提供不确定性量化的方法。

Method: 采用课程引导的掩码比例训练策略，通过蒙特卡洛随机掩码实现集成推理，使用ViT解码器从稀疏上下文中重建大气场，并生成像素级不确定性图。

Result: 能够恢复上升/下沉气流核心、切变线和小涡旋等精细尺度特征，学习数据驱动的大气场先验，并提供像素级不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高保真重建，支持增强的对流诊断、实时数据同化和改进的长期气候再分析，为大气遥感数据处理提供了新的深度学习工作流程。

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统语言模型在处理长上下文时面临的计算复杂度和内存使用效率问题，需要设计一种能够结合状态空间模型效率、稀疏注意力、专家混合容量和可学习记忆的混合架构。

Method: 集成Mamba风格的结构化状态空间模型(SSM)主干，结合间歇性稀疏全局注意力、块级MoE前馈路由和双重记忆系统(工作记忆+事实PKM记忆)，采用分阶段课程学习策略稳定激活各组件。

Result: 在玩具规模原型(数千万参数)上验证了实现可行性和定性扩展行为，展示了长上下文吞吐量交叉和可控专家路由等特性，但尚未进行大规模性能验证。

Conclusion: Hydra提供了一个蓝图架构，结合了SSM效率、选择性稀疏注意力、MoE容量和可学习记忆，为模块化、输入自适应的长上下文语言模型指明了发展方向，但大规模端任务性能验证仍需未来工作。

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多窗口对比学习框架，通过从每个ECG实例中提取多个时间窗口构建正样本对，利用慢特征分析原理学习时间不变性特征，在PTB-XL数据集上取得了优于传统双视图方法的性能，同时显著减少了预训练时间和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督对比学习方法通常只生成成对的增强视图，未能充分利用ECG记录中丰富的时间结构信息，限制了模型学习稳健ECG表示的能力。

Method: 多窗口对比学习框架：从每个ECG实例中提取多个时间窗口构建正样本对，通过统计方法最大化它们的一致性，并基于慢特征分析原理鼓励模型学习跨时间持久的时间不变性和生理学有意义的特征。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集的多标签超类分类任务中，AUROC达到0.891（vs 0.888），F1分数达到0.680（vs 0.679），预训练轮次减少4倍（32 vs 128），总预训练时间减少14.8%。

Conclusion: 多窗口对比学习为自动化ECG分析提供了一种高效且可扩展的范式，并为生物医学时间序列数据的自监督表示学习提供了一个有前景的通用框架。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

Conclusion: GEOs成功弥合了神经算子理论与实践的差距，为无限维凸优化问题的有效求解提供了理论保证和实用方法，参数需求大幅降低且具有实际可训练性。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Conclusion: 量子采样与经典采样的差异主要体现在分布的中低概率区域，这些区域对采样质量影响较小。但量子采样在快速生成多样化样本方面具有潜力，可用于灾难性遗忘缓解等机器学习应用

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种高效的自动化方案，能够在保证内存安全的前提下，为大型机器学习模型找到最优的分布式分片策略。

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

TL;DR: SEAL是一种可解释的图神经网络，通过将分子图分解为化学相关片段并估计其对输出的因果影响，为分子属性预测提供直观可信的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络虽然能有效预测分子属性，但其黑盒特性降低了可解释性，限制了在药物发现等关键应用中的可信度。现有解释技术往往无法可靠量化原子或子结构的贡献。

Method: SEAL将输入分子图分解为化学相关片段，通过减少片段间消息传递来明确估计每个片段对模型输出的因果影响，实现预测与片段贡献的强对齐。

Result: 在合成基准测试和真实分子数据集上的广泛评估表明，SEAL在定量归因指标和人类对齐可解释性方面均优于其他可解释性方法。用户研究证实SEAL为领域专家提供了更直观可信的解释。

Conclusion: SEAL通过弥合预测性能与可解释性之间的差距，为更透明和可操作的分子建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的层冻结技术，通过相似性感知通道增强和渐进式压缩策略，有效解决了传统特征图缓存方法中的增强应用和存储开销问题，显著降低了深度神经网络训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络和数据集规模的增大，训练计算成本显著增加。传统层冻结方法虽然能减少训练成本，但冻结层仍需前向传播生成特征图，限制了计算成本的进一步降低。现有特征图缓存方法存在增强应用困难和存储开销大的问题，需要系统性的解决方案。

Method: 提出相似性感知通道增强技术，缓存具有高增强敏感性的通道以最小化额外存储成本；结合有损数据压缩设计渐进式压缩策略，随着更多层被冻结而增加压缩率，有效降低存储开销。

Result: 该方法在保持模型精度的同时显著降低了训练成本，仅带来较小的时间开销。同时提供了关于冻结和压缩策略优化的全面评估和见解。

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面探索了层冻结缓存方法中的关键挑战，并提供了系统解决方案，为高效DNN训练提供了有效的优化途径，在计算成本和存储效率方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

Motivation: 研究深度神经网络中"愚弄样本"现象，即DNN对看似随机的输入产生高置信度分类的问题，旨在理解DNN在过参数化状态下的泛化机制。

Method: 提出了基于最大似然估计的分析框架，避免使用传统的基于梯度的优化方法和显式标签，通过理论分析探索特征空间坍塌现象。

Result: 发现DNN在过参数化状态下会出现特征空间坍塌，虽然改善泛化但最终导致退化状态；提出的"虫洞解"能够绕过退化问题，调和随机输入与有意义标签的关系。

Conclusion: 研究为理解DNN泛化机制提供了新见解，揭示了短路学习的本质，并为无监督学习动态的未来研究指明了方向，有助于弥合理论与实践的差距。

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估稀疏自编码器(SAE)在减少神经元多义性方面的效果，提出了基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念可分离性评分，并开发了新的干预方法APP，在目标概念移除方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在神经元多义性问题，即单个神经元对多个不相关概念都有响应。虽然稀疏自编码器被提出用于缓解此问题，但缺乏与基础模型的定量比较。

Method: 使用Gemma-2-2B模型和多种SAE变体，在五个基准测试上评估。提出基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念可分离性评分，并开发了Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP)干预方法。

Result: SAE确实减少了多义性并提高了概念可分离性，但更高的稀疏性并不总是带来更好的可分离性，且往往损害下游性能。APP方法在目标概念移除方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAE能有效提升神经元解释性，但需要在稀疏性和性能间权衡。新提出的APP方法为精确的概念级控制提供了有效工具，推动了可解释AI的发展。

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

Motivation: 随着文本到图像生成模型的普及，隐私、版权和安全问题日益突出，概念擦除技术被开发用于防止生成特定不良概念。然而这些技术的实际效果和鲁棒性需要系统评估。

Method: 提出了Side Effect Evaluation (SEE)评估基准，包含层次化和组合式提示词，通过自动化评估流程从三个维度量化CETs的副作用：对邻近概念的影响、目标规避能力和属性泄露情况。

Result: 实验发现CETs可以通过超类-子类层级结构和语义相似提示词轻松绕过，存在严重的属性泄露问题，并表现出注意力集中或分散的反常现象。

Conclusion: 当前的概念擦除技术存在根本性缺陷，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。作者发布了数据集、代码和评估工具以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了源无法获取去学习的挑战，为在无法获取原始训练数据的情况下从模型中删除特定数据提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

Motivation: 传统强化学习缺乏统一的数学框架来处理不同类型的动态系统模型。作者希望利用范畴论和余代数等抽象数学工具，为RL建立一个更通用、形式化的理论基础，特别是为了处理异步并行分布式计算场景。

Method: 1. 使用范畴和函子对RL进行建模，将MDP/PSR算法空间表示为函子范畴
2. 引入Bertsekas和Tsitsiklis的异步分布式最小化标准模型
3. 利用度量余归纳证明异步收敛定理
4. 将各种动态系统(MDP、POMDP、PSR、LDS)统一为余代数特例
5. 将RL中的固定点求解问题推广为在分布式环境中异步确定最终余代数

Result: 建立了一个统一的范畴化RL框架，能够：

- 在拓扑结构中容纳所有(余)极限、子对象分类器和指数对象
- 为异步并行分布式RL计算提供形式化基础

Conclusion: 范畴论和余代数为强化学习提供了强大的数学抽象工具，使得能够建立通用的URL框架，统一处理传统RL模型并支持异步分布式计算，为RL理论发展开辟了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid

Motivation: 越狱攻击通过制作对抗性提示绕过对齐机制，导致LLM产生有害内容，严重威胁模型安全性。现有防御方法存在安全保证不足、控制精度不够等问题。

Method: 三阶段管道：1) 混合方法动态检测有害输出；2) 通过FFN激活进行词级有害内容追踪定位有害知识；3) 约束优化抑制不安全行为而不降低模型质量

Result: 在多个越狱基准测试中显著降低攻击成功率，同时保持高性能。相比标准防御方法提供更强的安全保证、更精确的控制和更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 遗忘学习是LLM安全领域一个可扩展且有效的有前景方向，SafeLLM框架实现了有针对性和不可逆的有害知识遗忘。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

Result: 开发了一个可扩展的基准测试框架，支持标准化流程和可重复评估，为数据级公平性研究提供实用基础。

Conclusion: FairPrep填补了公平性基准测试领域的关键空白，为推进数据级公平性研究提供了重要工具支持。

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

Motivation: 传统手动睡眠分期耗时且易出错，现有机器学习方法因EEG/EOG信号的非平稳性和变异性导致泛化能力差，需要开发能够处理多模态信号并具有良好泛化能力的方法

Method: 开发多变量差分变换器(SleepDIFFormer)架构，处理EEG和EOG时间序列信号，采用跨域对齐训练，通过特征分布对齐学习领域不变的联合表示，减少时空注意力噪声

Conclusion: SleepDIFFormer方法显著提升了自动化睡眠分期性能，具有良好的泛化能力，对睡眠质量评估应用有重要推进作用

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code
is publicly available at https://github.com/Ben1001409/SleepDIFFormer

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多归因学习框架(MAL)，通过整合不同归因机制的转化信号来提升在线广告系统的转化率预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法只使用单一归因机制的标签进行模型训练，忽略了其他归因视角的补充信号，导致模型性能受限。

Method: 设计了包含归因知识聚合器(AKA)和主要目标预测器(PTP)的联合学习框架，以及利用所有归因标签组合的卡尔积训练策略(CAT)来生成丰富的监督信号。

Result: 离线实验显示GAUC提升0.51%，在线实验实现投资回报率(ROI)提升2.6%。

Conclusion: MAL框架通过整合多重归因视角，显著提升了CVR预测的性能和实际业务效果，为广告系统提供了更好的转化模型解决方案。

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Conclusion: 该研究提出的基于局部最优性保证的框架能够在保持解释质量的同时显著提高解释合成的扩展性，为黑盒机器学习模型提供可信过的解释开启了新方向。

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting.
However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think

reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full

TL;DR: 本文批判性评估了CSG复杂度指标在知识图谱链接预测中的有效性，发现其参数敏感性高且与性能指标相关性弱，提出了更可靠的基于关系熵和多样性的新指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解数据集复杂度对于评估知识图谱链接预测模型至关重要，但现有的CSG指标尚未在KG环境中得到验证，需要系统评估其有效性和稳定性。

Method: 在多关系链接预测背景下检验CSG指标，引入transformer嵌入的语义表示，并提出并基准测试一组结构和语义KG复杂度指标，包括关系熵、最大关系多样性等。

Result: CSG对参数高度敏感，不能稳健地随类别数量扩展，与MRR和Hit@1相关性弱或不一致。关系熵、最大关系多样性和关系类型基数等指标与性能指标呈强负相关。

Conclusion: CSG在链接预测设置中的稳定性和泛化预测能力不成立，需要更稳定、可解释且与任务对齐的数据集复杂度度量方法。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Conclusion: 部分逻辑在解决未知类别相关挑战方面具有显著有效性，PL-Reg方法为处理现实应用中未知类别的泛化问题提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across
diverse modeling paradigms.

Motivation: DeepONet输出相对于分支网络最后一层参数是线性的，这些参数可以用最小二乘法优化，但直接求解所有分支和主干输入组合的大型线性系统不可行

Method: 将大型最小二乘系统分解为分支网络和主干网络两个更小的子问题分别求解，该方法可推广到带正则化项的L2损失函数，包括物理信息无监督学习

Result: 该方法能够高效处理原本不可行的大型线性系统，实现了训练加速

Conclusion: 提出的混合优化方法有效解决了DeepONet训练中的计算瓶颈问题，为物理信息无监督学习等场景提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多元高斯聚类重叠检测方法，专门用于数据流在线学习中的聚类合并，比现有方法更快且能准确检测重叠聚类


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线数据流学习中，由于概念漂移会产生大量可能重叠的聚类需要合并，但现有的分布差异度量方法无法有效处理所有形状的聚类且计算成本高

Method: 设计了一种专门检测重叠而非差异的相似性度量方法，能够快速计算并适用于多元高斯聚类

Result: 该方法比对比方法快数倍，能够有效检测重叠聚类，同时避免正交聚类的错误合并

Conclusion: 提出的重叠检测方法为在线数据流学习中的聚类合并提供了高效准确的解决方案，特别适合处理多元高斯分布的重叠检测问题

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不可逆投影变换的机器遗忘方法MRP，通过在特定网络层的隐藏状态空间实施投影变换，有效消除有害信息同时保留有用知识，解决了现有方法难以实现持续遗忘和抵御重新学习攻击的问题。

Motivation: 大型语言模型可能内部存储不安全知识，现有机器遗忘方法仅通过参数训练抑制不良数据激活，无法完全消除信息痕迹，难以实现有效持续遗忘且易受重新学习攻击。

Method: 提出Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP)方法，将不可逆投影特性应用于机器遗忘，在特定网络层的隐藏状态空间实施投影变换，彻底消除有害信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，MRP方法能够实现有效的持续遗忘，成功抵御重新学习攻击，在遗忘效果方面达到最先进性能，同时保持自然性能。

Conclusion: MRP方法通过不可逆投影变换有效解决了机器遗忘中的根本限制，为模型安全提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的局部鲁棒性验证器要么分析时间过长，要么精度损失太大，难以有效处理大量输入。需要一种能够利用网络计算相似性来减少整体分析时间的新方法。

Method: 提出group local robustness verification方法，动态构建具有相似网络计算的ε-ball mini-batches进行联合验证。如果mini-batch验证通过，则所有ε-ball都被证明是鲁棒的；否则指导细化过程。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10的全连接和卷积网络上评估，BaVerLy平均将验证速度提升2.3倍，最高可达4.1倍，将总分析时间从24小时减少到6小时。

Conclusion: BaVerLy通过利用网络计算的相似性，有效提升了局部鲁棒性验证的效率，为大规模输入集的鲁棒性分析提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

Motivation: 现有的基于检索的欧几里得嵌入方法无法有效捕捉分子相互作用的层次结构和细粒度亲和力变化，特别是在活性悬崖等挑战性案例中。

Method: 提出HypSeek框架，利用双曲空间的指数几何和负曲率特性，采用蛋白质引导的三塔架构，在Lorentz模型双曲空间中进行嵌入学习。

Result: 在DUD-E数据集上虚拟筛选的早期富集从42.63提升到51.44（+20.7%），在JACS数据集上亲和力排名相关性从0.5774提升到0.7239（+25.4%）。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为蛋白质-配体建模提供了强大的归纳偏置，能够有效建模全局活性和细微功能差异，特别是在活性悬崖等挑战性场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

Result: 大量实验证明该方法在各种基于图的公平性任务中具有有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 通过优化伪任务中的公平性可以有效增强结构公平性，促进不同下游应用的公平性泛化。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPOF是一种用于多用户本地差分隐私的稳定扰动损失函数训练机制，通过扰动泰勒展开多项式近似来保护隐私，相比DP-SGD在计算效率和稳定性方面表现更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的梯度基隐私保护方法如DP-SGD需要在梯度中注入噪声，导致计算效率低且稳定性差，需要一种更高效稳定的多用户本地差分隐私训练机制

Method: 通过稳定化泰勒展开多项式近似模型训练损失函数，对多项式系数添加校准噪声来实现数据隐私化，避免了梯度噪声注入

Result: 在无线体域网场景中，SPOF相比DP-SGD平均重建准确率提高3.5%，训练时间减少57.2%，表现出更好的隐私-效用权衡

Conclusion: SPOF机制在多用户本地差分隐私环境中具有优越性能，计算效率更高，稳定性更好，对环境噪声具有鲁棒性

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

Result: Random Forest和XGBoost模型在所有类别上都达到了高准确度，包括对稀罕故障的检测，而SVM模型对异常的敏感性较低。

Conclusion: 该混合方法提供了稳健的检测能力，具有可扩展性、可解释性和适合实时工业部署的特点，能够支持预防性维护决策。

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RoPE方法需要批量测试样本进行推理，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力。模型错误指定（模拟与真实观测不匹配）是模拟推理的主要挑战。

Method: 使用小批量最优传输与闭式耦合对齐相同潜在参数对应的真实和模拟观测，结合配对校准数据和非配对样本，然后训练条件归一化流来近似最优传输诱导的后验分布。

Result: 在合成和真实基准测试（包括复杂医学生物标志物估计）中，该方法达到或超过了RoPE以及其他标准SBI和非SBI估计器的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个端到端可训练的框架，在具有挑战性的错误指定环境中提供了改进的可扩展性和适用性，无需在测试时访问模拟。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

Motivation: 现有动态主题模型需要一次性处理整个训练语料，而在线主题模型缺乏长期记忆能力，无法在持续学习新数据时保持对先前学习主题的记忆。

Method: 使用全局先验分布持续更新的方法，构建CoNTM模型，能够在后续时间步持续学习主题模型而不遗忘先前内容。

Conclusion: CoNTM填补了持续学习在主题建模领域的空白，提供了一种有效的解决方案，在保持先前知识的同时持续学习新主题。

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

Conclusion: GRASPED通过谱域编码解码架构有效解决了图异常检测中的多尺度信息捕获问题，在无监督设置下取得了优异性能

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseLoCo是一种针对大语言模型的高效通信训练算法，通过Top-k稀疏化和量化技术，在保持性能的同时实现高达1-3%稀疏度和2比特量化的极端压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练算法在带宽受限环境下仍存在通信瓶颈，即使减少通信频率也需要传输完整梯度副本，且性能略低于标准AdamW DDP基准。量化技术在大语言模型预训练中应用有限，无法有效利用稀疏化。

Method: 结合Top-k稀疏化和量化技术，利用外部动量的局部近似和误差反馈，通过稀疏聚合提升模型性能。

Result: 在多种通信受限的大语言模型训练场景中，SparseLoCo在性能和通信成本方面均表现出显著优势，压缩比达到1-3%稀疏度和2比特量化。

Conclusion: SparseLoCo成功解决了大语言模型分布式训练中的通信瓶颈问题，通过极端压缩技术实现了通信效率的显著提升，同时保持甚至超越了全精度方法的性能。

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

Motivation: 尽管似然在理论上是最优的OOD检测器，但实践中经常失败，研究旨在确定这是像素空间的问题还是表示空间也存在密度估计问题。

Method: 训练变分扩散模型在预训练ResNet-18的表示空间上，而不是在图像像素空间上，使用似然作为OOD分数进行评估。

Result: 通过在表示空间中进行实验，评估了基于似然的OOD检测器性能，并与OpenOOD套件中的最先进方法进行比较。

Conclusion: 研究验证了在表示空间中基于似然的OOD检测方法的有效性，为解决像素空间中似然检测失败的问题提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL

competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and

Conclusion: 该方法为连续动作空间的协作多智能体系统提供了一种有效的去中心化对抗攻击检测解决方案，在检测性能方面表现出色。

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical

capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional

and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a

Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于核的Equalized Odds准则EO_k，用于公平表示学习，能够统一量化独立性、分离性和校准性三个核心公平目标，并在有偏和无偏条件下提供理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公平表示学习的目标是在保持预测准确性的同时减少敏感属性带来的歧视，需要一种能够统一分析不同公平准则之间权衡关系的理论框架。

Method: 提出基于核的EO_k准则及其经验估计量EO_k^，推导了浓度不等式提供性能保证和误差界限，可作为公平性合规的实用证明。

Result: EO_k在无偏条件下同时满足独立性和分离性，在有偏条件下在保持预测准确性的同时对独立性和校准性提供下界，统一分析了公平准则间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来经验研究中原则性和可证明公平的算法设计奠定了重要理论基础，提供了实用的公平性合规证明工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel kernel-based formulation of the Equalized Odds
(EO) criterion, denoted as $EO_k$, for fair representation learning (FRL) in
supervised settings. The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination
regarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for
the target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and
interpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence
(prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as
equalized odds; prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on
target attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned
on the prediction $\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$)
and biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both
independence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive
accuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter,
thereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among
these fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart,
$\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time,
with linear-time approximations also available. A concentration inequality for
$\hat{EO}_k$ is derived, providing performance guarantees and error bounds,
which serve as practical certificates of fairness compliance. While our focus
is on theoretical development, the results lay essential groundwork for
principled and provably fair algorithmic design in future empirical studies.

Conclusion: 该框架具有广泛适用性，在三个不同的案例研究中得到验证，包括一个实验数据集，证明了其作为推理和学习通用工具的有效性。

Abstract: Accuracy and generalization capabilities are key objectives when learning
dynamical system models. To obtain such models from limited data, current works
exploit prior knowledge and assumptions about the system. However, the fusion
of diverse prior knowledge, e. g. partially known system equations and
smoothness assumptions about unknown model parts, with information contained in
the data remains a challenging problem, especially in input-output settings
with latent system state. In particular, learning functions that are nested
inside known system equations can be a laborious and error-prone expert task.
This paper considers inference of latent states and learning of unknown model
parts for fusion of data information with different sources of prior knowledge.
The main contribution is a general-purpose system identification tool that, for
the first time, provides a consistent solution for both, online and offline
Bayesian inference and learning while allowing to incorporate explicit and
implicit prior system knowledge. We propose a novel interface for combining
known dynamics functions with a learning-based approximation of unknown system
parts. Based on the proposed model structure, closed-form densities for
efficient parameter marginalization are derived. No user-tailored coordinate
transformations or model inversions are needed, making the presented framework
a general-purpose tool for inference and learning. The broad applicability of
the devised framework is illustrated in three distinct case studies, including
an experimental data set.

Motivation: 预期改善（EI）是贝叶斯优化中广泛使用的获取函数，但其累积悔弃上界理论一直缺失，需要理论分析来支持其实践效果

Method: 分析噪音高斯过程预期改善（GP-EI）算法，考虑三种常用的最佳值选择方式：最佳后验均值（BPMI）、最佳采样后验均值（BSPMI）和最佳观测值（BOI）

Result: 首次提供了GP-EI在BPMI和BSPMI下的累积悔弃上界，证明其在SE和Matérn核下都是无悔弃算法；GP-EI使用BOI时要么达到次线性累积悔弃上界，要么具有快速收敏的噪音简单悔弃上界

Conclusion: 研究给出了GP-EI算法的理论保障，为实践者在噪音环境下选择合适的最佳值提供了理论指导，数值实验验证了相关结论

Abstract: Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition
functions in Bayesian optimization (BO). Despite its proven empirical success
in applications, the cumulative regret upper bound of EI remains an open
question. In this paper, we analyze the classic noisy Gaussian process expected
improvement (GP-EI) algorithm. We consider the Bayesian setting, where the
objective is a sample from a GP. Three commonly used incumbents, namely the
best posterior mean incumbent (BPMI), the best sampled posterior mean incumbent
(BSPMI), and the best observation incumbent (BOI) are considered as the choices
of the current best value in GP-EI. We present for the first time the
cumulative regret upper bounds of GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI. Importantly, we
show that in both cases, GP-EI is a no-regret algorithm for both squared
exponential (SE) and Mat\'ern kernels. Further, we present for the first time
that GP-EI with BOI either achieves a sublinear cumulative regret upper bound
or has a fast converging noisy simple regret bound for SE and Mat\'ern kernels.
Our results provide theoretical guidance to the choice of incumbent when
practitioners apply GP-EI in the noisy setting. Numerical experiments are
conducted to validate our findings.

structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design,
allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for
efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only
involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and
established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural
networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show
that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in
predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact
with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.
