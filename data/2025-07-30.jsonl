Integrating the ability\nof large language models (LLMs) with task-oriented semantic communication is a\npotential approach.

While some recent methods attempt to\ncouple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate\nobjectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit\ntheir expressiveness and robustness.

These\nneighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the\nprompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting\n(DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual\ndetails for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into\ncoarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies\nfor different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields\nand statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective\ncompression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts.\nExperiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates\nwithin a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by\nup to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of\nGraph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection."}

Yet this very nature also\nmakes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML\nmodels, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical\nabstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these\nissues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a\nline of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.\nthe fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we\nanalyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of\nclassification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are\nequivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying\nthe properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their\nboundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By\nparameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that\nthey satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be\nused to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.\nMoreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the\nmulticlass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the\nclass assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce\nnormalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to\nthe law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are\nnecessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic\ninterpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the\nbroader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework."}

However, the existing deep learning approaches cannot explicitly\ncapture the relationship among choice alternatives, which has been a\nlong-lasting focus in classical discrete choice models. To address the gap,\nthis paper introduces Graph Neural Network (GNN) as a novel framework to\nanalyze residential location choice. The GNN-based discrete choice models\n(GNN-DCMs) offer a structured approach for neural networks to capture\ndependence among spatial alternatives, while maintaining clear connections to\nclassical random utility theory. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the\nGNN-DCMs incorporate the nested logit (NL) model and the spatially correlated\nlogit (SCL) model as two specific cases, yielding novel algorithmic\ninterpretation through message passing among alternatives' utilities.\nEmpirically, the GNN-DCMs outperform benchmark MNL, SCL, and feedforward neural\nnetworks in predicting residential location choices among Chicago's 77\ncommunity areas. Regarding model interpretation, the GNN-DCMs can capture\nindividual heterogeneity and exhibit spatially-aware substitution patterns.\nOverall, these results highlight the potential of GNN-DCMs as a unified and\nexpressive framework for synergizing discrete choice modeling and deep learning\nin the complex spatial choice contexts."}

While\nrecent work has established that GD converges to a stationary point at a\nsublinear rate within locally quasi-convex regions (LQCRs), this fails to\nexplain the exponential convergence rates consistently observed in practice. In\nthis paper, we resolve this discrepancy by proving that under a mild assumption\non Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) stability, these same regions satisfy a local\nPolyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. We introduce the concept of a Locally\nPolyak-Lojasiewicz Region (LPLR), where the squared gradient norm lower-bounds\nthe suboptimality gap, prove that properly initialized finite-width networks\nadmit such regions around initialization, and establish that GD achieves linear\nconvergence within an LPLR, providing the first finite-width guarantee that\nmatches empirically observed rates. We validate our theory across diverse\nsettings, from controlled experiments on fully-connected networks to modern\nResNet architectures trained with stochastic methods, demonstrating that LPLR\nstructure emerges robustly in practical deep learning scenarios. By rigorously\nconnecting local landscape geometry to fast optimization through the NTK\nframework, our work provides a definitive theoretical explanation for the\nremarkable efficiency of gradient-based optimization in deep learning."}

While powerful Stein-based\ndiagnostics can detect distributional mismatches, they provide no direct\nassessment of dependence structure, often the primary inferential target in\nmultivariate problems. We introduce the Copula Discrepancy (CD), a principled\nand computationally efficient diagnostic that leverages Sklar's theorem to\nisolate and quantify the fidelity of a sample's dependence structure\nindependent of its marginals. Our theoretical framework provides the first\nstructure-aware diagnostic specifically designed for the era of approximate\ninference. Empirically, we demonstrate that a moment-based CD dramatically\noutperforms standard diagnostics like effective sample size for hyperparameter\nselection in biased MCMC, correctly identifying optimal configurations where\ntraditional methods fail. Furthermore, our robust MLE-based variant can detect\nsubtle but critical mismatches in tail dependence that remain invisible to rank\ncorrelation-based approaches, distinguishing between samples with identical\nKendall's tau but fundamentally different extreme-event behavior. With\ncomputational overhead orders of magnitude lower than existing Stein\ndiscrepancies, the CD provides both immediate practical value for MCMC\npractitioners and a theoretical foundation for the next generation of\nstructure-aware sample quality assessment."}

This non-parametric result, which follows from fundamental\nproperties of order statistics, holds regardless of the underlying\ndistribution's shape.

Yet, in practice, analyses are often\ncomplicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address\nmissingness is multiple imputation, which creates several completed datasets.\nHowever, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the\npresence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling\nmodels across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although\nmore sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and\ntherefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the\nregularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss\nfunction, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our\nkey contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise\ngradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a\nuniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets.
