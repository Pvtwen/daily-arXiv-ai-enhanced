We propose a combined manifold and machine\nlearning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent\ncrowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The\nproposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation\nEquation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and\nmultiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the\nmass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first\nstep, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete\nmicroscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based\non manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space\ninto the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the\ncorresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning\nreduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning\ntechniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the\ncrowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density\nprofiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density\ndistribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this \"embed->learn in latent\nspace->lift back to the ambient space\" pipeline, we create an effective\nsolution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.\nFor our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a\ncorridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical\nresults demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus\nallowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from\nagent-based simulations."}

We identify that the root issue lies in\nthe long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently\nsensitive to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue and bridge the\nresearch gap, in this paper, we propose a Heterogeneity-invariant Personalized\nFederated learning scheme, named FedHiP, through analytical (i.e., closed-form)\nsolutions to avoid gradient-based updates. Specifically, we exploit the trend\nof self-supervised pre-training, leveraging a foundation model as a frozen\nbackbone for gradient-free feature extraction. Following the feature extractor,\nwe further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To\nsupport both collective generalization and individual personalization, our\nFedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic\nglobal aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form\nsolutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity\ninvariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless\nof how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients.

Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets\nshow the improvement of the presented methods over the state-of-the-art and the\npracticality of the confidence intervals presented."}

In this structure, $\\pi' \\leq \\pi$ if data\ncollected under $\\pi$ can be used to estimate the performance of $\\pi'$,\nenabling counterfactual inference without additional environment interaction.\nLeveraging this partial order, we show that our algorithm achieves a regret\nbound of $O(\\sqrt{w \\log(|\\Theta|) T})$, where $w$ is the width of the partial\norder. Notably, the bound is independent of the state and action space sizes.\nWe illustrate the applicability of these partial orders in many domains in\noperations research, including inventory control and queuing systems. For each,\nwe apply our framework to that problem, yielding new theoretical guarantees and\nstrong empirical results without imposing extra assumptions such as convexity\nin the inventory model or specialized arrival-rate structure in the queuing\nmodel."}

In\ncontrast to traditional AF frameworks that emphasize explicit cost function\ndesign, the proposed framework shifts the paradigm toward direct gradient\nacquisition. The DNN, functioning as a universal nonlinear operator, is\nstructurally embedded into the core architecture of the AF system, establishing\na direct mapping between filtering residuals and learning gradients. The\nmaximum likelihood is adopted as the implicit cost function, rendering the\nderived algorithm inherently data-driven and thus endowed with exemplary\ngeneralization capability, which is validated by extensive numerical\nexperiments across a spectrum of non-Gaussian scenarios. Corresponding mean\nvalue and mean square stability analyses are also conducted in detail."}

However, in the common setting where CV is used to compare two\nalgorithms, it becomes necessary to consider a notion of relative stability\nwhich cannot easily be derived from existing stability results, even for simple\nalgorithms. To better understand relative stability and when CV provides valid\nconfidence intervals for the test error difference of two algorithms, we study\nthe soft-thresholded least squares algorithm, a close cousin of the Lasso. We\nprove that while stability holds when assessing the individual test error of\nthis algorithm, relative stability fails to hold when comparing the test error\nof two such algorithms, even in a sparse low-dimensional linear model setting.\nAdditionally, we empirically confirm the invalidity of CV confidence intervals\nfor the test error difference when either soft-thresholding or the Lasso is\nused. In short, caution is needed when quantifying the uncertainty of CV\nestimates of the performance difference of two machine learning algorithms,\neven when both algorithms are individually stable."}
