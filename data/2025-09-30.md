### [1] [Generative Modeling and Decision Fusion for Unknown Event Detection and Classification Using Synchrophasor Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22795)
*Yi Hu,Zheyuan Cheng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合生成建模、滑动窗口处理和决策融合的电力系统事件检测与分类框架，能够识别已知事件并将未知扰动分类为新类别，解决了监督分类器对罕见事件泛化能力不足的问题。

Conclusion: 该框架具有适应性和实用价值，能够解决监督分类器在广域事件分析中的关键局限性，为现代电力系统提供了强大的事件检测和分类能力。

Abstract: Reliable detection and classification of power system events are critical for
maintaining grid stability and situational awareness. Existing approaches often
depend on limited labeled datasets, which restricts their ability to generalize
to rare or unseen disturbances. This paper proposes a novel framework that
integrates generative modeling, sliding-window temporal processing, and
decision fusion to achieve robust event detection and classification using
synchrophasor data. A variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network is
employed to model normal operating conditions, where both reconstruction error
and discriminator error are extracted as anomaly indicators. Two complementary
decision strategies are developed: a threshold-based rule for computational
efficiency and a convex hull-based method for robustness under complex error
distributions. These features are organized into spatiotemporal detection and
classification matrices through a sliding-window mechanism, and an
identification and decision fusion stage integrates the outputs across PMUs.
This design enables the framework to identify known events while systematically
classifying previously unseen disturbances into a new category, addressing a
key limitation of supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing machine learning, deep learning, and
envelope-based baselines. The ability to recognize unknown events further
highlights the adaptability and practical value of the proposed approach for
wide-area event analysis in modern power systems.

*Jianheng Zhou,Chenyu Liu,Jinan Zhou,Yi Ding,Yang Liu,Haoran Luo,Ziyu Jia,Xinliang Zhou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的睡眠分期方法，将一维PSG信号转换为二维波形图像，利用多模态大模型模拟临床诊断实践，在三个公开数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动睡眠分期方法通常从复杂的PSG信号中提取特征并训练领域特定模型，缺乏直观性且需要大量专业数据集。

Method: 将原始一维PSG时间序列转换为直观的二维波形图像，然后微调多模态大模型从这些表示中学习。

Result: 在三个公共数据集(ISRUC、MASS、SHHS)上的实验表明，该方法使通用模型无需事先接触睡眠数据即可获得稳健的分期能力，且解释分析显示模型学会了模仿人类专家通过PSG图像进行视觉诊断的工作流程。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进的基线方法，突显了其在医疗应用中的效率和实用价值。

Abstract: Sleep staging is essential for diagnosing sleep disorders and assessing
neurological health. Existing automatic methods typically extract features from
complex polysomnography (PSG) signals and train domain-specific models, which
often lack intuitiveness and require large, specialized datasets. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm for sleep staging that leverages
large multimodal general-purpose models to emulate clinical diagnostic
practices. Specifically, we convert raw one-dimensional PSG time-series into
intuitive two-dimensional waveform images and then fine-tune a multimodal large
model to learn from these representations. Experiments on three public datasets
(ISRUC, MASS, SHHS) demonstrate that our approach enables general-purpose
models, without prior exposure to sleep data, to acquire robust staging
capabilities. Moreover, explanation analysis reveals our model learned to mimic
the visual diagnostic workflow of human experts for sleep staging by PSG
images. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in accuracy and robustness, highlighting its efficiency and practical value for
medical applications. The code for the signal-to-image pipeline and the PSG
image dataset will be released.

### [3] [Scalable Wi-Fi RSS-Based Indoor Localization via Automatic Vision-Assisted Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22869)
*Abdulkadir Bilge,Erdem Ergen,Burak Soner,Sinem Coleri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级框架，通过摄像头辅助的短时校准阶段自动收集高分辨率同步RSS-位置数据，用于训练可移动部署的Wi-Fi定位算法，解决了传统RSS方法对多径效应敏感和标记数据收集成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi定位在室内环境中具有可扩展性和隐私保护优势，但RSS方法易受多径效应、信道变化和接收器特性影响，而监督学习方法需要大量标记数据，收集成本高昂。

Method: 使用单次校准的顶置摄像头跟踪设备，收集附近接入点广播包的RSS数据，自动生成(x, y, RSS)数据集，用于训练移动可部署的定位算法。

Result: 量化了视觉辅助RSS数据收集在跟踪精度和标签同步等关键因素下的精度限制，在不同信号条件和设备类型下验证了传统和监督学习方法的性能，展示了改进的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为实际应用提供了实用价值，所有代码、工具和数据集均已开源发布。

Abstract: Wi-Fi-based positioning promises a scalable and privacy-preserving solution
for location-based services in indoor environments such as malls, airports, and
campuses. RSS-based methods are widely deployable as RSS data is available on
all Wi-Fi-capable devices, but RSS is highly sensitive to multipath, channel
variations, and receiver characteristics. While supervised learning methods
offer improved robustness, they require large amounts of labeled data, which is
often costly to obtain. We introduce a lightweight framework that solves this
by automating high-resolution synchronized RSS-location data collection using a
short, camera-assisted calibration phase. An overhead camera is calibrated only
once with ArUco markers and then tracks a device collecting RSS data from
broadcast packets of nearby access points across Wi-Fi channels. The resulting
(x, y, RSS) dataset is used to automatically train mobile-deployable
localization algorithms, avoiding the privacy concerns of continuous video
monitoring. We quantify the accuracy limits of such vision-assisted RSS data
collection under key factors such as tracking precision and label
synchronization. Using the collected experimental data, we benchmark
traditional and supervised learning approaches under varying signal conditions
and device types, demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization,
validating the utility of the proposed framework for practical use. All code,
tools, and datasets are released as open source.

### [4] [Time-Frequency Analysis of Non-Uniformly Sampled Signals via Sample Density Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22891)
*Ashwini Kulkarni,Santosh Nannuru*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了非均匀Stockwell变换(NUST)，一种直接处理非均匀采样数据的时频分析方法，通过双重自适应窗口在频率和局部数据密度上调整窗口宽度，有效检测瞬态和持续信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非均匀采样数据中的非平稳信号分析具有挑战性，现有方法如广义Lomb-Scargle周期图对瞬态事件不敏感，而传统时频方法依赖固定窗口或插值，对非均匀数据效果不佳。

Method: NUST采用局部密度自适应谱分析，使用双重自适应窗口，窗口宽度根据频率和局部数据密度动态调整，直接应用于非均匀采样数据。

Result: 在多个非均匀采样合成信号上验证了NUST的优越时域定位性能，相比GLS方法表现更佳。应用于HD 10180多行星系统的HARPS径向速度数据，成功区分了相干行星信号和恒星活动。

Conclusion: NUST为非均匀采样数据的时频分析提供了有效框架，能够同时检测瞬态和持续信号，在行星探测和恒星活动分析中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The analysis of non-stationary signals in non-uniformly sampled data is a
challenging task. Time-integrated methods, such as the generalised Lomb-Scargle
(GLS) periodogram, provide a robust statistical assessment of persistent
periodicities but are insensitive to transient events. Conversely, existing
time-frequency methods often rely on fixed-duration windows or interpolation,
which can be suboptimal for non-uniform data. We introduce the non-uniform
Stockwell-transform (NUST), a time-frequency framework that applies a localized
density adaptive spectral analysis directly to non-uniformly sampled data. NUST
employs a doubly adaptive window that adjusts its width based on both frequency
and local data density, providing detailed time-frequency information for both
transient and persistent signals. We validate the NUST on numerous
non-uniformly sampled synthetic signals, demonstrating its superior
time-localization performance compared to GLS. Furthermore, we apply NUST to
HARPS radial velocity data of the multi-planetary system HD 10180, successfully
distinguishing coherent planetary signals from stellar activity.

### [5] [Resource Allocation in Cooperative Mid-band/THz Networks in the Presence of Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23065)
*Mohammad Amin Saeidi,Hina Tabassum*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个优化多频段网络下行性能的综合框架，结合上中频和太赫兹频段，通过联合用户关联和混合波束成形来最大化系统总速率，并考虑移动用户的切换感知资源分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无线通信向更高频段发展，需要解决多频段协作网络中的性能优化问题，特别是考虑近场信道建模、不同天线架构和用户移动性等复杂因素。

Method: 使用分数规划和主化最小化技术提出迭代算法解决非凸优化问题；针对移动用户提出两种切换感知资源分配方法，利用Jensen不等式和对数函数特性将非凸问题转化为凸问题求解。

Result: 数值结果表明所提算法有效，协作UMB/THz网络优于独立THz网络，准确近场建模在超大天线阵列中至关重要，切换感知方法能有效减轻切换影响。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和算法成功优化了协作多频段网络性能，切换感知资源分配显著提升了移动用户的系统性能。

Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive framework to investigate and optimize the
downlink performance of cooperative multi-band networks (MBNs) operating on
upper mid-band (UMB) and terahertz (THz) frequencies, where base stations (BSs)
in each band cooperatively serve users. The framework captures sophisticated
features such as near-field channel modeling, fully and partially connected
antenna architectures, and users' mobility. First, we consider joint user
association and hybrid beamforming optimization to maximize the system
sum-rate, subject to power constraints, maximum cluster size of cooperating
BSs, and users' quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By leveraging fractional
programming FP and majorization-minimization techniques, an iterative algorithm
is proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem. We then consider
handover (HO)-aware resource allocation for moving users in a cooperative
UMB/THz MBN. Two HO-aware resource allocation methods are proposed. The first
method focuses on maximizing the HO-aware system sum-rate subject to HO-aware
QoS constraints. Using Jensen's inequality and properties of logarithmic
functions, the non-convex optimization problem is tightly approximated with a
convex one and solved. The second method addresses a multi-objective
optimization problem to maximize the system sum-rate, while minimizing the
total number of HOs. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
algorithms, cooperative UMB/THz MBN over stand-alone THz networks, as well as
the critical importance of accurate near-field modeling in extremely large
antenna arrays. Moreover, the proposed HO-aware resource allocation methods
effectively mitigate the impact of HOs, enhancing performance in the considered
system.

### [6] [Dual-Function Beam Pattern Design for Multi-Target ISAC Systems: A Decoupled Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23302)
*Wilson de Souza Junior,Taufik Abrao,Amine Mezghani,Ekram Hossain*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于单基地多用户多点目标ISAC系统的波束图设计方法，通过分解感知问题并利用波束图物理特性，在保证通信性能的同时提升多目标估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在ISAC系统中，感知和通信竞争资源，传统联合优化方法往往忽视这种权衡，导致通信需求增加时波束图变形，进而降低DoA感知精度。

Method: 将感知问题分解为两个子问题，提出SGCDF波束图设计，并开发基于黎曼流形优化和凸闭集投影的低复杂度扩展版本。

Result: 仿真结果表明，与传统联合优化相比，所提方法通过保持波束图特性提高了多目标估计精度，低复杂度版本在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: SGCDF方法有效解决了ISAC系统中感知与通信的权衡问题，低复杂度版本提供了优异的性能-复杂度权衡，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We investigate the beampattern design problem for mono-static multi-user (MU)
multi-point-target integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where a
dual-function multiple-input multiple-output (DF-MIMO) base station (BS)
performs downlink communication and radar sensing simultaneously. In ISAC
systems, sensing and communication inherently compete for resources. As
communication demand increases, the beam pattern is reshaped, which might
degrade the direction of arrival (DoA) sensing accuracy, measured in terms of
mean-squared error (MSE) and lower-bounded by the Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB). Since conventional joint formulations of the sensing-based problem
often overlook this trade-off, our work addresses it by decomposing the
sensing-based problem into two subproblems (SPs). This decomposition enables a
more effective exploitation of the beam pattern's physical properties, which we
refer to as the Sensing-Guided Communication Dual-Function (SGCDF) beam pattern
design. We further develop a low-complexity extension using the Riemannian
Manifold Optimization (RMO) and convex closed-set projection. Simulation
results confirm that the proposed method improves multi-target estimation
accuracy, compared to traditional joint optimization strategies, by preserving
the beam pattern, while the low-complexity version offers an excellent
performance-complexity tradeoff, maintaining high accuracy with significantly
reduced computational cost.

### [7] [HoloTrace: a Location Privacy Preservation Solution for mmWave MIMO-OFDM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23444)
*Lorenzo Italiano,Alireza Pourafzal,Hui Chen,Mattia Brambilla,Gonzalo Seco-Granados,Monica Nicoli,Henk Wymeersch*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: HoloTrace是一个信号级隐私保护框架，通过在用户端欺骗定位相关特征来防止基站从毫米波MIMO-OFDM信号中提取精确位置信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G蜂窝网络技术发展带来了前所未有的用户设备定位能力，但也引发了物理层位置隐私的严重担忧，需要防止基站进行非自愿的用户定位。

Method: 用户通过在角度到达、角度离开和到达时间差等位置参数上进行欺骗，战略性地扰动导频传输，将欺骗建模为统一的秩约束投影问题，并提供闭式解。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法能有效欺骗基站，诱导显著定位误差，而对链路容量的影响取决于欺骗位置。

Conclusion: HoloTrace是未来6G网络中实用且鲁棒的隐私保护解决方案，无需协议修改或网络侧支持。

Abstract: The technological innovation towards 6G cellular networks introduces
unprecedented capabilities for user equipment (UE) localization, but it also
raises serious concerns about physical layer location privacy. This paper
introduces HoloTrace, a signal-level privacy preservation framework that relies
on user-side spoofing of localization-relevant features to prevent the
extraction of precise location information from the signals received by a base
station (BS) in a mmWave MIMO-OFDM system. Spoofing is performed by the user on
location parameters such as angle of arrival (AoA), angle of departure (AoD),
and time difference of arrival (TDoA). Without requiring any protocol
modification nor network-side support, our method strategically perturbs pilot
transmissions to prevent a BS from performing non-consensual UE localization.
The methodology allows the UE to spoof its position, keeping the precoder
unchanged. We formulate spoofing as a unified rank-constrained projection
problem, and provide closed-form solutions under varying levels of channel
state information (CSI) at the UE, including scenarios with and without CSI
knowledge. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach enables the UE
to deceive the BS, inducing significant localization errors, while the impact
on link capacity varies depending on the spoofed position. Our findings
establish HoloTrace as a practical and robust privacy-preserving solution for
future 6G networks.

### [8] [Theoretical framework of passive ME antenna arrays enabling in-vivo monitoring: A pathway to smart implants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23520)
*Kalpesh Jaykar,Prasanth Velvaluri,Nian X. Sun,Richard D. James*

Main category: eess.SP

Conclusion: 磁电天线阵列技术为血管内植入物提供了一种有效的信号增强方案，有望改善脑机接口的通信性能。

Abstract: A new brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, deployed through minimally
invasive surgery, is changing the way we think about treating severe
neurological conditions. The central idea is to place a device called Stentrode
in the brain's vasculature, which enables neuromodulation and helps patients
regain the ability to communicate. However, in such devices, the battery and
electronics are wired and could introduce damage or implant malfunction. In
these cases, a Stentrode integrated with magnetoelectric (ME) antennas could be
of great interest. ME antennas offer significant advantages over traditional
antennas, leveraging acoustic resonance rather than electromagnetic resonance
to achieve a size reduction of up to five orders of magnitude. In addition to
their compactness and immunity to ground-plane interference, ME antennas could
be adopted for use in vascular implants, such as coronary stents, potentially
enabling minimally invasive monitoring and communication. Despite these
advantages, a single antenna embedded in the implant may be constrained by the
limited volume of magnetostrictive material, which could result in low output
gain. To address this gain limitation, we propose using antenna arrays designed
to produce constructive interference at a designated far-field point, ideally
located outside the patient, to enhance signal transmission and receiving
capabilities. We develop a mathematical model to represent the antennas and
optimize their spatial arrangement and phase synchronization. Simulations based
on this model demonstrate promising high-gain performance at the prescribed
far-field location through phase manipulation.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可学习核的FRI采样重建框架，通过联合优化采样核和重建编码器，在降低采样率的同时提高了分辨率和噪声鲁棒性，并实现了硬件实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FRI重建方法依赖预定义核，限制了硬件实现和在噪声条件下的重建精度，需要更灵活、鲁棒且可实际实现的框架。

Method: 首先使用截断高斯和高斯对核进行有效重建，然后通过统一学习方法联合优化采样核和重建编码器，最后用两个指数衰减信号的和表示核以实现硬件实现。

Result: 实验验证通过Sallen-Key模拟滤波器硬件实现，实现了准确的实际信号恢复，基于CNN的编码器显著降低了计算复杂度，在较少参数下表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法特别适合资源受限的边缘部署，提供了高效、鲁棒且可实际实现的FRI重建解决方案。

Abstract: Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) sampling techniques provide efficient
frameworks for reconstructing signals with inherent sparsity at rates below
Nyquist. However, traditional FRI reconstruction methods rely heavily on
pre-defined kernels, often limiting hardware implementation and reconstruction
accuracy under noisy conditions. In this paper, we propose a robust, flexible,
and practically implementable framework for FRI reconstruction by introducing
novel learnable kernel strategies. First, we demonstrate effective
reconstruction using known, fixed kernels such as truncated Gaussian and
Gaussian pair kernels, which mitigate the requirement that the samples should
have a sum-of-exponentials (SoE) form. Next, we extend this concept by jointly
optimizing both the sampling kernel and reconstruction encoder through a
unified learning approach, yielding adaptive kernels that significantly
outperform traditional methods in resolution and noise robustness, with reduced
sampling rates. Furthermore, we propose a practical hardware realization by
representing kernels as sums of two exponential decay signals with jointly
optimized poles, facilitating compact, efficient analog implementations. Our
approach is validated experimentally through hardware implementations using a
unity-gain Sallen-Key analog filter, achieving accurate real-world signal
recovery. The developed convolutional neural network-based encoder
substantially reduces computational complexity, demonstrating competitive
performance with fewer parameters, making our method particularly suitable for
resource-constrained, edge-based deployments.

Conclusion: 该框架为多无人机网络提供了安全高效的ISAC解决方案，通过联合优化波束成形和轨迹设计实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a key enabler for
next-generation applications such as smart cities and autonomous systems. Its
integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) unlocks new potentials for
reliable communication and precise sensing in dynamic aerial environments.
However, existing research predominantly treats UAVs as aerial base stations,
overlooking their role as ISAC users, and fails to leverage large-scale antenna
arrays at terrestrial base stations to enhance security and spectral
efficiency. This paper propose a secure and spectral efficient ISAC framework
for multi-UAV networks, and a two-stage optimization approach is developed to
jointly design hybrid beamforming (HBF), artificial noise (AN) injection, and
UAV trajectories. Aiming at maximizing the sum secrecy rate, the first stage
employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize digital beamformers and
trajectories, and the second stage decomposes the digital solution into analog
and digital components via low-complexity matrix factorization. Simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to
benchmark schemes.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于期望传播的重叠块分区检测器(OvEP)，用于解决大规模MIMO系统中高度相关信道矩阵导致的检测性能下降问题。通过将测量向量划分为部分重叠的块，设计低复杂度LMMSE滤波器，并减去重叠部分输出来抑制块间相关性影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模MIMO系统在密集阵列部署和有限散射环境下，信道矩阵高度相关且病态，严重降低基于消息传递的检测器性能。需要开发能有效处理这种相关性的高效检测算法。

Method: 将大规模测量向量划分为部分重叠的块，为每个块及其重叠部分设计低复杂度LMMSE滤波器。通过减去重叠部分输出来组合LMMSE输出，有效缓解高空间相关性引起的块间相关性的不利影响。

Result: 所提算法在EP框架下一致推导，其固定点理论上被证明与松弛KL最小化问题的驻点重合。数值仿真进一步阐明了理论预测性能改进的机制，实现了接近传统LMMSE-EP的性能，但计算复杂度更低。

Conclusion: OvEP检测器通过重叠块分区和LMMSE滤波器设计，有效解决了大规模MIMO系统中信道相关性问题，在保持接近传统方法性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems typically operate
in dense array deployments with limited scattering environments, leading to
highly correlated and ill-conditioned channel matrices that severely degrade
the performance of message-passing-based detectors. To tackle this issue, this
paper proposes an expectation propagation (EP)-based detector, termed
overlapping block partitioning EP (OvEP). In OvEP, the large-scale measurement
vector is partitioned into partially overlapping blocks. For each block and its
overlapping part, a low-complexity linear minimum mean square error
(LMMSE)-based filter is designed according to the partitioned structure. The
resulting LMMSE outputs are then combined to generate the input to the
denoiser. In this combining process, subtracting the overlapping-part outputs
from the block outputs effectively mitigates the adverse effects of inter-block
correlation induced by high spatial correlation. The proposed algorithm is
consistently derived within the EP framework, and its fixed point is
theoretically proven to coincide with the stationary point of a relaxed
Kullback- Leibler (KL) minimization problem. The mechanisms underlying the
theoretically predicted performance improvement are further clarified through
numerical simulations. The proposed algorithm achieves performance close to
conventional LMMSE-EP with lower computational complexity.

### [12] [Online Specific Emitter Identification via Collision-Alleviated Signal Hash](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23807)
*Hongyu Wang,Wenjia Xu,Guangzuo Li,Siyuan Wan,Yaohua Sun,Jiuniu Wang,Mugen Peng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了在线特定发射器识别（OSEI）任务，包含在线少样本和广义零样本学习任务，并提出了基于哈希的CASH模型来解决该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中需要识别之前未见的新发射器信号，而现有模型难以在线识别新发射器信号且偏向于已见发射器分布。

Method: 提出CASH模型，包含两个步骤：已见发射器识别步骤确定信号是否来自已见发射器，信号哈希编码步骤为每个信号样本分配哈希码以识别特定发射器。

Result: 在真实世界信号数据集（ADSB和ORACLE）上的实验表明，该方法能准确在线识别已见和新发射器信号，在少样本和广义零样本学习任务中分别比现有方法准确率至少提高6.08%和8.55%。

Conclusion: CASH模型为OSEI任务提供了统一的解决方案，能有效识别已见和新发射器信号，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) has been widely studied, aiming to
distinguish signals from different emitters given training samples from those
emitters. However, real-world scenarios often require identifying signals from
novel emitters previously unseen. Since these novel emitters only have a few or
no prior samples, existing models struggle to identify signals from novel
emitters online and tend to bias toward the distribution of seen emitters. To
address these challenges, we propose the Online Specific Emitter Identification
(OSEI) task, comprising both online \revise{few-shot and generalized zero-shot}
learning tasks. It requires constructing models using signal samples from seen
emitters and then identifying new samples from seen and novel emitters online
during inference. We propose a novel hash-based model, Collision-Alleviated
Signal Hash (CASH), providing a unified approach for addressing the OSEI task.
The CASH operates in two steps: in the seen emitters identifying step, a signal
encoder and a seen emitters identifier determine whether the signal sample is
from seen emitters, mitigating the model from biasing toward seen emitters
distribution. In the signal hash coding step, an online signal hasher assigns a
hash code to each signal sample, identifying its specific emitter. Experimental
results on real-world signal datasets (i.e., ADSB and ORACLE) demonstrate that
our method accurately identifies signals from both seen and novel emitters
online. This model outperforms existing methods by a minimum of 6.08\% and
8.55\% in accuracy for the few-shot and \revise{generalized zero-shot learning
}tasks, respectively. The code will be open-sourced at

*Masahiro Kurisaki*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于系统噪声小参数的渐近展开非线性滤波方法，通过级数展开和常微分方程求解系数，在计算效率和精度间取得平衡，并能捕捉多峰等复杂分布特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有非线性滤波方法（如高斯近似和粒子滤波）在计算效率和精度之间的权衡问题，同时能够以较低计算成本捕捉条件分布的复杂特征。

Method: 基于系统噪声小参数的渐近展开方法，将条件期望展开为噪声水平的幂级数，通过求解常微分方程组计算各系数，并引入Edgeworth型展开。

Result: 该方法在计算效率和精度之间取得了更好的平衡，能够以显著低于传统滤波算法的计算成本捕捉条件分布的复杂特征（如多峰性）。

Conclusion: 所提出的渐近展开方法为非线性滤波提供了一种有效解决方案，在保持计算效率的同时提高了精度，并能处理复杂的分布特征。

Abstract: We propose a new asymptotic expansion method for nonlinear filtering, based
on a small parameter in the system noise. The conditional expectation is
expanded as a power series in the noise level, with each coefficient computed
by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. This approach mitigates
the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy inherent in
existing methods such as Gaussian approximations and particle filters.
Moreover, by incorporating an Edgeworth-type expansion, our method captures
complex features of the conditional distribution, such as multimodality, with

Abstract: In integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), a distinguishing feature of
6G wireless networks, the main challenge lies in integrating the two distinct
functions of sensing and communication within the same waveform. In this paper,
the ISAC waveform synthesis is studied in the wideband regime, since a large
bandwidth can simplify the analysis and is justified by the employment of
millimeter wave or higher frequency band. Standard orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) signaling is assumed, and the wideband analysis of
sensing is a counterpart of the existing studies on wideband communications. It
is proposed that the phase over such OFDM subcarriers is for modulating
communication messages while the power spectral density (PSD) is shaped for the
sensing performance. Beyond OFDM, we further reveal a duality between the
proposed PSD-shaping rule and the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)
waveform. Flattening the OTFS delay-axis PSD produces the same integrated
sidelobe level (ISL) reduction effect in the delay-Doppler domain as PSD
control achieves for OFDM in the frequency domain. To balance communication and
sensing performance over frequency-selective channels, we propose a
low-complexity, water-filling-like allocator with an explicit PSD-flatness
(variance) constraint. The performance of the proposed wideband ISAC scheme is
demonstrated using both numerical simulations and hardware experiments.

Abstract: Bladder pressure monitoring systems are increasingly vital in diagnosing and
managing urinary tract dysfunction. Existing solutions rely heavily on
hand-crafted features and shallow classifiers, limiting their adaptability to
complex signal dynamics. We propose a one-layer streaming transformer model for
real-time classification of bladder pressure states, operating on
wavelet-transformed representations of raw time-series data. Our model
incorporates temporal multi-head self-attention and state caching, enabling
efficient online inference with high adaptability. Trained on a dataset of 91

TL;DR: 提出了Uni-NTFM，一种基于神经科学原理设计的统一神经拓扑基础模型，用于处理脑电图信号，解决了现有方法在时间-频率特征混淆、电极空间拓扑忽略和网络灵活性不足等问题。

Motivation: 现有脑基础模型继承文本或图像架构，存在三个限制：1) 在单一处理流中混淆时域波形和频域节律特征；2) 忽略不同标准电极的关键空间拓扑；3) 依赖不灵活的密集网络处理功能不同的EEG模式。

Conclusion: Uni-NTFM展示了学习脑活动通用表示的卓越能力，为EEG信号处理提供了新的基础模型解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated
significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to
electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique
properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures
designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1)
conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic
features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial
topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the
inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological
Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles
to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates
three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time,
frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain
feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes
from different international standards and generate structured input sequences
for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that
efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized
subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B
parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a
dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms
existing task-specific methods and foundation models across nine distinct
downstream tasks under both linear probing and fine-tuning settings,
demonstrating a superior ability to learn universal representations of brain
activity.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), capable of dynamically controlling
wireless propagation characteristics using reflecting antenna elements, is a
promising technology for enhancing signal coverage and improving end-user
connectivity in next-generation wireless networks. This paper presents a
complete design flow of a modular RIS prototype operating at the n78 frequency
band, starting from the simulations to the prototype development and testing.
An RIS prototype includes one master and up to sixteen slave blocks, each of
which has an identical hardware structure with $8\times 8$ reflecting surface
elements and a controller board. The phase shift response of each unit element
is controlled with a PIN diode to form a $180^\circ$ phase difference between
the ON and OFF states. The measurement experiment using two RIS blocks, horn
antennas, and a vector network analyzer showed that the improvement of the
received signal power is more than $15$ dB across the n78 frequency band for a
given placement.

Abstract: The problem of recovering a mixture of spike signals convolved with distinct
point spread functions (PSFs) lying on a parametric manifold, under the
assumption that the spike locations are known, is studied. The PSF unmixing
problem is formulated as a projected non-linear least squares estimator. A
lower bound on the radius of the region of strong convexity is established in
the presence of noise as a function of the manifold coherence and Lipschitz
properties, guaranteeing convergence and stability of the optimization program.
Numerical experiments highlight the speed of decay of the PSF class in the
problem's conditioning and confirm theoretical findings. Finally, the proposed
estimator is deployed on real-world spectroscopic data from laser-induced
breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), removing the need for manual calibration and
validating the method's practical relevance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无线多端口传感中当可访问天线的独立测量数量不足时，无法解嵌入OTA夹具以恢复DUT特性的问题。

Method: 使用可调负载网络(TLN)连接OTA夹具构成可编程夹具(PF)，通过多个PF实现提供测量多样性，实现"多路解嵌入"。

Result: 实验成功通过30个不同PF实现，仅基于两个可访问天线之间的单个传输系数测量，远程估计了互易非酉4端口DUT的散射矩阵(10个复值未知数)。

Conclusion: 多路解嵌入方法为在RFID和无线生物电子等领域实现低硬件复杂度的无线多端口传感铺平了道路。

Abstract: Wireless multi-port sensing remotely retrieves the scattering matrix of a
multi-port device under test (DUT) connected to a set of
not-directly-accessible (NDA) antennas that couple over-the-air (OTA) to a set
of accessible antennas. If (i) the OTA fixture characteristics are known, and
(ii) the number of independent measurements at the accessible antennas is
sufficient, the OTA fixture can be de-embedded to recover the DUT
characteristics. In recent prior work, we solved (i) by connecting the NDA
antennas to a specific known tunable load network (TLN). Here, we tackle (ii)
by additionally using the TLN to provide measurement diversity. The connection
between OTA fixture and TLN constitutes a programmable fixture (PF). When the
DUT characteristics cannot be identified based on a single PF realization, we
add measurement diversity with multiple PF realizations. The underlying
"multiplexed de-embedding" achieves the joint de-embedding of an ensemble of PF
realizations when a single PF realization cannot be de-embedded. We
experimentally demonstrate our concept by remotely estimating the scattering
matrix of a reciprocal, non-unitary 4-port DUT (10 complex-valued unknowns) via
a rich-scattering OTA fixture purely based on measurements of a single
transmission coefficient between two accessible antennas across 30 different PF
realizations. We systematically study the trade-off between the number of
independent measurements at the accessible antennas and the number of PF
realizations. Multiplexed de-embedding of the OTA fixture paves the path to
implementing wireless multi-port sensing with low hardware complexity in areas
like RFID and wireless bioelectronics.

Result: 真实数据评估显示，BARProp定位精度更高，收敛速度比现有方法快至少4倍，内存使用减少85%以上。

Conclusion: BARProp为RSS室内定位提供了高效实用的解决方案，在精度、速度和内存效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Leveraging received signal strength (RSS) measurements for indoor
localization is highly attractive due to their inherent availability in
ubiquitous wireless protocols. However, prevailing RSS-based methods often
depend on complex computational algorithms or specialized hardware, rendering
them impractical for low-cost access points. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces buffer-aided RMSProp (BARProp), a fast and memory-efficient
localization algorithm specifically designed for RSS-based tasks. The key
innovation of BARProp lies in a novel mechanism that dynamically adapts the
decay factor by monitoring the energy variations of recent gradients stored in
a buffer, thereby achieving both accelerated convergence and enhanced
stability. Furthermore, BARProp requires less than 15% of the memory used by
state-of-the-art methods. Extensive evaluations with real-world data
demonstrate that BARProp not only achieves higher localization accuracy but
also delivers at least a fourfold improvement in convergence speed compared to
existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Optimizing sensor readout schemes and integrated circuit designs for both
open-loop and closed-loop implementations requires precise modeling and
simulation strategies. This study introduces a novel two-port impedance model
to estimate the behavior of a converse Magnetoelectric (cME) sensor. This model
provides a possible framework for calculating transfer functions and simulating
magnetometer behavior in both continuous- and discrete-time simulation
environments, and it is also possibly transferable to other magnetometer types.
Common S-parameters were measured experimentally using an impedance analyzer
and converted to Z-parameters to create a transfer function for system-level
simulations. The model was validated through an analysis of output-related
noise using MATLAB and LTSpice simulations to optimize the noise of the analog
circuit parts of the system. The simulation results were compared with
experimental measurements using a Zurich Instruments lock-in amplifier and the
custom-designed low-noise printed circuit board (PCB) under model
considerations. The proposed methodology derives noise considerations and the
transfer function of a magnetometer. These are essential for readout schemes
for mixed-signal circuit design. This allows low-noise electronics to be
designed and extended to other sensor interface electronics, broadening their
applicability in high-performance magnetic sensing.

Conclusion: 提出的扩展信息论框架能够同时优化压缩效率、失真度和异常检测性能，为压缩监控数据的异常检测系统提供更好的权衡管理方法。

Abstract: Extensive monitoring systems generate data that is usually compressed for
network transmission. This compressed data might then be processed in the cloud
for tasks such as anomaly detection. However, compression can potentially
impair the detector's ability to distinguish between regular and irregular
patterns due to information loss. Here we extend the information-theoretic
framework introduced in [1] to simultaneously address the trade-off between the
three features on which the effectiveness of the system depends: the
effectiveness of compression, the amount of distortion it introduces, and the
distinguishability between compressed normal signals and compressed anomalous
signals. We leverage a Gaussian assumption to draw curves showing how moving on
a Pareto surface helps administer such a trade-off better than simply relying
on optimal rate-distortion compression and hoping that compressed signals can
be distinguished from each other.

Conclusion: 该工作集成了高保真电磁仿真、生成建模和AI驱动优化，为复杂隧道环境中的下一代CBTC系统提供了可扩展且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Urban railway systems increasingly rely on communication based train control
(CBTC) systems, where optimal deployment of access points (APs) in tunnels is
critical for robust wireless coverage. Traditional methods, such as empirical
model-based optimization algorithms, are hindered by excessive measurement
requirements and suboptimal solutions, while machine learning (ML) approaches
often struggle with complex tunnel environments. This paper proposes a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) driven framework that integrates parabolic wave
equation (PWE) channel modeling, conditional generative adversarial network
(cGAN) based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) for
AP placement optimization. The PWE method generates high-fidelity path loss
distributions for a subset of AP positions, which are then expanded by the cGAN
to create high resolution path loss maps for all candidate positions,
significantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical accuracy. In
the DRL framework, the state space captures AP positions and coverage, the
action space defines AP adjustments, and the reward function encourages signal
improvement while penalizing deployment costs. The dueling DQN enhances
convergence speed and exploration exploitation balance, increasing the
likelihood of reaching optimal configurations. Comparative experiments show
that the proposed method outperforms a conventional Hooke Jeeves optimizer and
traditional DQN, delivering AP configurations with higher average received
power, better worst-case coverage, and improved computational efficiency. This
work integrates high-fidelity electromagnetic simulation, generative modeling,
and AI-driven optimization, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for
next-generation CBTC systems in complex tunnel environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG机器学习应用仍然碎片化，局限于狭窄任务或数据集。基础模型承诺更广泛的适应性，但其在不同ECG任务中的泛化能力尚未被充分理解。

Method: 使用12个公共数据集（包含1,650个回归和分类目标）对8个ECG基础模型进行基准测试，在微调和冻结设置下评估，并进行数据集规模的缩放分析。

Result: 在成人ECG解读领域，三个基础模型持续优于强监督基线；在其他类别中，ECG-CPC（基于HEEDB预训练的紧凑结构化状态空间模型）表现最佳，而大多数基础模型未能超越监督学习。基础模型在不同数据集规模下显示出不同的缩放行为。

Conclusion: 基础模型在成人ECG分析中显示潜力，但在心脏结构、结果预测和患者特征化方面仍存在显著差距。ECG-CPC的强劲表现表明ECG基础模型仍有未开发的改进机会。

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a long-standing diagnostic tool. Yet
machine learning for ECG interpretation remains fragmented, often limited to
narrow tasks or datasets. Foundation models promise broader adaptability, but
their generalization across diverse ECG tasks is not well understood. We
benchmarked eight ECG foundation models on 26 clinically relevant tasks using
12 public datasets comprising 1,650 regression and classification targets.
Models were evaluated under fine-tuning and frozen settings, with scaling
analyses across dataset sizes. Results show heterogeneous performance across
domains: in the most widely studied domain, adult ECG interpretation, three
foundation models consistently outperformed strong supervised baselines. In
contrast, ECG-CPC, a compact structured state-space model pretrained on HEEDB,
dominated other categories where most foundation models failed to surpass
supervised learning. Foundation models also displayed distinct scaling
behaviors with dataset size, which are critical for small-scale clinical
applications. Overall, while foundation models show promise for adult ECG
analysis, substantial gaps remain in cardiac structure, outcome prediction, and
patient characterization. Notably, ECG-CPC's strong performance despite being
orders of magnitude smaller and consuming minimal computational resources
highlights untapped opportunities for advancing ECG foundation models.

Motivation: 传统对抗攻击主要关注全局扰动，而局部对抗噪声的潜力尚未充分探索。本研究旨在量化局部对抗攻击在有效性、不可感知性和计算效率方面的表现。

Method: 通过引入二进制掩码将噪声限制在特定区域，在FGSM、PGD和C&W等广泛使用的方法上系统评估局部对抗攻击，比较像素扰动、PSNR、SSIM和攻击成功率等指标。

Result: 局部攻击相比全局攻击实现了显著更低的平均像素扰动、更高的峰值信噪比和结构相似性指数，但计算工作量增加且攻击成功率略有降低。迭代方法比单步方法对局部化约束更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本研究为局部对抗攻击提供了全面分析，为推进攻击策略和设计鲁棒防御系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global
perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized
adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W,
to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational
efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific
regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel
perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these
benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest
reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative
methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than
single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility
metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial
attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and
designing robust defensive systems.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning
(ICL) without parameter updates, making them powerful learning engines for fast
adaptation. While extensive research has examined ICL as a few-shot learner,
whether it can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge
accumulation when multitasks arrive sequentially remains underexplored.
Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics
of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning
(ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and
prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that,
for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice
(DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing "sweet
spot" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention
similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method
aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that
linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like
retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of
Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively
plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm
that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity
dilemma in conventional CL methods.

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world
evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent
neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to
encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical.
However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a
single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of
a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space
GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and
generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not
require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can
discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary
measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve
physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds
a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To
discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional
time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to
encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate
the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry
discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on
par with supervised models designed for single systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构模型架构协同学习中的互操作性和隐私保护挑战

Method: 采用通用融合层输出维度，将模型划分为个性化基础块和通用模块块，客户端共享融合层输出而非模型参数

Result: 相比联邦学习和联邦分割学习基线，实现了更优的通信效率，同时在异构架构下保持稳定训练性能

Conclusion: 该框架为异构模型协同学习提供了通信高效且隐私保护的解决方案

Abstract: Collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures presents
significant challenges in ensuring interoperability and preserving privacy. We
propose a communication-efficient distributed learning framework that supports
model heterogeneity and enables modular composition during inference. To
facilitate interoperability, all clients adopt a common fusion-layer output
dimension, which permits each model to be partitioned into a personalized base
block and a generalized modular block. Clients share their fusion-layer
outputs, keeping model parameters and architectures private. Experimental
results demonstrate that the framework achieves superior communication
efficiency compared to federated learning (FL) and federated split learning
(FSL) baselines, while ensuring stable training performance across
heterogeneous architectures.

### [30] [On the Capacity of Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22840)
*Micah Adler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了自注意力机制的关系图识别框架，推导出容量缩放定律：$D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ 是恢复 $m'$ 个关系所必需且充分的，并基于此为多头注意力提供了新的容量理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解自注意力机制在给定预算下能可靠恢复多少种不同关系的能力，缺乏形式化的容量分析。

Method: 引入关系图识别(RGR)框架，将键-查询通道表示为具有 $m'$ 条有向边的图，通过信息论下界和显式构造推导容量缩放定律，并进行受控单层实验验证。

Result: 推导出容量缩放定律 $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$，实验显示性能阈值与预测容量缩放匹配，证实将 $D_K$ 分配到多个小头能减轻干扰并增加可恢复关系数。

Conclusion: 结果为自注意力容量提供了具体的缩放定律，并为跨头分配键-查询预算提供了原则性设计规则。

Abstract: While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a
formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single
layer reliably recover for a given budget?
  To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the
key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges,
and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We
measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this
framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it
empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both
necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit
construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This
scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head
attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target.
When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a
permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m >
d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating
interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows
that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this
interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled
single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance
threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit
of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.
  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention
capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across
heads.

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication
networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage
limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing
applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and
security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic
environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel
conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links
that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV
swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV
swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an
integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent
energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed
to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between
equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy
expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory
control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions
across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a
novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking
(MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action
spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints
in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by
up to 25% compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier
compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel
black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our
approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary
search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces
under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models,
ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model
(LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates
consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per
instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models
to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL),
where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to
model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL
(MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness
to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to
suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can
promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice,
are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual
representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that
interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value
functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking
evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem
for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic
risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic
algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative
benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves
coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.
Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a
theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in
MARL.

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

Abstract: A major challenge in physics-informed machine learning is to understand how
the incorporation of prior domain knowledge affects learning rates when data
are dependent. Focusing on empirical risk minimization with physics-informed
regularization, we derive complexity-dependent bounds on the excess risk in
probability and in expectation. We prove that, when the physical prior
information is aligned, the learning rate improves from the (slow) Sobolev
minimax rate to the (fast) optimal i.i.d. one without any sample-size deflation
due to data dependence.

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval
and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search
engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption,
the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for
attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to
promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K
recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear
regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies:
CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical
guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to
succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical
results on real-world data.

Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for
maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor
generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we
systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's
ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three
physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii)
complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation.
Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid
configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each
inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and
out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into
which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and
efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 邻域采样在大规模图神经网络训练中至关重要，能抑制邻域大小的指数增长并控制内存和时间成本。虽然已成为标准实现，但其系统性行为尚不明确，需要理论分析。

Method: 使用神经正切核工具分析几种成熟的邻域采样方法及其对应的后验高斯过程，研究有限样本下的训练动态。

Result: 在有限样本下，不同采样方法的GP后验分布各不相同，但随着样本量增加会收敛到相同分布。后验协方差无法比较，这与观察到的没有采样方法占主导地位的现象一致。

Conclusion: 邻域采样方法在有限样本下表现出不同的行为特征，没有单一方法在所有情况下都最优，这为实际应用中的方法选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Neighborhood sampling is an important ingredient in the training of
large-scale graph neural networks. It suppresses the exponential growth of the
neighborhood size across network layers and maintains feasible memory
consumption and time costs. While it becomes a standard implementation in
practice, its systemic behaviors are less understood. We conduct a theoretical
analysis by using the tool of neural tangent kernels, which characterize the
(analogous) training dynamics of neural networks based on their infinitely wide
counterparts -- Gaussian processes (GPs). We study several established
neighborhood sampling approaches and the corresponding posterior GP. With
limited samples, the posteriors are all different, although they converge to
the same one as the sample size increases. Moreover, the posterior covariance,
which lower-bounds the mean squared prediction error, is uncomparable, aligning
with observations that no sampling approach dominates.

Abstract: In the context of industrial factories and energy producers, unplanned
outages are highly costly and difficult to service. However, existing
acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or
synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited
access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly
detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower
plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly
noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then,
we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which
are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage
plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world
conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC
0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered
strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational
cost.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a widely used technique for quantifying
uncertainty in machine learning models. In its standard form, CP offers
probabilistic guarantees on the coverage of the true label, but it is agnostic
to sensitive attributes in the dataset. Several recent works have sought to
incorporate fairness into CP by ensuring conditional coverage guarantees across
different subgroups. One such method is Conformal Fairness (CF). In this work,
we extend the CF framework to the Federated Learning setting and discuss how we
can audit a federated model for fairness by analyzing the fairness-related gaps
for different demographic groups. We empirically validate our framework by
conducting experiments on several datasets spanning multiple domains, fully
leveraging the exchangeability assumption.

Abstract: Manifold alignment (MA) involves a set of techniques for learning shared

of performing out-of-sample extension, limiting their real-world applicability.
We propose a guided representation learning framework leveraging a
geometry-regularized twin autoencoder (AE) architecture to enhance MA while
enabling generalization to unseen data. Our method enforces structured
cross-modal mappings to maintain geometric fidelity in learned embeddings. By
incorporating a pre-trained alignment model and a multitask learning
formulation, we improve cross-domain generalization and representation
robustness while maintaining alignment fidelity. We evaluate our approach using
several MA methods, showing improvements in embedding consistency, information
preservation, and cross-domain transfer. Additionally, we apply our framework
to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, demonstrating its ability to integrate
multi-modal patient data and enhance predictive accuracy in cases limited to a

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to large language model (LLM) distillation by
formulating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. While recent
work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into
distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward
weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes
task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model
to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state
augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a
modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint
satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access
during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian
methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we
demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and
better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while
maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a
theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware
distillation in resource-constrained settings.

Motivation: 解决学习高质量、鲁棒、高效和解耦表示的核心挑战，传统方法主要依赖架构和优化约束，本文引入功能约束作为第三种方法。

Method: 在预训练编码器上附加小型单调多层感知机头，通过对比损失和单调性约束引导编码器与头的协同适应，学习鲁棒、解耦和高度紧凑的嵌入。

Result: 在CIFAR-100图像分类任务中，表示比微调编码器基线紧凑近9倍，鲁棒性提升1.5倍，同时保持99%的5-NN分类准确率；在SNLI句子相似性任务中，表示紧凑3.4倍，鲁棒性提升1.4倍。

Conclusion: 通过功能约束学习的鲁棒、超紧凑表示为从边缘计算到云规模检索等不同场景的关键挑战提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is
a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning
frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization
constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on
$\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple
framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head
attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and
head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns
robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible
performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields
representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the
fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN
classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more
robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal
reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic
framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via
functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in
disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化感知训练(QAT)是提高量化神经网络准确性的主要技术，但FP阶段和QAT阶段之间的计算分配最优策略尚不明确。

Method: 进行大规模实验，研究不同QAT持续时间对最终性能的影响，提出损失缩放定律预测最优QAT比例，并设计冷却与QAT融合方法。

Result: 发现QAT与FP训练的最优比例随总计算量增加而增加，可通过统计量准确预测，融合方法显著节省计算资源。

Conclusion: 这些发现为高效QAT规划提供实用见解，能在相同计算预算下训练更高质量的量化模型。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the
accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing
training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields
superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of
compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive
experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from
86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final
performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the
loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of
compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide
range of model sizes and quantization widths using the
tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss
scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance
across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We
use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify
experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory
constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to
full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and
QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with
quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates
and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical
insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality
quantized models with the same compute budget.

TL;DR: SOAP优化算法在语言建模任务中表现优于Adam和Shampoo，但理论分析表明SOAP与Shampoo在Kronecker乘积假设下是等价的，实验证实两者收敛速度相似，最终损失无显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从梯度白化角度分析Adam、Shampoo和SOAP优化算法，理解它们的预条件器如何近似白化矩阵以捕捉二阶曲率信息。

Method: 建立SOAP和Shampoo在Kronecker乘积假设下的理论等价性，并通过nanoGPT语言建模和灰度图像着色实验进行实证评估。

Result: 实验结果显示SOAP与Shampoo具有相似的收敛速度，在最终损失方面与Adam和Shampoo相比没有显著优势。

Conclusion: SOAP与Shampoo在理论上是等价的，实验验证了这种等价性，表明SOAP在最终性能上并不优于其他两种算法。

Abstract: Shampoo with Adam in the Preconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP) has recently
emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for neural network training,
achieving superior training efficiency over both Adam and Shampoo in language
modeling tasks. In this work, we analyze Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from the
perspective of gradient whitening, interpreting their preconditioners as
approximations to the whitening matrix, which captures second-order curvature
information. We further establish a theoretical equivalence between idealized
versions of SOAP and Shampoo under the Kronecker product assumption. To
empirically evaluate these insights, we reproduce the language modeling
experiments using nanoGPT and grayscale image colorization. Our results show
that SOAP exhibits similar convergence rate as Shampoo, and no significant
advantage over both Adam and Shampoo in the final loss achieved, which aligns
with their equivalence in theory.

TL;DR: SINQ是一种后训练量化方法，通过引入第二轴尺度因子和Sinkhorn-Knopp算法来归一化行列方差，解决低比特量化中的精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前后训练量化方法在4比特及以下精度时会出现困惑度下降，主要因为异常值表示导致共享相同尺度的参数出现精度问题，这在无校准均匀量化方法中尤为明显。

Method: 在现有后训练量化器基础上增加第二轴尺度因子，使用快速Sinkhorn-Knopp算法找到尺度来归一化每行和每列的方差，最小化矩阵不平衡这一新的量化代理目标。

Result: 在Qwen3模型家族和DeepSeek-V2.5上评估，SINQ显著改善了WikiText2和C4的困惑度，相比无校准均匀量化基线有显著提升，且可与校准和非均匀量化级别结合进一步增强。

Conclusion: SINQ方法无需层间交互，可轻松应用于新架构以量化任何线性层，有效解决了低比特量化中的精度问题。

Abstract: Post-training quantization has emerged as the most widely used strategy for
deploying large language models at low precision. Still, current methods show
perplexity degradation at bit-widths less than or equal to 4, partly because
representing outliers causes precision issues in parameters that share the same
scales as these outliers. This problem is especially pronounced for
calibration-free, uniform quantization methods. We introduce SINQ to augment
existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor
and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize
per-row and per-column variances, thereby minimizing a novel per-matrix proxy
target for quantization: the matrix imbalance. Our method has no interactions
between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize
any linear layers. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family and
DeepSeek-V2.5. SINQ improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity significantly against
uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines and can be further enhanced by
combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels. Code to
reproduce the results of this work and to easily quantize models using SINQ is
available at https://github.com/huawei-csl/SINQ.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分数据同化方法在海洋和大气预报中广泛应用，但涉及Hessian信息时计算成本高昂，需要更高效的求解方法。

Method: 使用傅里叶神经算子(FNO)来近似反Hessian算子，为共轭梯度法提供初始化，形成FNO-CG框架。

Result: 在线性平流方程上的实验显示，FNO-CG将平均相对误差降低62%，迭代次数减少17%，在病态条件下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: FNO-CG方法对具有挑战性的数据同化问题展现出鲁棒性和高效性，特别适用于病态场景。

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for enhancing solutions to partial
differential equations (PDEs), such as those in numerical weather prediction,
by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. Variational DA
methods are widely used in oceanic and atmospheric forecasting, but become
computationally expensive, especially when Hessian information is involved. To
address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that employs the
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator
across a family of DA problems, thereby providing an effective initialization
for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear
advection equation demonstrate that the resulting FNO-CG approach reduces the
average relative error by $62\%$ and the number of iterations by $17\%$
compared to the standard CG. These improvements are most pronounced in
ill-conditioned scenarios, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG
for challenging DA problems.

Motivation: 现有的深度生成模型在估计潜在结果分布时缺乏Neyman正交性这一理论优势特性，无法实现双重鲁棒性和准oracle效率。

Method: 开发了基于条件归一化流、条件生成对抗网络、条件变分自编码器和条件扩散模型的GDR-learners，这些方法具有Neyman正交性和双重鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GDR-learners提供了具有理论保证的灵活框架，能够实现准oracle效率和双重鲁棒性，是因果推断中潜在结果分布估计的有效工具。

Abstract: Various deep generative models have been proposed to estimate potential
outcomes distributions from observational data. However, none of them have the
favorable theoretical property of general Neyman-orthogonality and, associated
with it, quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness. In this paper, we
introduce a general suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal (doubly-robust)
learners that estimate the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. Our
proposed GDR-learners are flexible and can be instantiated with many
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In particular, we develop GDR-learners
based on (a) conditional normalizing flows (which we call GDR-CNFs), (b)
conditional generative adversarial networks (GDR-CGANs), (c) conditional
variational autoencoders (GDR-CVAEs), and (d) conditional diffusion models
(GDR-CDMs). Unlike the existing methods, our GDR-learners possess the
properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and rate double robustness, and are thus
asymptotically optimal. In a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we
demonstrate that our GDR-learners are very effective and outperform the
existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential
outcomes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI) systems see growing adoption, a key concern involves
the external validity of evaluations, or the extent to which they generalize
from lab-based to real-world deployment conditions. Threats to the external
validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and
system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target
distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust
estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to
our approach is the use of "persona" ratings produced by prompting an LLM
evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific
sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these
informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under
evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality
estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality
estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using
persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a
reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We
validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation
Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the
degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data. Our work provides a
principled foundation for combining imperfect persona ratings with human
ratings observed under sampling bias to obtain valid system quality estimates.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to scale to large, combinatorial action
spaces common in many real-world problems. This paper introduces a novel
framework for training discrete diffusion models as highly effective policies
in these complex settings. Our key innovation is an efficient online training
process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By leveraging
policy mirror descent (PMD) to define an ideal, regularized target policy
distribution, we frame the policy update as a distributional matching problem,
training the expressive diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This
decoupled approach stabilizes learning and significantly enhances training
performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample
efficiency across a diverse set of challenging combinatorial benchmarks,
including DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent
systems. Experiments demonstrate that our diffusion policies attain superior
performance compared to other baselines.

Motivation: 离策略强化学习中的actor-critic方法面临两个主要挑战：评论家学习受到"致命三角"不稳定性和"移动目标"问题的影响，而演员学习因难以准确估计离策略策略梯度而效率低下。

Method: 引入了函数评论家建模的新概念，提出了一个新的AC框架，在线性函数设置下进行了理论分析，并设计了专门的神经网络架构用于函数评论家建模。

Result: 理论分析证明了该框架的可收敛性，据作者所知这是第一个可收敛的离策略目标型AC算法。在DeepMind Control Benchmark上的初步实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的函数评论家建模方法成功解决了离策略actor-critic学习中的关键挑战，为在致命三角设置下的AC学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an
effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within
this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical
success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the
off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad"
instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target"
problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor
learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact
off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem
to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the
second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and
often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is
typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy
gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of
functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses
both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We
provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the
provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical
perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network
architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its
effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the
DeepMind Control Benchmark.

Abstract: We introduce FAEclust, a novel functional autoencoder framework for cluster
analysis of multi-dimensional functional data, data that are random
realizations of vector-valued random functions. Our framework features a
universal-approximator encoder that captures complex nonlinear
interdependencies among component functions, and a universal-approximator
decoder capable of accurately reconstructing both Euclidean and manifold-valued
functional data. Stability and robustness are enhanced through innovative
regularization strategies applied to functional weights and biases.
Additionally, we incorporate a clustering loss into the network's training
objective, promoting the learning of latent representations that are conducive
to effective clustering. A key innovation is our shape-informed clustering
objective, ensuring that the clustering results are resistant to phase
variations in the functions. We establish the universal approximation property
of our non-linear decoder and validate the effectiveness of our model through
extensive experiments.

Abstract: Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and
decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental
across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations
research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex
reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural
language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however,
achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without
leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate
optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear
programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans
training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common
mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference
strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver
feedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs
demonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and
feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average,
enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.

Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a
framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D)
communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs,
PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states
to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which
normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device
battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study
two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves
the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms
inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios
grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic
and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative
low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context,
reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for
always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As machine learning models continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient
serving faces increasingly broad trade-offs spanning accuracy, latency,
resource usage, and other objectives. Multi-model serving further complicates
these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision
balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the
pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain
largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees
and general applicability.
  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a
multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to
exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the
ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for
achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that
strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to
the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the
optimal trade-off in polynomial time.
  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and
early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that
recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy-latency
trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging
heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and
cascaded models.

Abstract: Existing on-device AI architectures for resource-constrained environments
face two critical limitations: they lack compactness, with parameter
requirements scaling proportionally to task complexity, and they exhibit poor
generalizability, performing effectively only on specific application domains
(e.g., models designed for regression tasks cannot adapt to natural language
processing (NLP) applications). In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture
inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and
lightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple
domains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches:
(1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task
complexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression,
classification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern
recognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely
low model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains.
For compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer
parameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated
consistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision
dataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to
90%). Lastly, it delivers superior forecasting accuracy for complex patterns,
achieving 1.6 times lower mean absolute error and 2.1 times lower mean squared
error than competing models.

TL;DR: 将变分方法引入稀疏自编码器(SAE)并不能改善特征组织和可解释性，反而因KL散度正则化导致性能下降和更多死亡特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究变分方法是否能改善稀疏自编码器的特征组织和可解释性，假设概率采样能创造分散压力使特征在潜在空间中更连贯地组织。

Method: 提出变分稀疏自编码器(vSAE)，用从学习的高斯后验中随机采样替换确定性ReLU门控，并加入向标准正态先验的KL散度正则化。

Result: vSAE在核心评估指标上表现不如标准SAE，虽然特征独立性和消融指标更优，但KL散度项导致过度正则化，显著减少活跃特征比例，性能下降且死亡特征更多。

Conclusion: 将变分方法简单应用于SAE并不能改善特征组织或可解释性，需要更精细的方法来平衡正则化压力。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for
interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse,
human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether
incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature
organization and interpretability. We introduce the variational Sparse
Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic
sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence
regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this
probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to
organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We
evaluate a Topk vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer
residual steam activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench,
individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space
visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core
evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics.
The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that
substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed
performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness,
they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that
naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature
organization or interpretability.

*Konstantina Bairaktari,Huy L. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多类预测器校准误差定义，在指数样本复杂度和多项式样本复杂度的两种现有校准误差概念之间进行插值，并给出了多项式样本复杂度的校准算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多类预测器的校准面临挑战，因为可能的预测值呈指数级增长。现有校准误差概念要么需要指数级样本，要么需要多项式样本但只能校准给定预测器，需要在这两者之间找到平衡。

Method: 提出新的校准误差定义，在两种现有校准误差概念之间插值。使用自适应数据分析技术，虽然适应性高但样本复杂度只有对数开销。

Result: 算法能够在除一个端点外的整个插值范围内校准任何给定预测器，且仅需多项式数量的样本。在另一个端点处，对误差参数的依赖接近最优，优于先前工作。

Conclusion: 该工作通过新的校准误差定义和自适应数据分析技术，在多类预测器校准的样本复杂度方面取得了重要进展，在指数和多项式样本复杂度之间找到了平衡点。

Abstract: Calibrating a multiclass predictor, that outputs a distribution over labels,
is particularly challenging due to the exponential number of possible
prediction values. In this work, we propose a new definition of calibration
error that interpolates between two established calibration error notions, one
with known exponential sample complexity and one with polynomial sample
complexity for calibrating a given predictor. Our algorithm can calibrate any
given predictor for the entire range of interpolation, except for one endpoint,
using only a polynomial number of samples. At the other endpoint, we achieve
nearly optimal dependence on the error parameter, improving upon previous work.
A key technical contribution is a novel application of adaptive data analysis
with high adaptivity but only logarithmic overhead in the sample complexity.

TL;DR: MoE-PHDS是一种轻量级的SFT方法，可将单个MoE检查点转换为全局稀疏度控制表面，实现推理时动态调整稀疏度而无需更换模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏MoE模型需要在固定稀疏度下训练，为满足不同效率目标需训练多个模型，增加了服务复杂性和成本。

Method: 通过跨稀疏度混合训练和高稀疏度短课程学习，无需架构修改，将单个检查点转换为可控制稀疏度的模型。

Result: 在多个模型上实验表明，PHDS匹配或超过专用模型，跨稀疏度一致性提升达22%，实现灵活的运行时MoE部署。

Conclusion: MoE-PHDS使全局稀疏度成为一级服务原语，简化了MoE模型的部署灵活性。

Abstract: Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed
sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity
level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently,
meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple
models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance
costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and
energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime
sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\bf P}ost {\bf
H}oc {\bf D}eclared {\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a
single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training
across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity,
requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency
tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time
without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level
heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary
models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds
well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\%
vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE
deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.

Motivation: 扩散模型训练将数据分布映射到最优评分函数，研究能否微分这个映射，从而在重新训练前预测模型对训练集微小扰动的响应。

Method: 开发了闭式程序计算该映射的方向导数，仅需预训练评分模型及其对输入的导数的黑盒访问。扩展到估计扩散模型样本对目标测度加性扰动的敏感性。

Result: 方法对数值和近似误差具有鲁棒性，计算时间与从扩散模型采样和计算样本路径的对数似然相当。敏感性结果与重新训练和微调后图像扩散模型样本的变化相关。

Conclusion: 实现了无需重新训练即可预测扩散模型对训练数据扰动的响应，为模型敏感性分析提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Training a diffusion model approximates a map from a data distribution $\rho$
to the optimal score function $s_t$ for that distribution. Can we differentiate
this map? If we could, then we could predict how the score, and ultimately the
model's samples, would change under small perturbations to the training set
before committing to costly retraining. We give a closed-form procedure for
computing this map's directional derivatives, relying only on black-box access
to a pre-trained score model and its derivatives with respect to its inputs. We
extend this result to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples
to additive perturbations of its target measure, with runtime comparable to
sampling from a diffusion model and computing log-likelihoods along the sample
path. Our method is robust to numerical and approximation error, and the
resulting sensitivities correlate with changes in an image diffusion model's
samples after retraining and fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有的高阶消息传递方法基于Hodge拉普拉斯算子，但其在高维情况下的归纳偏置不够明确甚至可能退化。层理论提供了一种更原则性的方法来修改Hodge拉普拉斯算子的扩散机制。

Method: 开发了基于层拉普拉斯算子的新理论和方法，将图学习中的层扩散理论扩展到高阶设置（k>0），层拉普拉斯算子的归纳偏置将k维数据特征与k维层上同调相关联。

Result: 提出了一个自包含的层理论介绍，从抽象到应用层面，并开发了适用于高阶设置的新理论和实践方法。

Conclusion: 层理论为拓扑深度学习中的高阶消息传递提供了一个自然且原则性的形式化框架，能够实现更富有表达力的消息传递机制。

Abstract: Recent work in Topological Deep Learning (TDL) seeks to generalize graph
learning's preeminent $message \ passing$ paradigm to more complex relational
structures: simplicial complexes, cell complexes, hypergraphs, and combinations
thereof. Many approaches to such ${higher\text{-}order \ message \ passing}$
(HOMP) admit formulation in terms of nonlinear diffusion with the Hodge
(combinatorial) Laplacian, a graded operator which carries an inductive bias
that dimension-$k$ data features correlate with dimension-$k$ topological
features encoded in the (singular) cohomology of the underlying domain. For
$k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In
higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and
potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a
natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's
diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more
expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates
dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware
generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend
prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light --
and explore how it fails to generalize to $k>0$ -- before developing novel
theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied
by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the
applied.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的密集联想记忆模型仅限于向量表示，无法处理概率分布。本文旨在将联想记忆从向量扩展到完整分布，连接经典DAMs与现代生成建模。

Method: 定义了存储分布上的log-sum-exp能量函数和基于Gibbs加权聚合最优传输映射的检索动态。平稳点对应自洽的Wasserstein重心。

Result: 证明了指数存储容量，在Wasserstein扰动下提供了定量检索保证，并在合成和真实世界分布任务上验证了模型有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作将联想记忆从向量提升到完整分布，在记忆增强学习中实现了分布的存储和检索。

Abstract: Dense associative memories (DAMs) store and retrieve patterns via
energy-functional fixed points, but existing models are limited to vector
representations. We extend DAMs to probability distributions equipped with the
2-Wasserstein distance, focusing mainly on the Bures-Wasserstein class of
Gaussian densities. Our framework defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored
distributions and a retrieval dynamics aggregating optimal transport maps in a
Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent
Wasserstein barycenters, generalizing classical DAM fixed points. We prove
exponential storage capacity, provide quantitative retrieval guarantees under
Wasserstein perturbations, and validate the model on synthetic and real-world
distributional tasks. This work elevates associative memory from vectors to
full distributions, bridging classical DAMs with modern generative modeling and
enabling distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning.

TL;DR: 论文通过谱分析方法研究大语言模型训练过程中的几何相变，发现自回归预训练存在三个几何阶段：初始的表示坍缩、熵寻求阶段和压缩寻求阶段，后训练方法会进一步改变表示几何。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准训练指标如损失无法解释大语言模型中复杂能力的涌现，需要从表示几何的角度来理解模型训练过程。

Method: 使用谱分析方法，测量有效秩(RankMe)和特征谱衰减($\alpha$-ReQ)，在OLMo(1B-7B)和Pythia(160M-12B)模型上分析预训练和后训练过程中的表示几何变化。

Result: 发现自回归预训练存在三个一致的几何相变：初始表示坍缩、熵寻求阶段(维度扩展)和压缩寻求阶段(各向异性压缩)，后训练方法SFT/DPO驱动熵寻求而RLVR驱动压缩寻求。

Conclusion: 模型训练中的几何相变源于交叉熵优化与词频偏斜、表示瓶颈的相互作用，后训练方法通过不同的几何动态来整合特定数据或对齐奖励。

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

Motivation: 在高维数据集中在低维流形的假设下，解决当流形仅通过数据分布隐式给出且缺乏标准流形操作时的优化问题，这对现代生成AI至关重要。

Method: 引入连接函数将数据分布与几何操作联系起来，建立与扩散模型中得分函数的联系，提出DLF和DRGD两种推理算法。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成和设计应用提供了实用解决方案，能够利用预训练得分网络进行优化。

Abstract: Under the data manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional data are concentrated
near a low-dimensional manifold. We study the problem of Riemannian
optimization over such manifolds when they are given only implicitly through
the data distribution, and the standard manifold operations required by
classical algorithms are unavailable. This formulation captures a broad class
of data-driven design problems that are central to modern generative AI. Our
key idea is to introduce a link function that connects the data distribution to
the geometric operations needed for optimization. We show that this function
enables the recovery of essential manifold operations, such as retraction and
Riemannian gradient computation. Moreover, we establish a direct connection
between our construction and the score function in diffusion models of the data
distribution. This connection allows us to leverage well-studied
parameterizations, efficient training procedures, and even pretrained score
networks from the diffusion model literature to perform optimization. Building
on this foundation, we propose two efficient inference-time algorithms --
Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD)
-- and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate
manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm). Finally,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on finite-horizon reference
tracking tasks in data-driven control, highlighting its potential for practical
generative and design applications.

Motivation: 灾难性干扰（灾难性遗忘）是机器学习中的基本挑战，模型在学习新任务时会逐渐失去对先前任务的性能。本文旨在从潜在表示学习角度更好地理解和建模这一问题。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略：首先使用最大似然估计从PTA和ATA配置中学习潜在表示，然后优化KL散度来识别和学习共享潜在变量。

Result: 理论保证和实证验证表明，识别和学习这些共享表示可以有效减轻机器学习系统中的灾难性干扰。

Conclusion: 通过识别PTA和ATA设置间的共享潜在变量，可以最小化遗忘现象，为缓解灾难性干扰提供了理论保证和实际性能改进。

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a
fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model
progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to
new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic
interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and
propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference
as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting
phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA)
and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in
identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through
identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning,
we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we
employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from
both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to
identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee
and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these
shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in
machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and
practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark
datasets.

Motivation: 影响函数需要计算大而病态的Hessian矩阵逆，现有近似方法如GGN和K-FAC使计算可行，但近似对数据归因性能的影响尚不清楚，且理论上更好的Hessian近似是否必然带来更好的归因性能存在疑问。

Method: 在受控分类设置下研究Hessian近似质量对影响函数归因的影响，分解近期Hessian近似方法的各步骤并评估每个步骤对归因准确性的影响。

Result: 实验表明更好的Hessian近似持续产生更好的影响分数质量；K-FAC特征值与GGN/EK-FAC特征值的不匹配是主要误差和影响损失来源。

Conclusion: 研究结果为改进Hessian近似的努力提供了依据，并指出了哪些近似步骤最关键，指导未来在计算可行性和归因准确性之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Influence functions offer a principled way to trace model predictions back to
training data, but their use in deep learning is hampered by the need to invert
a large, ill-conditioned Hessian matrix. Approximations such as Generalised
Gauss-Newton (GGN) and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) have
been proposed to make influence computation tractable, yet it remains unclear
how the departure from exactness impacts data attribution performance.
Critically, given the restricted regime in which influence functions are
derived, it is not necessarily clear better Hessian approximations should even
lead to better data attribution performance. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a
controlled classification setting. Our experiments show that better Hessian
approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, offering
justification for recent research efforts towards that end. We further
decompose the approximation steps for recent Hessian approximation methods and
evaluate each step's influence on attribution accuracy. Notably, the mismatch
between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues accounts for the majority
of the error and influence loss. These findings highlight which approximations
are most critical, guiding future efforts to balance computational tractability
and attribution accuracy.

Motivation: 6G网络需要边缘智能，联邦学习是关键范式，但面临数据敏感性和异构性挑战：参数共享存在重构风险，统一全局模型难以适应本地分布。

Method: 使用样本级表示进行知识共享，应用个性化DP策略抵抗重构攻击；开发隐私感知的神经架构搜索算法，生成本地定制化架构和超参数。

Abstract: The Sixth-Generation (6G) network envisions pervasive artificial intelligence
(AI) as a core goal, enabled by edge intelligence through on-device data
utilization. To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a
key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the
sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter
sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to
adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel
federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy
(DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage
sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP
strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware
adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural
architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized
architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with
theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy
guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
methods in model performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our scheme improves accuracy by 6.82\%
over the federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS, while reducing model size to 1/10
and communication cost to 1/20.

Abstract: Data selection is designed to accelerate learning with preserved performance.
To achieve this, a fundamental thought is to identify informative data samples
with significant contributions to the training. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Evolved Sampling} (\textbf{ES}), a simple yet effective framework for
\emph{dynamic} sampling along the training process. This method conducts \em
batch \em level data selection based on the dynamics of losses and augmented
\emph{loss differences}, which enables flexible \emph{frequency tuning}, and
hence significantly reduces the back propagation time with maintained model
performance. Due to its conciseness, ES is also readily extensible to
incorporate \em set \em level data selection (to form ES with pruning,
\textbf{ESWP}) for further accelerations. As a plug-and-play framework, ES(WP)
consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various
pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45\% wall-clock time.
Our results motivate further investigations on the data efficiency aspect of
modern large-scale machine learning.

TL;DR: GuardNet是一个分层过滤框架，通过构建结构化图结合图神经网络来检测和过滤越狱提示，在多个数据集上显著优于现有防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越容易受到越狱攻击，这些攻击会绕过对齐约束并引发未经授权或有害行为，威胁LLM在医疗、金融和法律等关键领域的安全性、可靠性和可信度。

Method: GuardNet构建结合序列链接、句法依赖和注意力派生令牌关系的结构化图，捕捉越狱行为的语言结构和上下文模式。应用两层图神经网络：提示级过滤器检测全局对抗提示，令牌级过滤器定位细粒度对抗跨度。

Result: 在三个数据集和多种攻击设置下，GuardNet显著优于现有防御。提示级F1分数在LLM-Fuzzer上从66.4%提升至99.8%，在PLeak数据集上从67-79%提升至超过94%。令牌级F1从48-75%提升至74-91%，IoU增益高达+28%。

Conclusion: 尽管结构复杂，GuardNet保持了可接受的延迟并在跨域评估中泛化良好，使其成为现实世界LLM部署中对抗越狱威胁的实用且鲁棒的防御方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak
attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and
induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the
safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks
in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we
propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters
jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs
that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived
token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns
indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two
levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and
(ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans.
Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show
that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level
F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\%
on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to
74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity,
GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain
evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats
in real-world LLM deployments.

Motivation: 研究群不变神经网络的理论基础，探索编码对称结构是否能带来统计优势，为实际应用提供理论指导。

Method: 在Barron框架下分析群不变神经网络的泛化误差，考察近似误差和估计误差，通过Rademacher复杂度比较不变与非不变类。

Result: 群不变结构引入δ≤1因子改善近似精度，Rademacher复杂度不增加，因此泛化误差在对称函数学习中得到显著提升。

Conclusion: 编码群不变结构为对称目标函数提供了明确的统计优势，理论分析支持在实际应用中利用对称性提升神经网络性能。

Abstract: We investigate the generalization error of group-invariant neural networks
within the Barron framework. Our analysis shows that incorporating
group-invariant structures introduces a group-dependent factor
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma} \le 1$ into the approximation rate. When this factor
is small, group invariance yields substantial improvements in approximation
accuracy. On the estimation side, we establish that the Rademacher complexity
of the group-invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant
counterpart, implying that the estimation error remains unaffected by the
incorporation of symmetry. Consequently, the generalization error can improve
significantly when learning functions with inherent group symmetries. We
further provide illustrative examples demonstrating both favorable cases, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx |G|^{-1}$, and unfavorable ones, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx 1$. Overall, our results offer a rigorous
theoretical foundation showing that encoding group-invariant structures in
neural networks leads to clear statistical advantages for symmetric target

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IsingFormer是一个基于Transformer的神经网络，通过生成全局自旋配置来加速马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法，在采样和组合优化任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的MCMC方法在临界点和复杂景观中混合缓慢，并行回火虽然通过温度交换改善混合，但每个副本仍依赖缓慢的局部更新。需要能够生成全局配置的方法来加速采样和优化。

Method: 训练Transformer在平衡样本上学习生成整个自旋配置，这些无相关样本作为Metropolis步骤中的全局移动提议，与传统的单自旋翻转互补使用。

Result: 在2D Ising模型采样中，成功复现磁化和自由能曲线，并能泛化到未见温度；在3D自旋玻璃优化中，找到能量更低的状态；在整数分解问题中，训练于有限半素数后能成功泛化到未见半素数。

Conclusion: IsingFormer证明通过神经提议捕获全局结构可以系统性地加速蒙特卡洛方法，实现更快的采样和更强的组合优化性能，并能泛化到整个问题家族。

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and
combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough
landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across
temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its
configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium
samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the
target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for
global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual
single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces
magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures,
including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces
equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses
(optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy
states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes.
Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems,
IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to
unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution.
Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize
across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move
beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer
demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by
neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and
stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了CRIB框架，直接从不完整时间序列进行预测，避免传统插值-预测方法中插值误差对预测准确性的负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统插值-预测方法存在根本问题：缺失值没有真实标签，插值过程容易引入错误并破坏数据分布，从而降低预测准确性。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈原理，结合统一变量注意力机制和一致性正则化方案，学习能够过滤缺失值噪声同时保留关键预测信号的鲁棒表示。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，CRIB在高缺失率下仍能准确预测，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: CRIB框架通过直接从不完整数据预测，避免了插值误差，为多变量时间序列预测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time
series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of
research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing
data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework
that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting
on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there
is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process
susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct
supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade
prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves
away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time
series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a
novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a
unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to
learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values
while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts
accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in
https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.

*Zijian Wang,Xiaofei Zhang,Xin Zhang,Yukun Liu,Qiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习范式，其中中央服务器不仅聚合模型更新，还主动指导新任务分配到最合适的客户端，利用统计异质性作为特征而非缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等隐私敏感领域，不同客户端（如医院）的数据分布存在显著差异。现有FL算法主要关注聚合异构客户端的模型更新，但中央服务器的潜力未被充分探索。本文受医疗场景启发：中央服务器能否不仅构建模型，还能指导新患者到最适合其特定病情的医院？

Method: 引入基于经验似然的框架，同时解决两个目标：(1)在每个客户端上学习有效的本地模型，(2)为新查询找到最佳匹配的客户端。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实证结果表明，该框架在模型准确性和客户端指导精度方面均优于标准FL方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更智能、资源效率更高的联邦系统开辟了新方向，将异质性作为特征而非缺陷加以利用。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare,
where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is
statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly
across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient
demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates
from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains
under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a
central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the
hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to
propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the
allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the
network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework
that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on
each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query.
Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark
datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of
client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new
direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated
systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug. Code is

TL;DR: 提出连续时间确定性策略梯度方法CT-DDPG，解决离散时间算法在连续环境中的稳定性问题，实现更稳定快速的学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界RL应用多为连续复杂环境，但现有离散时间算法对时间离散化敏感，导致稳定性差和收敛慢的问题

Method: 基于优势函数推导连续时间策略梯度公式，建立其鞅特征，提出CT-DDPG算法

Result: 数值实验表明CT-DDPG在多种控制任务中比现有离散和连续时间方法具有更好的稳定性和更快的收敛速度

Conclusion: CT-DDPG为连续时间环境中的确定性策略学习提供了稳定高效的解决方案

Abstract: The theory of discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced rapidly
over the past decades. Although primarily designed for discrete environments,
many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major
challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is
their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and
slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient
methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient
formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its
martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed
algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies
in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to
existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of
control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过分析大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)的嵌入链，揭示了语言先验现象，并提出了视觉整合点(VIP)和总视觉整合度(TVI)估计器来量化视觉信息对模型行为的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在完成多模态任务时，往往过度依赖预训练中学到的语言先验，而未能充分利用视觉证据。现有分析方法无法揭示视觉信息如何影响模型内部机制。

Method: 通过分析LVLMs层间表示动态，识别视觉整合点(VIP)，并引入总视觉整合度(TVI)估计器来量化视觉查询对响应生成的影响程度。

Result: 在54个模型-数据集组合(涵盖9个当代LVLMs和6个基准测试)中，VIP现象普遍存在，且TVI能可靠预测语言先验的强度。

Conclusion: 该方法为诊断和理解LVLMs中的语言先验提供了一个原则性工具包，有助于揭示视觉信息何时以及如何影响模型行为。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal
tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual
patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior
analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the
internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To
address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior
through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise
representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal
phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical
layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden
representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we
introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates
representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query
influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9
contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently
emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This
offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in
LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测真实银行流中的支付欺诈需要能够利用事件顺序和不规则时间间隔的模型。

Method: 在标准GPT架构基础上增加专用时间编码器（嵌入绝对时间戳或事件间时间值）和学习的位置编码器（保持相对顺序）。

Result: 在包含数千万交易和辅助事件的工业数据集上，FraudTransformer超越了四个强基线（逻辑回归、XGBoost、LightGBM）以及省略时间或位置组件的Transformer变体，在测试集上获得最高AUROC和PRAUC。

Conclusion: FraudTransformer通过有效整合时间信息和位置信息，在支付欺诈检测任务中表现出色，证明了时间感知序列模型的价值。

Abstract: Detecting payment fraud in real-world banking streams requires models that
can exploit both the order of events and the irregular time gaps between them.
We introduce FraudTransformer, a sequence model that augments a vanilla
GPT-style architecture with (i) a dedicated time encoder that embeds either
absolute timestamps or inter-event values, and (ii) a learned positional
encoder that preserves relative order. Experiments on a large industrial
dataset -- tens of millions of transactions and auxiliary events -- show that
FraudTransformer surpasses four strong classical baselines (Logistic
Regression, XGBoost and LightGBM) as well as transformer ablations that omit
either the time or positional component. On the held-out test set it delivers
the highest AUROC and PRAUC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习率调度器要么遵循简单的参数函数，要么仅对短期训练信号做出反应，缺乏对神经网络训练过程的全面时间视图支持。

Method: 将神经网络训练性能建模为动态系统，利用超参数搜索的训练运行学习训练过程的潜在表示，根据当前训练指标预测最佳长期验证性能的学习率计划。

Result: 在CNN、ResNet图像分类和Transformer下一词预测任务上达到SOTA结果，训练出的模型位于损失景观更平坦区域，提供更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效、优化器无关，可轻松集成到ML实验跟踪平台上，为学习率调度提供了更智能的解决方案。

Abstract: The learning rate schedule is one of the most impactful aspects of neural
network optimization, yet most schedules either follow simple parametric
functions or react only to short-term training signals. None of them are
supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually
train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training
performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training
runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the
training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future
learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our
scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates
specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions.
It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as
well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models
are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better
generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is
computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top
of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be
made available after acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出贝叶斯MoE路由框架，通过建模路由决策的概率分布来替代确定性专家选择，显著提升路由稳定性、校准性能和OoD检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准MoE架构的确定性路由机制存在脆弱性，导致模型校准不足和过度自信，系统无法识别自身知识的局限性。

Method: 在权重空间、对数空间和选择空间三个不同阶段引入原则性不确定性，构建贝叶斯MoE路由框架。

Result: 在30亿参数MoE模型上的实验表明，该框架显著改善了路由稳定性、分布内校准和分布外检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过针对核心架构组件引入不确定性，可以构建更可靠的内在不确定性信号，为创建更稳健和自知的LLMs提供实用路径。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has enabled the creation of massive
yet efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the standard deterministic
routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness
is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in
systems that often do not know what they don't know.
  This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured
\textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single,
deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution
over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families
of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of
the routing pipeline: in the \textbf{weight-space}, the \textbf{logit-space},
and the final \textbf{selection-space}.
  Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE
model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing
stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD)
detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural
component, we can create a more reliable internal uncertainty signal. This work
provides a practical and computationally tractable pathway towards building
more robust and self-aware LLMs, taking a crucial step towards making them know
what they don't know.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前AI时间序列预测评估中的根本缺陷——标准评估指标混淆了模型性能与数据内在不可预测性，需要更公平、更深入的评价方法。

Method: 引入谱相干性可预测性(SCP)评分和线性利用比率(LUR)诊断工具，SCP量化预测实例的内在难度，LUR测量模型利用线性可预测信息的效率。

Result: 验证了框架有效性，首次系统证明了"可预测性漂移"现象，并揭示了关键架构权衡：复杂模型在低可预测性数据上表现更好，而线性模型在更可预测任务上更有效。

Conclusion: 倡导范式转变，从简单的聚合评分转向更深入的可预测性感知评估，促进更公平的模型比较和对模型行为的更深刻理解。

Abstract: In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting,
progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards.
However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation
metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic
unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel,
predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our
framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence
Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and
task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given
forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a
frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a
model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We
validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core
insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability
drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over
time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex
models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are
highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift,
moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful,
predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a
deeper understanding of model behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-Gating方法，一种完全可微的结构化过参数化技术，通过将权重组分解为主要权重向量和多个标量门控因子来实现结构化稀疏性，理论上等价于解决原始组稀疏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏正则化能够紧凑神经网络，但其不可微性破坏了与传统随机梯度下降的兼容性，需要专门的优化器或额外的后处理剪枝，且缺乏形式化保证。

Method: D-Gating方法将每个权重组分解为主要权重向量和多个标量门控因子，通过这种完全可微的结构化过参数化实现结构化稀疏性。

Result: 证明D-Gating的任何局部最小值也是非光滑结构化L_{2,2/D}惩罚的局部最小值，且D-Gating目标在梯度流极限下至少以指数速度收敛到L_{2,2/D}正则化损失。在视觉、语言和表格任务中验证了该方法始终提供强大的性能-稀疏性权衡。

Conclusion: D-Gating在理论上等价于解决原始组稀疏问题，但诱导了从非稀疏机制演变为稀疏优化的独特学习动态，在多个任务中优于直接优化结构化惩罚和传统剪枝基线。

Abstract: Structured sparsity regularization offers a principled way to compact neural
networks, but its non-differentiability breaks compatibility with conventional
stochastic gradient descent and requires either specialized optimizers or
additional post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees. In this work, we propose
$D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits
each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating
factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local
minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show
that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the
$L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results
show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group
sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a
non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across
vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers
strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization
of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.

TL;DR: CLAD-Net是一个持续学习框架，通过结合自监督Transformer和知识蒸馏CNN，解决可穿戴传感器数据中的分布偏移和灾难性遗忘问题，在PAMAP2数据集上达到91.36%准确率，仅8.78%遗忘率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中可穿戴传感器数据存在分布偏移问题（如不同受试者数据差异），传统深度学习模型假设数据分布稳定，在持续学习场景下会出现灾难性遗忘，且人类研究中的标注数据稀缺且不一致。

Method: CLAD-Net整合自监督Transformer（作为长期记忆）和监督CNN（通过知识蒸馏训练）。Transformer通过跨传感器注意力捕获全局活动模式，学习无需标签的可泛化表示；CNN通过知识蒸馏在逐受试者微调时保留先验知识。

Result: 在PAMAP2数据集上，CLAD-Net达到91.36%最终准确率，仅8.78%遗忘率，优于基于记忆和正则化的基线方法。在半监督设置下（仅10-20%标注数据）仍表现良好，消融研究验证了各模块贡献。

Conclusion: CLAD-Net能够在不牺牲过去任务性能的情况下持续更新可穿戴传感器模型，对标注数据稀缺具有鲁棒性，为现实世界持续学习场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of deep learning has greatly advanced human behavior monitoring
using wearable sensors, particularly human activity recognition (HAR). While
deep models have been widely studied, most assume stationary data distributions
- an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, sensor
data from one subject may differ significantly from another, leading to
distribution shifts. In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence
of tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from
catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are
learned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of
labeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net
(Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling
wearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing
performance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer,
acting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The
transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across
body-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels.
Meanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge
during subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent
final accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and
regularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight
Consolidation. In semi-supervised settings with only 10-20 percent labeled
data, CLAD-Net still delivers strong performance, demonstrating robustness to
label scarcity. Ablation studies further validate each module's contribution.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对奇Sigmoid激活函数类的初始化方法，通过闭式选择噪声尺度来避免激活值塌陷或饱和，无需归一化层即可可靠训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活函数和权重初始化相互依赖，不合适的初始化会导致饱和、方差塌陷和学习率敏感性增加，需要为特定激活函数设计专门的初始化方法。

Method: 定义了奇Sigmoid函数类，并为该类中的任何激活函数f提出初始化方法，通过闭式选择噪声尺度确保前向激活在目标层之前保持良好分散。

Result: 该方法无需归一化层即可可靠训练，表现出强大的数据效率，能够在标准初始化方法（Xavier、He、Orthogonal）通常无法可靠收敛的激活函数下实现学习。

Conclusion: 提出的初始化方法解决了激活函数与权重初始化的相互依赖问题，为特定激活函数类别提供了有效的初始化解决方案。

Abstract: Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and
recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However,
activations and weight initialization are interdependent: without an
appropriate initialization method, nonlinearities can cause saturation,
variance collapse, and increased learning rate sensitivity. We address this by
defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this
class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a
noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up
to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation.
Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers,
exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under
which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not
converge reliably.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统CoT方法中高层战略规划与低层逐步执行耦合的问题，这些问题导致计算效率低、推理路径探索有限和可解释性差。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方法：监督微调（SFT）结合强化学习（RL），并引入严格遵循计划的数据生成算法。推理时采用探索-执行分离架构。

Result: 在AIME'2024上达到58.1%准确率，仅使用<10%的解码token；在医疗基准上比标准SFT准确率提升14.5%，仅使用3.5%的token。

Conclusion: E²C框架通过解耦规划和执行，实现了高效推理、强泛化能力和更好的可解释性，为LLM推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient
test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches
58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods
(e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For
cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with
only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher
accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art
performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating
planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are

Conclusion: DFC通过提供分布式的贝尔曼目标，显著提升了流策略的性能，为复杂多模态行为的建模提供了更有效的学习信号。

Abstract: Flow-based policies have recently emerged as a powerful tool in offline and
offline-to-online reinforcement learning, capable of modeling the complex,
multimodal behaviors found in pre-collected datasets. However, the full
potential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics,
which typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a
novel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return
distribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow
matching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible
transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target
distribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based
policy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable
and informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance,
especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in
both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.

*Chenruo Liu,Yijun Dong,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了弱到强泛化中的关键问题：当使用弱教师生成的伪标签在存在虚假相关性的下游任务上微调强预训练学生模型时，弱到强泛化是否会发生以及如何改进失败情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在存在群体不平衡导致的虚假相关性情况下，弱到强泛化的表现机制和改进方法，特别是当标记数据和非标记数据的群体分布不一致时。

Method: 理论分析在比例渐近极限下的弱到强增益，并通过大量实验验证理论结果。提出一种简单有效的算法补救措施：在弱到强微调后，在强学生模型的高置信度数据子集上重新训练。

Result: 理论表明当η_u = η_ℓ时弱到强泛化总能发生，但当η_u ≠ η_ℓ时可能失败，弱到强增益随(η_u - η_ℓ)^2增加而减少。提出的算法在多种虚假相关性基准和师生模型对上取得一致且显著的改进。

Conclusion: 弱到强泛化在群体分布匹配时可靠，但在分布不匹配时可能失败。提出的无群体标签算法能有效提升弱到强泛化性能，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We initiate a unified theoretical and algorithmic study of a key problem in
weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization: when fine-tuning a strong pre-trained
student with pseudolabels from a weaker teacher on a downstream task with
spurious correlations, does W2S happen, and how to improve it upon failures? We
consider two sources of spurious correlations caused by group imbalance: (i) a
weak teacher fine-tuned on group-imbalanced labeled data with a minority group
of fraction $\eta_\ell$, and (ii) a group-imbalanced unlabeled set
pseudolabeled by the teacher with a minority group of fraction $\eta_u$.
Theoretically, a precise characterization of W2S gain at the proportional
asymptotic limit shows that W2S always happens with sufficient pseudolabels
when $\eta_u = \eta_\ell$ but may fail when $\eta_u \ne \eta_\ell$, where W2S
gain diminishes as $(\eta_u - \eta_\ell)^2$ increases. Our theory is
corroborated by extensive experiments on various spurious correlation
benchmarks and teacher-student pairs. To boost W2S performance upon failures,
we further propose a simple, effective algorithmic remedy that retrains the
strong student on its high-confidence data subset after W2S fine-tuning. Our
algorithm is group-label-free and achieves consistent, substantial improvements
over vanilla W2S fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了网络基础模型(NFMs)中的潜在知识，通过三部分评估揭示现有模型存在显著各向异性、不一致特征敏感性、无法分离高层上下文等问题，并证明解决这些问题可显著提升模型性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注下游任务性能，而缺乏对网络基础模型内部潜在知识的系统性分析。本文旨在通过分析隐藏表示来深入理解这些模型编码的知识特性。

Method: 采用三部分评估方法：嵌入几何分析评估表示空间利用，度量对齐评估测量与领域专家特征的对应关系，因果敏感性测试评估对协议扰动的鲁棒性。使用五个不同网络数据集评估四个最先进的NFMs。

Result: 所有模型都表现出显著各向异性、不一致的特征敏感性模式、无法分离高层上下文、负载依赖性等特性。通过解决这些限制，模型性能可显著提升(最高提升0.35 F1分数，无需架构改变)。

Conclusion: 网络基础模型存在系统性限制，通过分析并解决这些限制可以显著改进模型性能，为未来网络基础模型的开发提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge
encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden
representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance.
Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part
evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space
utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with
domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness
to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning
controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs,
revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature
sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload
dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations
across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly
improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural
changes).

Method: 对CAVs构建过程进行细粒度的理论分析，量化其变异性，并在多个真实数据集上进行实验验证。

Conclusion: 基于方差随1/N减小的规律，提出了资源高效应用CAV方法的实用建议，有助于在保证解释质量的同时优化计算资源的使用。

Abstract: One of the most pressing challenges in artificial intelligence is to make
models more transparent to their users. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence has come up with numerous method to tackle this challenge. A
promising avenue is to use concept-based explanations, that is, high-level
concepts instead of plain feature importance score. Among this class of
methods, Concept Activation vectors (CAVs), Kim et al. (2018) stands out as one
of the main protagonists. One interesting aspect of CAVs is that their
computation requires sampling random examples in the train set. Therefore, the
actual vectors obtained may vary from user to user depending on the randomness
of this sampling. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained theoretical analysis
of CAVs construction in order to quantify their variability. Our results,
confirmed by experiments on several real-life datasets, point out towards an
universal result: the variance of CAVs decreases as $1/N$, where $N$ is the
number of random examples. Based on this we give practical recommendations for
a resource-efficient application of the method.

TL;DR: 结合混合密度网络与对比学习成本，提出四种核化矩阵成本用于数据密度近似


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于距离的成对成本在自监督和对比特征学习中很重要，混合密度网络广泛用于生成模型和密度近似，但需要学习多个中心来定义混合密度

Method: 将混合密度网络与对比成本结合，使用四种核化矩阵成本：标量成本、向量-矩阵成本、矩阵-矩阵成本（Schur补迹）和SVD成本（核范数）

Result: 提出了学习混合密度所需多个中心的新方法

Conclusion: 通过结合MDNs与对比成本，成功开发了数据密度近似的新框架

Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive
feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach
for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to
produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with
contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four
types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the
matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the
nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture
density.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在强化学习训练中经常通过捷径策略获得表面正确的答案，其推理过程可能是不忠实或虚假的，且在小因果扰动下性能会下降。

Method: 使用基于雅可比矩阵的敏感性估计模型内部影响，通过反事实强化抑制干扰线索，并将因果连贯性分数与任务准确性反馈通过Minkowski组合器融合，形成统一奖励函数。

Result: 在4个数据集上的实验表明，CE-PO平均比基线提高5.49%的准确率（最高9.58%），同时提高了对相关-因果翻转和轻量反事实编辑的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CE-PO能够有效减少奖励黑客行为和不忠实推理链，在保持准确率的同时显著提高模型对因果扰动的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often
achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct
outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal
perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a
drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a
differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from
prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal
influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these
signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with
task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single
tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates
with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and
causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful
chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and
light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results
across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on
average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation
flips and light counterfactual edits.

Conclusion: 该方法在无需人口统计信息的情况下实现了偏好公平性，为高风险领域提供了可行的公平机器学习解决方案

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in social domains
to make predictions about humans, there is a growing concern that these
algorithms may exhibit biases against certain social groups. Numerous notions
of fairness have been proposed in the literature to measure the unfairness of
ML. Among them, one class that receives the most attention is
\textit{parity-based}, i.e., achieving fairness by equalizing treatment or
outcomes for different social groups. However, achieving parity-based fairness
often comes at the cost of lowering model accuracy and is undesirable for many
high-stakes domains like healthcare. To avoid inferior accuracy, a line of
research focuses on \textit{preference-based} fairness, under which any group
of individuals would experience the highest accuracy and collectively prefer
the ML outcomes assigned to them if they were given the choice between various
sets of outcomes. However, these works assume individual demographic
information is known and fully accessible during training. In this paper, we
relax this requirement and propose a novel \textit{demographic-agnostic
fairness without harm (DAFH)} optimization algorithm, which jointly learns a
group classifier that partitions the population into multiple groups and a set
of decoupled classifiers associated with these groups. Theoretically, we
conduct sample complexity analysis and show that our method can outperform the
baselines when demographic information is known and used to train decoupled
classifiers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed
method.

Abstract: Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure,
decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates
opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in
anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in
blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and
temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and
adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that
integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection.
Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves
high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate
below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular
architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future
integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph
neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term
adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight
ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time
cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway
toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

Motivation: 偏微分方程控制的逆问题在科学和工程中至关重要，但由于不适定性、数据稀疏性和不规则几何形状的复杂性而具有挑战性。传统方法计算成本高，而现有学习方法大多针对规则域或前向建模。

Method: GeoFunFlow结合了新颖的几何函数自编码器(GeoFAE)和通过整流流训练的潜在扩散模型。GeoFAE使用Perceiver模块处理不同大小的非结构化网格，生成物理场的连续重建。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，GeoFunFlow在复杂几何形状上实现了最先进的重建精度，提供了校准的不确定性量化，并且相比算子学习和扩散模型基线具有更高的推理效率。

Conclusion: GeoFunFlow为复杂几何形状上的逆问题提供了一个高效且准确的解决方案，结合了几何感知编码和扩散建模的优势。

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are
crucial in science and engineering. They are particularly challenging due to
ill-posedness, data sparsity, and the added complexity of irregular geometries.
Classical PDE-constrained optimization methods are computationally expensive,
especially when repeated posterior sampling is required. Learning-based
approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yet most are designed for
regular domains or focus on forward modeling. Here, we introduce {\em
GeoFunFlow}, a geometric diffusion model framework for inverse problems on
complex geometries. GeoFunFlow combines a novel geometric function autoencoder
(GeoFAE) and a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow. GeoFAE
employs a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and
produces continuous reconstructions of physical fields, while the diffusion
model enables posterior sampling from sparse and noisy data. Across five
benchmarks, GeoFunFlow achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy over
complex geometries, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and
delivers efficient inference compared to operator-learning and diffusion model
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了8位Muon优化器，使用分块量化技术，在保持性能的同时显著减少内存占用，在LLM预训练中优于AdamW和8位AdamW。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在LLM预训练中表现出比AdamW更快的收敛速度和计算效率，但它与AdamW一样是有状态的，需要存储模型权重和累积梯度。现有的8位AdamW变体通过分块量化缓解了这种开销，但通常只在动态量化下稳定。

Method: 引入8位Muon优化器，使用分块量化技术，支持线性和动态两种量化方案。

Result: 8位Muon在两种量化方案下都保持稳定，相比全精度Muon减少约74%的内存占用。在1.6B模型预训练和Llama 3.2 3B模型微调实验中，8位Muon性能接近Muon，优于AdamW和8位AdamW。

Conclusion: 8位Muon优化器在显著减少内存占用的同时保持了性能，为大规模模型训练提供了高效的解决方案，并通过理论分析解释了其在量化下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer, based on matrix orthogonalization, has recently shown
faster convergence and up to 2x computational efficiency over AdamW in LLM
pretraining. Like AdamW, Muon is stateful, requiring storage of both model
weights and accumulated gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants mitigate this
overhead using blockwise quantization, they are typically stable only under
dynamic quantization - which improves stability on linear quantization for
extreme values. In this paper, we introduce the 8-bit Muon optimizer using
blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic schemes. We
demonstrate that 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both, while delivering
$\sim$74\% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision Muon. In
extensive experiments, 8-bit Muon closely matches the performance of Muon while
outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pre-training a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb
tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B
model on post-training data. We also provide a theoretical perspective to help
explain this robustness under quantization.

Method: 使用为信号处理中点源分离问题开发的局部三角多项式核技术，将不同类别视为来自不同概率分布，通过分层MASC算法处理重叠/接触的类别边界。

Result: 在多个模拟和真实数据集（包括Salinas和Indian Pines高光谱数据集以及文档数据集）上验证了理论有效性。

Conclusion: 局部核技术能够有效分离不同概率分布的支撑集，MASC分层算法可处理复杂类别边界，为分类问题提供了理论保证的新方法。

Abstract: The problem of classification in machine learning has often been approached
in terms of function approximation. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach for classification in arbitrary compact metric spaces which, in
theory, yields both the number of classes, and a perfect classification using a
minimal number of queried labels. Our approach uses localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels initially developed for the point source signal separation
problem in signal processing. Rather than point sources, we argue that the
various classes come from different probability distributions. The localized
kernel technique developed for separating point sources is then shown to
separate the supports of these distributions. This is done in a hierarchical
manner in our MASC algorithm to accommodate touching/overlapping class
boundaries. We illustrate our theory on several simulated and real life
datasets, including the Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets and a
document dataset.

Motivation: 人类移动预测面临复杂的长程依赖和多尺度周期性行为挑战，需要有效处理这些时空模式。

Conclusion: RHYTHM框架成功地将LLM应用于人类移动预测，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法往往会扭曲细节或引入意外伪影，需要一种能够保持源图像视觉相似性同时实现语义编辑的方法。

Method: 使用耦合SDEs，通过驱动源图像和编辑图像使用相同的相关噪声，引导新样本朝向期望语义同时保持与源图像的视觉相似性。

Result: 该方法无需重新训练或辅助网络即可工作，实现了高提示保真度和接近像素级的图像一致性。

Conclusion: 耦合SDEs是受控生成AI的一个简单而强大的工具。

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains
challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce
unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential
equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained
generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and
rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image
with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the
desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method
works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high
prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position
coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

TL;DR: 提出Impute-MACFM，一种基于掩码感知条件流匹配的表格数据插补框架，专门处理随机缺失、随机缺失和非随机缺失机制，在多种基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据在医疗等应用中很常见，但缺失值问题严重影响了模型的准确性和可靠性。现有插补方法要么假设过于严格，要么难以处理复杂的跨特征结构，而生成方法存在不稳定和推理成本高的问题。

Method: 使用掩码感知目标函数，仅在缺失条目上构建轨迹，同时约束观测条目的预测速度接近零；结合稳定性惩罚、一致性正则化和时间衰减噪声注入；推理时使用约束保持的ODE积分和每步投影来固定观测值。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Impute-MACFM实现了最先进的性能，比竞争方法提供更鲁棒、高效和高质量的插补结果。

Conclusion: 流匹配为表格缺失数据问题（包括纵向数据）提供了一个有前景的方向，Impute-MACFM展示了其在处理复杂缺失机制方面的优势。

Abstract: Tabular data are central to many applications, especially longitudinal data
in healthcare, where missing values are common, undermining model fidelity and
reliability. Prior imputation methods either impose restrictive assumptions or
struggle with complex cross-feature structure, while recent generative
approaches suffer from instability and costly inference. We propose
Impute-MACFM, a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular
imputation that addresses missingness mechanisms, missing completely at random,
missing at random, and missing not at random. Its mask-aware objective builds
trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to
remain near zero on observed entries, using flexible nonlinear schedules.
Impute-MACFM combines: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii)
consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed
noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving
ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix
observed values, optionally aggregating multiple trajectories for robustness.
Across diverse benchmarks, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art results while
delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing
approaches, establishing flow matching as a promising direction for tabular
missing-data problems, including longitudinal data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正交梯度更新方法计算成本高（O(n^3)），且动量应用受限；现有方法如Muon虽降低到O(n^2)但仍不够高效。

Method: 结合双曲余弦RMS缩放变换和归一化，在谱范数信任区域内约束动量更新，无需显式构建半正交矩阵。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，AuON及其混合变体性能与AdamW和Muon等强基线相当。

Conclusion: AuON提供了一种计算高效的替代方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in
optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as
SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and
underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is
applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon,
improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing
semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to
O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck.
  In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based
updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm
trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit
semi-orthogonalization.
  We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized
nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance
without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural
alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines
hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating
both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz
methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a
single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language
benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable
to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at

TL;DR: KREPES是一个通过Nyström近似实现可扩展核表示学习的统一框架，解决了传统核方法在大规模无标签数据上表示学习时的可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核方法虽然理论基础坚实，但在可扩展性方面长期受到时间和内存成本的限制。在基础模型时代，需要从海量无标签数据中学习表示，但缺乏可扩展的核表示学习框架。

Method: 使用Nyström近似构建统一的核表示学习框架KREPES，支持多种无监督和自监督损失函数。

Conclusion: KREPES填补了核方法在可扩展表示学习方面的空白，为核方法在基础模型时代的应用提供了可行方案，并具有优于深度模型的可解释性优势。

Abstract: Kernel methods provide a theoretically grounded framework for non-linear and
non-parametric learning, with strong analytic foundations and statistical
guarantees. Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time
and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no
framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting
their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned
from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable
framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation.
KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses,
and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency.
Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned
representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate
through dedicated analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逆强化学习方法中，对抗式方法训练不稳定，非对抗式方法缺乏理论保证，需要一种既稳定又有理论保证的IRL方法

Method: 提出TRRO框架，通过Minorization-Maximization过程保证单调改进，并实例化为PIRO算法，结合能量函数和信任区域优化

Result: 在MuJoCo、Gym-Robotics基准测试和真实动物行为建模任务中，PIRO在奖励恢复和策略模仿方面达到或超过最先进基线，且具有高样本效率

Conclusion: TRRO为IRL提供了类似TRPO在正向RL中的稳定性保证，PIRO算法实现了稳定且理论保证的逆强化学习

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain
expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax)
formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often
lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve
stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations
but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a
unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly
maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing
the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust
Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic
improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We
instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical
and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to
the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward
RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward
recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and
Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

TL;DR: 本文比较了决策曲线分析(DCA)和成本曲线在模型评估中的关系，发现决策曲线与Brier曲线密切相关，两者在相同阈值下会选择相同的最优模型，但Brier曲线适用性更广且面积等于Brier分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型评估应充分考虑使用场景和决策阈值，需要比较DCA和成本曲线这两种评估方法的关系、优势和局限性。

Method: 通过理论分析和比较决策曲线与Brier曲线的关系，探讨了两种方法在模型校准假设下的数学等价性。

Result: 决策曲线与Brier曲线在x轴等价，在任何给定阈值下都会选择相同的最优模型。Brier曲线适用性更广，其面积等于Brier分数。

Conclusion: Brier曲线比DCA更具普适性，建议在DCA中使用上包络决策曲线来显示仅通过重新校准可能实现的净收益增益。

Abstract: Classification models typically predict a score and use a decision threshold
to produce a classification. Appropriate model evaluation should carefully
consider the context in which a model will be used, including the relative
value of correct classifications of positive versus negative examples, which
affects the threshold that should be used. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and
cost curves are model evaluation approaches that assess the expected utility
and expected loss of prediction models, respectively, across decision
thresholds. We compared DCA and cost curves to determine how they are related,
and their strengths and limitations. We demonstrate that decision curves are
closely related to a specific type of cost curve called a Brier curve. Both
curves are derived assuming model scores are calibrated and setting the
classification threshold using the relative value of correct positive and
negative classifications, and the x-axis of both curves are equivalent. Net
benefit (used for DCA) and Brier loss (used for Brier curves) will always
choose the same model as optimal at any given threshold. Across thresholds,
differences in Brier loss are comparable whereas differences in net benefit
cannot be compared. Brier curves are more generally applicable (when a wider
range of thresholds are plausible), and the area under the Brier curve is the
Brier score. We demonstrate that reference lines common in each space can be
included in either and suggest the upper envelope decision curve as a useful
comparison for DCA showing the possible gain in net benefit that could be
achieved through recalibration alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前INR配置缺乏系统性策略，依赖临时启发式方法、暴力网格搜索或任务特定调优，导致跨模态结果不一致。需要建立原则性方法来优化激活函数选择、初始化尺度、层间适应等配置参数。

Method: 使用贝叶斯优化在离散激活函数族（如SIREN、WIRE、FINER）和连续初始化参数的联合空间中高效探索，通过数据驱动的优化过程寻找最优配置。

Result: OptiINR能够提供全局最优配置，在各种信号处理应用中持续最大化性能，为INR设计建立了原则性基础。

Conclusion: OptiINR框架通过系统化优化方法解决了INR配置的挑战，取代了碎片化的手动调优，实现了跨模态的一致高性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative
paradigm in signal processing and computer vision, excelling in tasks from
image reconstruction to 3D shape modeling. Yet their effectiveness is
fundamentally limited by the absence of principled strategies for optimal
configuration - spanning activation selection, initialization scales,
layer-wise adaptation, and their intricate interdependencies. These choices
dictate performance, stability, and generalization, but current practice relies
on ad-hoc heuristics, brute-force grid searches, or task-specific tuning, often
leading to inconsistent results across modalities. This work introduces
OptiINR, the first unified framework that formulates INR configuration as a
rigorous optimization problem. Leveraging Bayesian optimization, OptiINR
efficiently explores the joint space of discrete activation families - such as
sinusoidal (SIREN), wavelet-based (WIRE), and variable-periodic (FINER) - and
their associated continuous initialization parameters. This systematic approach
replaces fragmented manual tuning with a coherent, data-driven optimization
process. By delivering globally optimal configurations, OptiINR establishes a
principled foundation for INR design, consistently maximizing performance
across diverse signal processing applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出用catnat函数替代softmax函数来处理深度学习中的离散分类变量，从信息几何角度证明catnat能产生对角Fisher信息矩阵，从而提升梯度下降效率，在多种任务中取得更好的测试性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中的离散分类变量广泛存在，但其离散性给梯度下降学习带来挑战。现有研究主要改进梯度估计技术，本文从信息几何角度发现softmax函数的局限性，寻求更好的替代方案。

Method: 1) 从信息几何角度分析softmax的局限性；2) 提出catnat函数，通过一系列层次二分法构建，能产生对角Fisher信息矩阵；3) 在图像结构学习、变分自编码器和强化学习等任务中进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，catnat函数能提高学习效率，在多种任务中产生持续更高的测试性能。该函数易于实现，与现有代码库兼容，且与标准训练稳定技术保持兼容。

Conclusion: catnat函数是softmax函数的更好替代方案，能有效解决离散分类变量在深度学习中的梯度下降挑战，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning
architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning
environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express
relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their
discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning
algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient
estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1)
revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its
limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the
$\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of
a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers
significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher
Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure
learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically
show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields
models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$
is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases.
Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques
and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE)机制，将注意力中的键值对重新构想为局部专家，通过局部过滤无关时间戳实现自适应专家选择，同时保留全局专家捕获长期依赖关系，显著提升时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Transformer在时间序列建模中的两个关键问题：(1) 固有的滞后效应，历史时间戳对查询的相关性动态变化；(2) 异常段引入噪声信号降低预测准确性。

Method: 提出TMOE机制，将键值对视为局部专家，对每个查询进行自适应专家选择，同时保留全局专家。在PatchTST和Timer框架中替换原始注意力机制，得到TimeExpert和TimeExpert-G版本。

Result: 在7个真实世界长期预测基准测试中，TimeExpert和TimeExpert-G优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TMOE机制有效解决了时间序列建模中的滞后效应和异常段问题，在不增加结构修改的情况下显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures dominate time series modeling by enabling
global attention over all timestamps, yet their rigid 'one-size-fits-all'
context aggregation fails to address two critical challenges in real-world
data: (1) inherent lag effects, where the relevance of historical timestamps to
a query varies dynamically; (2) anomalous segments, which introduce noisy
signals that degrade forecasting accuracy. To resolve these problems, we
propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism
that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a
distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each
query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this
local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength
in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention
mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and
Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific
version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on
seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert
and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

Motivation: 当前时间序列预测模型评估缺乏高质量基准测试，存在预训练数据污染、因果和描述泄漏等问题，导致进展的假象。

Method: 制定了高保真基准测试的核心原则（数据来源完整性、严格因果合理性、结构清晰性），基于这些原则从实时API构建了Fidel-TS大规模基准测试。

Result: 实验验证了该方法，揭示了先前基准测试的关键偏差和设计限制，并证明文本信息的因果相关性是多模态预测获得真正性能提升的关键因素。

Conclusion: 构建高质量基准测试需要遵循数据来源完整性、因果合理性和结构清晰性原则，文本信息的因果相关性对多模态时间序列预测至关重要。

Abstract: The evaluation of time series forecasting models is hindered by a critical
lack of high-quality benchmarks, leading to a potential illusion of progress.
Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data
contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage
prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core
principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity,
strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new
large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing
data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by
exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks.
Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual
information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in
multimodal forecasting.

Conclusion: Mirror-Critique框架通过提供信息性批判信号，有效提升了LLM的推理性能和诚实性，超越了传统多数投票方法。

Abstract: Test-time scaling via solution sampling and aggregation has become a key
paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While reward model selection is commonly employed in this approach, it
often fails to identify minority-yet-correct answers, which limits its
effectiveness beyond that of simple majority voting. We argue that this
limitation stems from a lack of informative critique signals during verifier
training. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mirror-Critique, a framework that
trains a verifier with informative critiques. Our key insight is to leverage
the rich critique signal by contrasting model-generated solutions with
ground-truth solutions. We deploy a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize
high-quality critique data with rejection sampling that teaches the verifier
not only what is wrong, but also why. The synthetic data is used to cold-start
the LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability. The
resulting Mirror-Verifier is deployed to evaluate candidate solutions by
generating multiple critiques per solution, aggregating them into a verify
score used for weighted voting or selective abstention. The experimental
results show that our Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting
in terms of solution accuracy and also improves the solver's honesty to
recognize and abstain from answering beyond its capability boundaries.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws underlie many of the recent advances in deep learning,
yet their theoretical understanding remains largely confined to linear models.
In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic
and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging
connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed
phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of
sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between
distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely
reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish
a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained
network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide
a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the
emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization
performance, yielding an interpretation from first principles.

Conclusion: CrystalGym为强化学习研究者和材料科学家提供了一个测试平台，处理耗时奖励信号的新挑战类别，为未来跨学科研究铺平道路。

Abstract: In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on
high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine
learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of
generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve
training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the
adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL
environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark
common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing
various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for
challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are
directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms
we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and
ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to
optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we
include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with
reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for
CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and
material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical
applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for
reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals,
paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning
motivated by real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CATE估计方法(元学习器)在低重叠区域表现不佳，需要一种能够专门处理低重叠问题的改进方法。

Method: 引入重叠自适应正则化(OAR)，使正则化强度与重叠权重成比例，在低重叠区域施加更强的正则化。该方法适用于参数和非参数二阶模型，并提出了保持Neyman正交性的去偏版本。

Result: 通过(半)合成实验证明，与恒定正则化相比，OAR在低重叠设置下显著改善了CATE估计性能。

Conclusion: OAR是首个在元学习器正则化项中利用重叠权重的方法，能有效提升CATE估计在低重叠区域的准确性。

Abstract: The conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is widely used in
personalized medicine to inform therapeutic decisions. However,
state-of-the-art methods for CATE estimation (so-called meta-learners) often
perform poorly in the presence of low overlap. In this work, we introduce a new
approach to tackle this issue and improve the performance of existing
meta-learners in the low-overlap regions. Specifically, we introduce
Overlap-Adaptive Regularization (OAR) that regularizes target models
proportionally to overlap weights so that, informally, the regularization is
higher in regions with low overlap. To the best of our knowledge, our OAR is
the first approach to leverage overlap weights in the regularization terms of
the meta-learners. Our OAR approach is flexible and works with any existing
CATE meta-learner: we demonstrate how OAR can be applied to both parametric and
non-parametric second-stage models. Furthermore, we propose debiased versions
of our OAR that preserve the Neyman-orthogonality of existing meta-learners and
thus ensure more robust inference. Through a series of (semi-)synthetic
experiments, we demonstrate that our OAR significantly improves CATE estimation
in low-overlap settings in comparison to constant regularization.

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical for timely diagnosis and
intervention, yet infrequent clinical assessments often lack the sensitivity
and temporal resolution to capture subtle cognitive declines in older adults.
Passive smartphone sensing has emerged as a promising approach for naturalistic
and continuous cognitive monitoring. Building on this potential, we implemented
a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from
sequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data
collected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions
are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1)
routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing
each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic
personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from
individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on
6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area
Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and
demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of
scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive
sensing.

Motivation: 研究Transformer模型在推理时token随网络深度演化的动力学特性，通过物理类比来理解模型内部表示的形成过程。

Method: 将token建模为平均场相互作用粒子系统，在中等相互作用机制下（token数量N大，逆温度参数β与N共同缩放）分析系统的多尺度动力学。

Conclusion: 为Transformer模型的token演化动力学提供了严格的数学描述，揭示了其多尺度演化特性，并通过仿真验证了理论结果。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of tokens through the depth of
encoder-only transformer models at inference time by modeling them as a system
of particles interacting in a mean-field way and studying the corresponding
dynamics. More specifically, we consider this problem in the moderate
interaction regime, where the number $N$ of tokens is large and the inverse
temperature parameter $\beta$ of the model scales together with $N$. In this
regime, the dynamics of the system displays a multiscale behavior: a fast
phase, where the token empirical measure collapses on a low-dimensional space,
an intermediate phase, where the measure further collapses into clusters, and a

TL;DR: ProtoTS是一个可解释的时间序列预测框架，通过建模原型时间模式实现高精度和透明决策，提供层次化原型解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释模型只能提供局部和部分解释，无法揭示异质输入变量如何共同塑造预测曲线中的整体时间模式。

Method: 基于去噪表示计算实例-原型相似度，通过层次化原型捕获全局时间模式和局部细粒度变化，支持专家引导和多层次可解释性。

Result: 在多个现实基准测试中，ProtoTS不仅预测精度超过现有方法，还能提供专家可引导的解释以支持模型理解和决策。

Conclusion: ProtoTS成功实现了高精度预测与透明决策的结合，通过原型建模为时间序列预测提供了更深入的可解释性。

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series
forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making
process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable
models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the
capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly
shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS,
a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy
and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal
patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised
representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The
prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns
with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with
detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability.
Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF
dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast
accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model
understanding and decision support.

*Daniil Dmitriev,Harald Eskelund Franck,Carolin Heinzler,Amartya Sanyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个学习理论框架来研究机器学习系统在自标注数据上训练时可能出现的回声室效应，引入了扩展阈值维度作为该模型下可学习性的精确度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统越来越多地在自标注数据上训练，它们可能强化错误并成为自身信念的回声室。本文旨在建模这种现象，分析在这种回放设置下的学习能力。

Method: 提出了在线学习回放设置框架，引入扩展阈值维度(ExThD)作为可学习性的度量，并设计了基于闭包的算法来应对回放对手。

Result: 证明了扩展阈值维度是该模型下可学习性的精确度量，基于闭包的学习者最多犯ExThD(H)个错误，且没有算法能做得更好。对于闭包类，在随机对手下也有类似界限。

Conclusion: 回放设置比经典错误界限设置更难学习，某些类具有常数Littlestone维度但任意大的ExThD。恰当学习表现出更尖锐的分离：类在回放下可恰当学习当且仅当它（几乎）是闭包类。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly train on self-annotated data, they
risk reinforcing errors and becoming echo chambers of their own beliefs. We
model this phenomenon by introducing a learning-theoretic framework: Online
Learning in the Replay Setting. In round $t$, the learner outputs a hypothesis
$\hat{h}_t$; the adversary then reveals either the true label $f^\ast(x_t)$ or
a replayed label $\hat{h}_i(x_t)$ from an earlier round $i < t$. A mistake is
counted only when the true label is shown, yet classical algorithms such as the
SOA or the halving algorithm are easily misled by the replayed errors.
  We introduce the Extended Threshold dimension, $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$,
and prove matching upper and lower bounds that make
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ the exact measure of learnability in this model.
A closure-based learner makes at most $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ mistakes
against any adaptive adversary, and no algorithm can perform better. For
stochastic adversaries, we prove a similar bound for every intersection-closed
class. The replay setting is provably harder than the classical mistake bound
setting: some classes have constant Littlestone dimension but arbitrarily large
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$. Proper learning exhibits an even sharper
separation: a class is properly learnable under replay if and only if it is
(almost) intersection-closed. Otherwise, every proper learner suffers
$\Omega(T)$ errors, whereas our improper algorithm still achieves the
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ bound. These results give the first tight
analysis of learning against replay adversaries, based on new results for
closure-type algorithms.

TL;DR: 本文从理论上分析了注意力机制如何学习选择性地关注信息丰富的token，从而检测弱、罕见且稀疏分布的特征。研究表明注意力分类器在信号强度仅需对数增长时就能实现渐近零测试误差，优于需要线性增长的线性分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究注意力机制何时以及如何能够学习选择性地关注信息丰富的token，从而实现对弱、罕见且稀疏分布特征的检测。

Method: 在稀疏token分类模型中，正样本在随机选择的token子集中嵌入弱信号向量，负样本为纯噪声。在长序列极限下分析单层注意力分类器的表现，并在高维机制下研究有限序列长度的训练过程。

Result: 证明注意力分类器在信号强度仅需对数增长时就能实现渐近零测试误差，而线性分类器需要线性增长。仅需两次梯度更新就能使注意力分类器的查询权重向量与隐藏信号对齐，产生选择性放大信息token的注意力图。

Conclusion: 注意力机制通过自适应token选择在检测弱、稀疏特征方面具有显著优势，其容量远大于非自适应线性基线方法。

Abstract: When and how can an attention mechanism learn to selectively attend to
informative tokens, thereby enabling detection of weak, rare, and sparsely
located features? We address these questions theoretically in a sparse-token
classification model in which positive samples embed a weak signal vector in a
randomly chosen subset of tokens, whereas negative samples are pure noise. In
the long-sequence limit, we show that a simple single-layer attention
classifier can in principle achieve vanishing test error when the signal
strength grows only logarithmically in the sequence length $L$, whereas linear
classifiers require $\sqrt{L}$ scaling. Moving from representational power to
learnability, we study training at finite $L$ in a high-dimensional regime,
where sample size and embedding dimension grow proportionally. We prove that
just two gradient updates suffice for the query weight vector of the attention
classifier to acquire a nontrivial alignment with the hidden signal, inducing
an attention map that selectively amplifies informative tokens. We further
derive an exact asymptotic expression for the test error and training loss of
the trained attention-based classifier, and quantify its capacity -- the
largest dataset size that is typically perfectly separable -- thereby
explaining the advantage of adaptive token selection over nonadaptive linear
baselines.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究参数高效微调（PEFT）在科学机器学习中的应用，发现Adapter调优优于LoRA，并提出基于频谱复杂度的F-Adapter，在3D Navier-Stokes基准测试中取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数高效微调在视觉和语言处理中已被证明有效，但在科学机器学习中尚未探索，该领域需要建模复杂物理系统。

Method: 1. 系统比较LoRA和Adapter在大型算子模型中的性能；2. 理论分析LoRA在傅里叶层中的近似误差；3. 提出频率自适应适配器（F-Adapter），根据频谱复杂度分配适配器容量。

Result: F-Adapter在多个挑战性3D Navier-Stokes基准测试中取得最先进结果，显著提高了泛化能力和频谱保真度，优于LoRA和其他PEFT技术。

Conclusion: 这是首个探索科学机器学习中PEFT的工作，确立了F-Adapter作为该领域有效范式，为复杂物理系统建模提供了高效微调方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of powerful pre-trained models for
complex downstream tasks has proven effective in vision and language
processing, yet this paradigm remains unexplored in scientific machine
learning, where the objective is to model complex physical systems. We conduct
the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs)
obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that
the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance
on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that
stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within
Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and,
by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain
exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain.
Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical
characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce
Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity
based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to
low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency
components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on
multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both
generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques
commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to
explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an
effective paradigm for this domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLASS Flows提出了一种新的采样范式，通过在流匹配模型内部模拟另一个流匹配模型来采样马尔可夫转移，结合了ODE的效率和SDE的随机演化特性，无需重新训练即可提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励对齐算法在推理时依赖SDE采样，效率低下且性能较差，而ODE采样虽然高效但缺乏随机性。需要一种方法结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出GLASS Flows采样范式，从预训练模型中提取'内部'流匹配模型来模拟马尔可夫转移，结合Feynman-Kac Steering进行推理时优化。

Result: 在大规模文生图模型中，GLASS Flows消除了随机演化与效率之间的权衡，实现了最先进的文本到图像生成性能。

Conclusion: GLASS Flows为流和扩散模型提供了一种简单、即插即用的推理时扩展解决方案，显著提升了生成质量和效率。

Abstract: The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved
at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a
major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a
common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many
algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is
significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To
remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that
simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov
transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be
retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the
efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale
text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between
stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS
Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making
it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZeroSiam是一种用于测试时熵最小化的非对称孪生架构，通过非对称散度对齐防止模型崩溃，在保持高效的同时提升模型在视觉适应和大语言模型推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的测试时熵最小化方法容易导致模型崩溃，比如通过放大logit范数或将所有预测推向主导类别来简单最小化熵，而缺乏有意义的泛化学习。

Method: 提出ZeroSiam非对称孪生架构，使用可学习的预测器和分类器前的停止梯度操作器来实现非对称散度对齐，有效防止崩溃。

Result: 实验证明ZeroSiam不仅能防止崩溃，还能吸收和正则化有偏学习信号，在多种测试场景和模型（包括易崩溃的小模型）中表现稳定且高效。

Conclusion: ZeroSiam通过简单的非对称设计解决了测试时熵最小化的崩溃问题，在视觉适应和语言模型推理任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Test-time entropy minimization helps adapt a model to novel environments and
incentivize its reasoning capability, unleashing the model's potential during
inference by allowing it to evolve and improve in real-time using its own
predictions, achieving promising performance. However, pure entropy
minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit
norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking
collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize
the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce
ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time
entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence
alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a
stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but
also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance
even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show
that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible
overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language
model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models,
including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临恶意客户端攻击和激励高质量数据贡献的挑战，需要在严格隐私要求下确保安全性和参与度。

Method: 使用主动警报机制和鲁棒聚合防御拜占庭和推理攻击，采用Tullock竞赛启发的激励机制，将服务器与客户端交互建模为两阶段Stackelberg博弈。

Result: 实验表明CoSIFL在提高模型鲁棒性和降低服务器总成本方面优于现有解决方案，证明了集成设计的有效性。

Conclusion: CoSIFL通过集成安全、隐私和激励机制，成功解决了联邦学习中的安全威胁和参与激励问题，实现了高效协作学习。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data locality. However, it still faces
challenges from malicious or compromised clients, as well as difficulties in
incentivizing participants to contribute high-quality data under strict privacy
requirements. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CoSIFL, a novel
framework that integrates proactive alarming for robust security and local
differential privacy (LDP) for inference attacks, together with a
Stackelberg-based incentive scheme to encourage client participation and data
sharing. Specifically, CoSIFL uses an active alarming mechanism and robust
aggregation to defend against Byzantine and inference attacks, while a Tullock
contest-inspired incentive module rewards honest clients for both data
contributions and reliable alarm triggers. We formulate the interplay between
the server and clients as a two-stage game: in the first stage, the server
determines total rewards, selects participants, and fixes global iteration
settings, whereas in the second stage, each client decides its mini-batch size,
privacy noise scale, and alerting strategy. We prove that the server-client
game admits a unique equilibrium, and analyze how clients' multi-dimensional
attributes - such as non-IID degrees and privacy budgets - jointly affect
system efficiency. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in improving model robustness and
reducing total server costs, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated
design.

TL;DR: 本文首次全面研究了MXFP4和NVFP4两种4位浮点格式在LLM后训练量化中的实际表现，揭示了其承诺与现实性能之间的差距，并提出MR-GPTQ方法来解决FP4量化中的关键问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件加速的4位浮点格式（MXFP4和NVFP4）承诺革新LLM推理，但其实际效益尚未得到验证。本文旨在填补这一空白，评估这些格式的实际性能并解决其量化挑战。

Method: 提出Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ)方法，通过块级Hadamard变换和格式特定优化来定制FP4量化过程，并开发高性能GPU内核实现旋转融合和快速在线激活计算。

Result: MR-GPTQ在NVIDIA B200上实现层级3.6倍和端到端2.2倍加速，在RTX5090上实现层级6倍和端到端4倍加速，显著提升MXFP4精度使其接近NVFP4水平。

Conclusion: 虽然FP4不是INT4的自动升级，但像MR-GPTQ这样的格式专用方法可以解锁精度-性能权衡的新前沿。

Abstract: The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats
such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to
revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical
benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and
NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and
real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods
struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably
neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two
scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the
classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to
FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and
format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of
high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible
overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of
the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and
2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on
RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches
or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the
point where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an
automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock
a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.

Motivation: 现有的上下文强化学习方法在测试时无法像训练数据那样持续改进性能，存在上下文模糊性问题，即模型自身的随机动作可能生成与训练数据中次优策略相似的交互历史，导致性能下降的恶性循环。

Method: 提出CV-ICRL方法，在训练阶段引入上下文价值作为显式信号，表示给定当前上下文时策略理论上可达到的理想性能。随着上下文扩展，上下文价值应非递减。提出了两种在训练和测试时估计上下文价值的方法。

Result: 在Dark Room和Minigrid测试平台上的实验表明，CV-ICRL有效缓解了性能下降问题，并在各种任务和环境中提高了ICRL的整体能力。

Conclusion: CV-ICRL通过上下文价值解决了上下文强化学习中的上下文模糊性问题，为开发能够持续改进的智能体提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past
experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches
train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online
RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our
experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a
continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,
we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own
stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly
resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a
vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we
introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed
ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing
the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current
context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant
information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We
prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap
relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two
methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time.
Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that
CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL
abilities across various tasks and environments. The source code and data of
this paper are available at

Result: 7B参数模型在WirelessMathBench-XL上达到39.5%准确率，接近GPT-4o（40.4%），但参数量减少约100倍；GRPO训练使所有模型规模性能几乎翻倍，并在未训练过的通用数学基准上平均提升8.4分。

Conclusion: 紧凑模型通过领域特定的强化学习可以在专业数学任务上达到与大型模型相媲美的性能，同时具备向通用数学任务的积极迁移能力，验证了可验证正确性在强化学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general mathematical reasoning but fail
catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics. In wireless
communications, where problems require precise manipulation of
information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing
formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent
performance. We present WirelessMathLM, demonstrating that compact models
(0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through
domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight
is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique property--verifiable
correctness--that enables effective reinforcement learning without human
feedback. We construct WirelessMathBench-XL, a comprehensive benchmark of 4,027
problems from 970 papers. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
binary verification rewards, we train models directly from base checkpoints
without supervised warm-start. Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on
WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using about 100 times
fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). Remarkably, GRPO training
nearly doubles performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B
+81%), with positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks--our models
gain +8.4 points on average across MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地依赖带可验证奖励的强化学习来激发可靠的思维链推理，但训练过程受限于计算昂贵的rollout阶段。现有加速方法存在收益递减、引入偏差或忽略迭代间冗余的问题。

Method: 提出SPEC-RL框架，集成推测解码与RL rollout过程，重用先前的轨迹段作为推测前缀，通过草稿-验证机制扩展，避免冗余生成同时确保策略一致性。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500、OlympiadBench、MMLU-STEM等数学推理和泛化基准测试中，SPEC-RL将rollout时间减少2-3倍，且不损害策略质量。

Conclusion: SPEC-RL作为纯rollout阶段增强方法，可与主流算法（如PPO、GRPO、DAPO）无缝集成，为大规模推理模型的RLVR扩展提供了通用实用的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

imbalanced regression (DIR) represents cases where the input data are
high-dimensional and unstructured. Although several data-level approaches for
tabular imbalanced regression exist, deep imbalanced regression currently lacks
dedicated data-level solutions suitable for high-dimensional data and relies
primarily on algorithmic modifications. To fill this gap, we propose
LatentDiff, a novel framework that uses conditional diffusion models with
priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent
representation space. LatentDiff is computationally efficient and applicable
across diverse data modalities, including images, text, and other
high-dimensional inputs. Experiments on three DIR benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall
accuracy.

### [127] [Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy for LLMs: Not All Tokens Require Equal Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23246)
*Manjiang Yu,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li,Yang Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ATDP方法，通过自适应地为敏感和非敏感token分配不同梯度权重，在保护敏感信息的同时显著减少DP训练时间，仅需少量额外epoch的轻量级后处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs经常记忆敏感或个人信息，现有DPSGD方法在所有梯度步骤注入均匀噪声，显著延长训练时间并降低模型准确性。

Method: ATDP是DP-SGD的改进版本，自适应地为敏感和非敏感token分配不同梯度权重，在训练早期使用更大噪声尺度快速破坏敏感内容记忆，仅需少量额外epoch的轻量级后处理。

Result: ATDP将DP微调计算开销减少约90%，训练时间显著缩短，同时实现可比或更优的隐私保护，准确率下降最小。

Conclusion: ATDP可无缝集成到现有DP微调流程中，或直接应用于非私有模型作为快速隐私增强措施，结合初始编辑微调阶段形成简化的DP流程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal
information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of
differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise
into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing
model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients
associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time,
strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve
the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight
through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of
vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive
and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage
of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a
result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight
post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise
primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally
affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated
into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to
non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined
with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP
pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD
methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning,
shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving
comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于神经网络的高维参数空间子空间回归方法，通过预测比所需维度更大的子空间来降低学习复杂度并提高精度，应用于参数化偏微分方程求解等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数化降阶建模中，高维参数空间使得经典插值策略不可行或不可靠，需要更有效的子空间近似方法。

Method: 将插值问题松弛为回归问题，引入适合子空间数据的损失函数，使用神经网络近似高维目标函数，并通过预测更大维度的子空间来简化学习问题。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法降低了椭圆特征问题的映射复杂度，并使Grassmann流形上的光滑映射更平滑；实证结果显示预测更大子空间能显著提高精度。

Conclusion: 子空间回归方法在参数特征问题、紧缩技术、松弛方法、最优控制和参数化偏微分方程求解等任务中具有实用价值。

Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear
subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach
becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on
parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute
subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding
offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown
parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is
high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible
or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression,
introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural
network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further
simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting
subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically
that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic
eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for
general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show
that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are
predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace
regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric
eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and
solution of parametric partial differential equations.

Abstract: We present NanoFlux, a novel adversarial framework for generating targeted
training data to improve LLM reasoning, where adversarially-generated datasets
containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning
approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models
alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge,
synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target
specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on
NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains
compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning
(GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical
reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x.
Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset
characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal
points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates
training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering,
tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future
model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely
targeted training datasets.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interfaces is critical for
vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development.
However, achieving reliable predictions from sequences alone remains a
challenge. In this paper, we present ABCONFORMER, a model based on the
Conformer backbone that captures both local and global features of a
biosequence. To accurately capture Ab-Ag interactions, we introduced the
physics-inspired sliding attention, enabling residue-level contact recovery
without relying on three-dimensional structural data. ABConformer can
accurately predict paratopes and epitopes given the antibody and antigen
sequence, and predict pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information.
In comparison experiments, ABCONFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on
a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, and surpasses widely used sequence-based
methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation studies further
quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that, compared to
conventional cross-attention, sliding attention significantly enhances the
precision of epitope prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, we will release
the code under an open-source license upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型推理时控制方法主要依赖启发式指导或与SMC结合进行偏差校正，需要更灵活高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用副本交换算法，设计CREPE方法，实现序列化生成粒子、保持样本多样性，并支持在线优化和提前终止。

Result: 在温度退火、奖励倾斜、模型组合和分类器自由指导去偏等多种任务中表现优异，性能与现有SMC方法相当。

Conclusion: CREPE为扩散模型推理时控制提供了灵活高效的解决方案，在保持性能的同时具备更好的实用性和适应性。

Abstract: Inference-time control of diffusion models aims to steer model outputs to
satisfy new constraints without retraining. Previous approaches have mostly
relied on heuristic guidance or have been coupled with Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) for bias correction. In this paper, we propose a flexible alternative
based on replica exchange, an algorithm designed initially for sampling
problems. We refer to this method as the CREPE (Controlling with REPlica
Exchange). Unlike SMC, CREPE: (1) generates particles sequentially, (2)
maintains high diversity in the generated samples after a burn-in period, and
(3) enables online refinement or early termination. We demonstrate its
versatility across various tasks, including temperature annealing,
reward-tilting, model composition and classifier-free guidance debiasing, with
competitive performance compared to prior SMC methods.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种机器学习方法（迁移学习、从头训练ML和集成整合）在乳腺癌生存预后中的表现，发现这些方法在PREDICT v3工具信息缺失或数据集偏移的情况下能改善预后预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因组预后工具成本高且可及性差，而临床病理预后更经济易得。机器学习、迁移学习和集成整合为构建稳健的预后框架提供了机会。

Method: 使用MA.27试验数据训练模型，在TEAM试验和SEER队列中进行外部验证。比较了三种方法：迁移学习（微调PREDICT v3）、从头训练ML（随机生存森林和极端梯度提升）和集成整合（模型预测的加权和）。

Result: 迁移学习、从头训练RSF和集成整合在MA.27中改善了校准（ICI从0.042降至≤0.007），区分度保持相当（AUC从0.738升至0.744-0.799）。ML模型能处理PREDICT v3无法预测的23.8-25.8%病例。年龄、淋巴结状态、病理分级和肿瘤大小是最重要的预后因素。

Conclusion: 在PREDICT v3相关信息缺失或数据集偏移的情况下，迁移学习、从头训练RSF和集成整合能改善乳腺癌预后预测。

Abstract: Prognostic information is essential for decision-making in breast cancer
management. Recently trials have predominantly focused on genomic
prognostication tools, even though clinicopathological prognostication is less
costly and more widely accessible. Machine learning (ML), transfer learning and
ensemble integration offer opportunities to build robust prognostication
frameworks. We evaluate this potential to improve survival prognostication in
breast cancer by comparing de-novo ML, transfer learning from a pre-trained
prognostic tool and ensemble integration. Data from the MA.27 trial was used
for model training, with external validation on the TEAM trial and a SEER
cohort. Transfer learning was applied by fine-tuning the pre-trained prognostic
tool PREDICT v3, de-novo ML included Random Survival Forests and Extreme
Gradient Boosting, and ensemble integration was realized through a weighted sum
of model predictions. Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration
improved calibration in MA.27 over the pre-trained model (ICI reduced from
0.042 in PREDICT v3 to <=0.007) while discrimination remained comparable (AUC
increased from 0.738 in PREDICT v3 to 0.744-0.799). Invalid PREDICT v3
predictions were observed in 23.8-25.8% of MA.27 individuals due to missing
information. In contrast, ML models and ensemble integration could predict
survival regardless of missing information. Across all models, patient age,
nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size had the highest SHAP values,
indicating their importance for survival prognostication. External validation
in SEER, but not in TEAM, confirmed the benefits of transfer learning, RSF and
ensemble integration. This study demonstrates that transfer learning, de-novo
RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication in situations where
relevant information for PREDICT v3 is lacking or where a dataset shift is
likely.

Motivation: 传统资产负债管理方法难以有效平衡资产与负债，需要一种能够动态同步两者并兼顾中期和最终目标的更优策略。

Method: 采用模型无关的策略梯度软演员-评论家算法，为演员引入自适应探索机制，为评论家引入调度探索机制，以平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在200个随机市场情景中测试，该方法在所有替代策略中获得了更高的平均奖励，具有快速初始收益和持续优异表现。

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接学习最优ALM策略而非学习环境，实现了优于传统金融策略和现有RL算法的性能，且不依赖复杂神经网络或改进的参数估计。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by
employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic
(LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We
develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm
tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure
an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning,
we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for
the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced
traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and
three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market
scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative
strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The
outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter
estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without
learning the environment.

Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic
management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. This paper
introduces NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Flight
Dynamics Model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. By combining
analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components, NODE-FDM achieves a
more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art
models such as a BADA-based trajectory generation methodology (BADA4
performance model combined with trajectory control routines), particularly in
the descent phase of the flight. The analysis demonstrates marked improvements
across altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. Despite current limitations,
including limited physical constraints and the limited availability of QAR
data, the results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed neural ordinary
differential equations as a high-fidelity, data-driven approach to aircraft
performance modelling. Future work will extend the framework to incorporate a
full modelling of the lateral dynamics of the aircraft.

<details>

Method: ASTGI框架包含四个模块：时空点表示模块将离散观测编码为可学习嵌入空间中的点；邻域自适应图构建模块通过最近邻搜索为每个点自适应构建因果图；时空动态传播模块基于点间相对时空位置生成消息并计算交互权重，迭代更新自适应因果图上的信息；基于查询点的预测模块通过聚合邻域信息进行回归预测。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，ASTGI优于各种最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ASTGI框架通过自适应图构建和动态传播机制，有效解决了不规则多元时间序列预测中的核心挑战，在多个领域展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains
like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive
decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals
inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to
accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without
introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex
dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges,
we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework.
Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point
Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a
learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive
Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in
the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a
Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on
these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction
weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points.
Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by
aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing
regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 循环深度transformer的迭代更新呈现两尺度特性，基于二阶差分的早退机制是更优的退出策略。

Abstract: Recurrent-depth transformers scale test-time compute by iterating latent
computations before emitting tokens. We study the geometry of these iterates
and argue for a simple, \emph{two-scale} operational picture: (i) within a
looped block, updates act as \emph{small-scale refinements}; (ii) across
consecutive blocks, states undergo a \emph{larger-scale drift}. Across
checkpoints, our measurements show that loop steps become \emph{smaller} and
increasingly \emph{orthogonal} to one another, indicating better local modeling
of fine structure rather than merely pushing in a single direction. These
dynamics motivate an early-exit mechanism based on the model's second-order
difference in step-size, which we show is superior in terms of performance,
stability and time-efficiency, when compared to the KL-divergence exit strategy
of Geiping et al. and its naive first-order counterpart.

Abstract: Regression is essential across many domains but remains challenging in
high-dimensional settings, where existing methods often lose spatial structure
or demand heavy storage. In this work, we address the problem of matrix-valued

MELCOT, a hybrid model that integrates a classical machine learning-based
Marginal Estimation (ME) block with a deep learning-based Learnable-Cost
Optimal Transport (LCOT) block. The ME block estimates data marginals to
preserve spatial information, while the LCOT block learns complex global
features. This design enables MELCOT to inherit the strengths of both classical

Conclusion: 同时建模时间和瞬时概念关系能够显著提升LLMs的可解释性。

Abstract: Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their
internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability
tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract
interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling,
instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical
guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical
confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation
learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent
concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to
inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable
temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for
LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and
instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees
and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world
complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we
successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our
findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual
relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern
machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to
simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to
adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust
pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less
understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from
such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust
models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to
poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In
challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting
performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find
that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the
beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we
propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over
perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer.
Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures
performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive
evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test
time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained
models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully
prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected
robustness.

Abstract: The Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and its dynamic counterpart, the
Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) problem, play an important role in modern machine
learning, linking generative modeling with optimal transport theory. While
recent advances in discrete diffusion and flow models have sparked growing
interest in applying SB methods to discrete domains, there is still no reliable
way to evaluate how well these methods actually solve the underlying problem.
We address this challenge by introducing a benchmark for SB on discrete spaces.
Our construction yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically
known SB solutions, enabling rigorous evaluation. As a byproduct of building
this benchmark, we obtain two new SB algorithms, DLightSB and DLightSB-M, and
additionally extend prior related work to construct the $\alpha$-CSBM
algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark by evaluating both
existing and new solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings. This work
provides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete
spaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies.

*Hanlin Zhu,Shibo Hao,Zhiting Hu,Jiantao Jiao,Stuart Russell,Yuandong Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从理论上分析了连续思维链（continuous CoT）在训练过程中如何自然学习叠加机制，揭示了两阶段训练动态：思维生成阶段和预测阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补连续CoT中叠加机制如何通过梯度训练自然学习的理论空白，理解模型在推理过程中如何平衡探索与利用。

Method: 理论分析简化双层transformer在有向图可达性问题上的训练动态，跟踪索引匹配logit的变化，并通过实验验证理论。

Result: 发现索引匹配logit在训练中先增长后保持有界，这种有界性使模型能够平衡探索与利用，在不确定时给多个推理路径分配相似权重，形成叠加机制。

Conclusion: 连续CoT训练过程中自然涌现的叠加机制源于索引匹配logit的有界性，这种机制使模型能够有效平衡局部搜索与多路径探索。

Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT)
improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling
implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight
by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can
efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of
multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains
unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from
gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the
training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph
reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during
training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that
autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage
that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that
during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an
important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search
ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions.
The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and
exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem
structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights
to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is
correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the
growth of logits further validate our theory.

*Ange-Clément Akazan,Verlon Roel Mbingui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(KANs)的特征选择方法，包括KAN-L1、KAN-L2、KAN-SI、KAN-KO四种选择器，在表格数据集上与传统方法相比表现出竞争力，特别是在结构化和合成数据集中有时更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据集需要有效的特征选择来提高预测性能、可解释性和鲁棒性。KANs通过样条参数化特征变换，可以直接获得可解释的重要性度量。

Method: 引入四种KAN基选择器(KAN-L1、KAN-L2、KAN-SI、KAN-KO)，在多个分类和回归表格数据集基准上与经典基线方法(LASSO、随机森林、互信息、SVM-RFE)进行比较。

Result: KAN基选择器在结构化和合成数据集中与传统方法竞争且有时更优。KAN-L2和KAN-SI在噪声回归数据集和异质数据集上表现稳健，与集成预测器表现接近。在分类任务中，KAN选择器有时通过消除冗余而超越其他选择器。

Conclusion: KAN基特征选择为传统方法提供了强大且可解释的替代方案，能够发现超越稀疏性或基于不纯度度量的非线性和多变量特征相关性。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets require effective feature selection to improve
predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness. We propose and
evaluate feature selection methods for tabular datasets based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), which parameterize feature transformations
through splines, enabling direct access to interpretable importance measures.
We introduce four KAN-based selectors ($\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-SI}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$) and compare them against classical
baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) across multiple
classification and regression tabular dataset benchmarks. Average (over three
retention levels: 20\%, 40\%, and 60\%) F1 scores and $R^2$ score results
reveal that KAN-based selectors, particularly $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, and $\textit{KAN-KO}$, are competitive
with and sometimes superior to classical baselines in structured and synthetic
datasets. However, $\textit{KAN-L1}$ is often too aggressive in regression,
removing useful features, while $\textit{KAN-L2}$ underperforms in
classification, where simple coefficient shrinkage misses complex feature
interactions. $\textit{KAN-L2}$ and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ provide robust
performance on noisy regression datasets and heterogeneous datasets, aligning
closely with ensemble predictors. In classification tasks, KAN selectors such
as $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$, and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ sometimes
surpass the other selectors by eliminating redundancy, particularly in
high-dimensional multi-class data. Overall, our findings demonstrate that
KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and interpretable alternative
to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate
feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures.

*Xi Ding,Lei Wang,Piotr Koniusz,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了图一致性正则化(GCR)框架，通过将模型预测生成的关系图结构注入学习过程，促进类感知的语义特征表示。该框架作为自提示机制，让模型利用自身输出来优化内部结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络学习到的丰富表示往往包含与模型预测语义相矛盾的噪声类间相似性。GCR旨在解决这一问题，通过图对齐机制确保特征级关系反映类一致的预测行为。

Method: 在任意深度引入参数自由的图一致性层(GCLs)，构建批次级特征相似图，并将其与全局类感知掩码预测图对齐。采用多层跨空间图对齐机制和自适应权重学习，根据图差异大小学习层重要性。

Result: GCR在各种网络和数据集上都能改善语义结构，促进更清晰的特征结构、更强的类内凝聚力和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GCR提供了一种从预测结构学习的新视角，是模型无关、轻量级的方法，无需修改架构或训练过程即可提升特征质量。

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that
injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the
learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature
representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model
to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks
learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities
that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by
introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths.
Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a
global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax
prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces
that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior,
acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR
introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive
weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes.
This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress
noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or
training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic
structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR
promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved
generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction
structure. [Project website](https://darcyddx.github.io/gcr/)

TL;DR: 本文提出PAPL方法，通过改进离散扩散模型的训练目标来解决训练与推理路径不匹配问题，在蛋白质序列建模、文本生成和代码生成任务中取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过规划器实现灵活并行生成，但规划器修改了反向路径，导致训练时的均匀随机去噪路径与推理时的规划路径不匹配。

Method: 推导了计划证据下界(P-ELBO)，提出Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL)方法，将规划器反向动态直接纳入训练目标，改进标准掩码离散扩散损失。

Result: 在蛋白质序列建模中相对提升40%，文本生成MAUVE指标提升高达4倍，代码生成HumanEval pass@10相对提升23%。

Conclusion: PAPL通过使训练与推理在规划去噪器下对齐，在多个领域实现了显著性能提升，证明了理论推导的有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to
autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel
generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or
planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather
than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths,
planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used
during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work,
we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the
standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not
accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap,
we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly
incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective.
Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and
effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that
aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL
delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain
in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text
generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多视图边缘分类的多重图链接预测方法，使用跨层自注意力机制融合不同层的信息，并设计了两种模型实例和防泄漏协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么压缩层信息，要么独立处理各层，这会导致丢失关键的跨层依赖关系，并且难以扩展到大规模图。

Method: 将多重链接预测构建为多视图边缘分类问题，为每个节点对构建每层边缘视图序列，应用跨层自注意力融合目标层证据。提出了Trans-SLE（基于静态嵌入）和Trans-GAT（结合层特定GAT编码器）两种模型，并引入Union-Set候选池和两种无泄漏协议。

Result: 在六个公共多重数据集上的实验显示，相比强基线方法（MELL、HOPLP-MUL、RMNE）取得了持续的macro-F1提升。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，且兼容预计算嵌入和GNN编码器，有效解决了多重图链接预测中的跨层依赖和可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Multiplex graphs capture diverse relations among shared nodes. Most
predictors either collapse layers or treat them independently. This loses
crucial inter-layer dependencies and struggles with scalability. To overcome
this, we frame multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification. For
each node pair, we construct a sequence of per-layer edge views and apply
cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence for the target layer. We present
two models as instances of this framework: Trans-SLE, a lightweight transformer
over static embeddings, and Trans-GAT, which combines layer-specific GAT
encoders with transformer fusion. To ensure scalability and fairness, we
introduce a Union--Set candidate pool and two leakage-free protocols:
cross-layer and inductive subgraph generalization. Experiments on six public
multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F_1 gains over strong baselines (MELL,
HOPLP-MUL, RMNE). Our approach is simple, scalable, and compatible with both
precomputed embeddings and GNN encoders.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PATCH是一种混合稀疏框架，通过将权重矩阵划分为块，让每个块选择为密集或2:4稀疏，实现了0%到50%之间的连续稀疏比，在保持准确性的同时提供实际加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型剪枝方法面临两难：非结构化稀疏保持准确性但无法GPU加速，而半结构化2:4稀疏硬件友好但强制50%模式会降低模型质量。需要一种能平衡准确性和加速的灵活稀疏方法。

Method: 将权重矩阵划分为块，通过可学习的掩码选择机制为每个块分配密集或2:4稀疏模式，支持非均匀跨层稀疏和细粒度控制精度-加速权衡。

Result: 在0.5B到8B参数模型上，PATCH持续缩小与密集模型的准确性差距并提供实际加速。在LLaMA-2 7B上，相比密集基线实现1.18x-1.38x端到端加速，相比最先进的2:4剪枝方法MaskLLM提高准确性0.37%-2.96%。

Conclusion: PATCH框架成功地在模型准确性和计算效率之间建立了更好的平衡，为大型语言模型的部署提供了有效的稀疏解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur
prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an
effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face
challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere,
preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU
acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but
enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap,
we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous
sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles,
assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask
selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over
accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across
layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B
parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while
delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU,
PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while
improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning
method, MaskLLM.

TL;DR: URS是一个统一的神经路由求解器，能够在零样本情况下泛化到100多种车辆路径问题变体，无需微调。通过统一数据表示、混合偏置模块和参数生成器实现跨问题泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经求解器依赖预定义约束或需要针对每个问题进行微调，限制了零样本泛化能力。需要开发能够处理多种未见VRP变体的统一模型。

Method: 提出统一数据表示(UDR)替代问题枚举，混合偏置模块(MBM)学习几何和关系偏置，参数生成器自适应调整解码器和偏置权重，以及LLM驱动的约束满足机制。

Result: URS能够在零样本情况下为100多种不同的VRP变体（包括90多种未见变体）持续产生高质量解，是首个能处理100+VRP变体的单一神经求解器。

Conclusion: URS通过统一表示和自适应机制实现了强大的零样本泛化能力，为神经路由求解器在多问题场景中的应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Multi-task neural routing solvers have emerged as a promising paradigm for
their ability to solve multiple vehicle routing problems (VRPs) using a single
model. However, existing neural solvers typically rely on predefined problem
constraints or require per-problem fine-tuning, which substantially limits
their zero-shot generalization ability to unseen VRP variants. To address this
critical bottleneck, we propose URS, a unified neural routing solver capable of
zero-shot generalization across a wide range of unseen VRPs using a single
model without any fine-tuning. The key component of URS is the unified data
representation (UDR), which replaces problem enumeration with data unification,
thereby broadening the problem coverage and reducing reliance on domain
expertise. In addition, we propose a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to efficiently
learn the geometric and relational biases inherent in various problems. On top
of the proposed UDR, we further develop a parameter generator that adaptively
adjusts the decoder and bias weights of MBM to enhance zero-shot
generalization. Moreover, we propose an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction
mechanism, which translates raw problem descriptions into executable stepwise
masking functions to ensure solution feasibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that URS can consistently produce high-quality solutions for more
than 100 distinct VRP variants without any fine-tuning, which includes more
than 90 unseen variants. To the best of our knowledge, URS is the first neural
solver capable of handling over 100 VRP variants with a single model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOTFormer是一种同时具备线性时间复杂度和双重随机性的注意力机制，通过将注意力映射重新表述为查询和键之间的低秩传输计划来解决传统注意力机制的计算复杂度和注意力分布不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax注意力机制存在二次复杂度问题，限制了其在长上下文窗口中的扩展性。同时，大多数注意力机制产生的行归一化映射会导致注意力过度集中在少数token上，影响模型的鲁棒性和信息流动。现有双重随机注意力机制虽然能平衡token参与度，但通常引入大量计算开销。

Method: 将注意力映射重新表述为查询和键之间的传输计划，通过引入可学习的枢轴度量来约束传输计划为低秩。具体通过求解两个熵最优传输问题（查询→枢轴和枢轴→键），并将它们组合成条件耦合，从而生成双重随机、秩至多为r的注意力矩阵，时间复杂度为O(nr)。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中取得最先进的结果，在准确性和效率方面均优于先前的线性和基于传输的注意力方法。

Conclusion: LOTFormer提供了一种原则性的方法，同时实现了线性时间复杂度和双重随机性，有效解决了注意力机制的可扩展性和注意力分布平衡问题。

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities.
However, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism
poses a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large
body of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention
as a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve
linear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention
mechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can
over-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow.
Enforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token
participation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention
mechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability.
We propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously
linear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between
attention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The
central idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning
it on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two
entropic optimal transport problems (queries $\to$ pivot and pivot $\to$ keys)
and compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention
matrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \ll n$, and
applies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \times n$ map.
The pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end. Empirically, LOTFormer
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing
prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and
efficiency.

Motivation: 用户隐私保护和法规遵从要求在模型训练中移除敏感数据，但这一过程通常会导致分布偏移，特别是在分布外场景下损害模型性能。

Method: 引入判别保持因子去相关模块（使用动态自适应权重调整和迭代表示更新）和平滑数据移除机制（通过损失扰动创建信息论保护）。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于其他基线方法，即使在显著分布偏移下也能持续实现高预测准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在分布内和分布外场景中均表现出卓越的效率和适应性，为隐私保护模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The imperative of user privacy protection and regulatory compliance
necessitates sensitive data removal in model training, yet this process often
induces distributional shifts that undermine model performance-particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We propose a novel data removal approach
that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss
perturbation. Our approach introduces: (1) a discriminative-preserving factor
decorrelation module employing dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative
representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and minimize inter-feature
correlations. (2) a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that
creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal
operations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our
approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive
accuracy and robustness even under significant distribution shifts. The results
highlight its superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution scenarios.

Result: 在ELM生物地球化学自旋工作流中，PHASE仅用前20年模拟数据就能推断出近平衡状态，相比传统方法的1200年集成时间，实现了至少60倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: PHASE能够捕捉控制物理规律而非表面相关性，为陆地表面建模和其他复杂科学工作流程提供了实用且物理一致的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations underpin modern scientific discovery but
remain constrained by prohibitive computational costs. AI surrogates offer
acceleration, yet adoption in mission-critical settings is limited by concerns
over physical plausibility, trustworthiness, and the fusion of heterogeneous
data. We introduce PHASE, a modular deep-learning framework for
physics-integrated, heterogeneity-aware surrogates in scientific simulations.
PHASE combines data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs with
multi-level physics-based constraints that promote consistency from local
dynamics to global system behavior. We validate PHASE on the biogeochemical
(BGC) spin-up workflow of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth
System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), presenting-to our knowledge-the first
scientifically validated AI-accelerated solution for this task. Using only the
first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that otherwise
requires more than 1,200 years of integration, yielding an effective reduction
in required integration length by at least 60x. The framework is enabled by a
pipeline for fusing heterogeneous scientific data and demonstrates strong
generalization to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning. These
results indicate that PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather
than surface correlations, enabling practical, physically consistent
acceleration of land-surface modeling and other complex scientific workflows.

Motivation: 解决现有基于种群的MARL方法（如PSRO）需要存储显式策略种群和构建完整支付矩阵，导致二次计算和线性内存成本的问题。

Method: 使用紧凑的潜在锚点和单个摊销生成器，通过无偏蒙特卡洛推演、乘法权重元动力学和无模型经验伯恩斯坦UCB预言机自适应扩展策略集，在生成器内使用基于优势的信任域目标训练最佳响应。

Conclusion: GEMS在保持PSRO博弈论保证的同时克服了其基本低效性，实现了多个领域的可扩展多智能体学习。

Abstract: Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central
challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response
Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing
full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs.
We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free
framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent
anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing
the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts,
multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB
oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within
the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the
need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of
Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn
Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster,
has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards
simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic
guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence
enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.

Motivation: 实时操作中需要频繁求解计算密集的MILP问题，但何时重新求解是一个经济上重要的问题，现有方法主要关注启发式、低数据设置和平滑目标。

Method: 提出POC框架（Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection），结合近端策略优化和变点检测，系统性地平衡性能与重求解成本。

Result: 在8个合成和真实数据集上测试，POC始终优于现有基线方法2%-17%。

Conclusion: POC框架有效解决了MILP重求解时机决策问题，同时填补了实时MILP基准测试的文献空白。

Abstract: A common challenge in real-time operations is deciding whether to re-solve an
optimization problem or continue using an existing solution. While modern data
platforms may collect information at high frequencies, many real-time
operations require repeatedly solving computationally intensive optimization
problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Determining when
to re-solve is, therefore, an economically important question. This problem
poses several challenges: 1) How to characterize solution optimality and
solving cost; 2) How to detect environmental changes and select beneficial
samples for solving the MILP; 3) Given the large time horizon and non-MDP
structure, vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods are not directly
applicable and tend to suffer from value function explosion. Existing
literature largely focuses on heuristics, low-data settings, and smooth
objectives, with little focus on common NP-hard MILPs. We propose a framework
called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC), which
systematically offers a solution for balancing performance and cost when
deciding appropriate re-solving times. Theoretically, we establish the
relationship between the number of re-solves and the re-solving cost. To test
our framework, we assemble eight synthetic and real-world datasets, and show
that POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17%. As a side
benefit, our work fills the gap in the literature by introducing real-time MILP
benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Drift-Adapter是一种轻量级可学习转换层，通过将新查询映射到旧嵌入空间，避免生产向量数据库升级时重新编码整个语料库和重建ANN索引，显著降低操作中断和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生产向量数据库升级嵌入模型通常需要重新编码整个语料库和重建ANN索引，导致显著的操作中断和计算成本，需要一种更轻量级的升级方案。

Method: 提出Drift-Adapter转换层，系统评估三种参数化方法：正交Procrustes、低秩仿射变换和紧凑残差MLP，在少量新旧嵌入对样本上训练。

Result: 在MTEB文本语料和CLIP图像模型升级实验中，Drift-Adapter恢复95-99%的检索召回率，查询延迟增加小于10微秒，相比完全重索引降低100倍以上的重计算成本。

Conclusion: Drift-Adapter作为实用解决方案，可实现近乎零操作中断的敏捷模型部署，具有对模型漂移、训练数据大小和可扩展性的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Upgrading embedding models in production vector databases typically requires
re-encoding the entire corpus and rebuilding the Approximate Nearest Neighbor
(ANN) index, leading to significant operational disruption and computational
cost. This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable
transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model
versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter
enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full
re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations:
Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on
a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text
corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter
recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full
re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to
operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving,
Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates
upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to
varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems,
and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating
Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.

*Jiang-Xin Shi,Wen-Da Wei,Jin-Fei Qi,Xuanyu Chen,Tong Wei,Yu-Feng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LoRAct方法，通过低秩激活压缩减少参数高效微调中的内存开销，在保持性能的同时将激活内存减少约80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数高效微调范式虽然减少了可训练参数数量，但其高内存开销仍是阻碍实际部署的关键瓶颈，特别是模型激活在大批次和长上下文下消耗大量内存。

Method: 提出LoRAct方法，基于观察到的激活矩阵低秩特性，采用在线压缩策略，无需校准数据，并设计了基于采样的正交分解算法来处理低秩矩阵。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上的实验表明，LoRAct相比广泛采用的LoRA方法进一步减少了约80%的激活内存，同时保持竞争力性能。

Conclusion: LoRAct提供了一种灵活高效的内存优化方案，解决了参数高效微调中的内存瓶颈问题。

Abstract: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant
attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods
have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their
substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders
practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations
constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch
sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains
consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient
fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior
work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that
can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any
calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based
orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices,
offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared
to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces
activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted
LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在分布偏移下性能下降，需要探索仅依赖历史数据能否实现对未来数据的泛化。

Method: 研究了两种主要方法：参数插值（历史模型参数的凸组合）和参数外推（超出历史参数凸包的外推），并在多个时序任务上进行基准测试。

Result: 在所有评估场景中，没有任何方法能始终优于简单使用最新可用模型参数的基线方法。

Conclusion: 在没有未来数据或对数据生成过程的稳健假设时，泛化和外推到未来数据存在固有困难，需要谨慎评估此类泛化声明。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

TL;DR: 研究优化器选择对量化模型性能的影响，发现Shampoo优化器在量化感知训练中表现最佳，并推导了不同优化器下的量化感知训练缩放定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着新优化器的普及和模型量化成为高效部署的标准，需要系统研究优化器选择如何影响量化后的模型性能。目前关于优化器与量化之间相互作用的系统性证据仍然有限。

Method: 首先用六种优化器训练全精度模型（参数范围50M到1.5B），探索超参数空间并建立良好调优的基线。然后应用后训练量化评估不同优化器训练模型的性能退化，并分析量化感知训练下的性能表现。

Result: 发现与异常值相关的指标（如最大均值比和峰度）无法预测不同优化器的后训练量化性能。在量化感知训练中，原始预训练中表现良好的优化器不一定在量化训练中保持最优，Shampoo优化器显示出最低的准确率退化。

Conclusion: Shampoo优化器在所有测试的优化器中实现了最高的参数效率，并推导了不同优化器下量化感知训练的缩放定律。

Abstract: As new optimizers gain traction and model quantization becomes standard for
efficient deployment, a key question arises: how does the choice of optimizer
affect model performance in the presence of quantization? Despite progress in
both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains
limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model
robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization
(PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision
models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore
the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply
PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different
optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio
(MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different
optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only
isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and
propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized
models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We
find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not
remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest
accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware
training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest
parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态生成模型在处理异构数据时难以有效分离共享和私有信息，特别是在似然模型不足的挑战性数据集上表现不佳。

Method: 使用基于互信息的正则化方法，包括跨视图互信息最大化提取共享变量，循环一致性损失去除冗余，并引入扩散模型增强先验能力。

Result: IDMVAE在挑战性数据集上实现了共享和私有信息的清晰分离，展现出优越的生成质量和语义一致性。

Conclusion: 所提出的组件相互补充，IDMVAE在多模态表示学习中实现了更好的信息解耦和生成性能。

Abstract: Multimodal data are prevalent across various domains, and learning robust
representations of such data is paramount to enhancing generation quality and
downstream task performance. To handle heterogeneity and interconnections among
different modalities, recent multimodal generative models extract shared and
private (modality-specific) information with two separate variables. Despite
attempts to enforce disentanglement between these two variables, these methods
struggle with challenging datasets where the likelihood model is insufficient.
In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to
explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based
regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for
extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy
removal using generative augmentations. We further introduce diffusion models
to improve the capacity of latent priors. These newly proposed components are
complementary to each other. Compared to existing approaches, IDMVAE shows a
clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior
generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMR-EnsembleNet是一个集成框架，结合了基于序列和基于特征的学习方法，使用轻量级1D CNN和XGBoost模型来预测抗生素耐药性，在E. coli数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗生素耐药性（AMR）是全球健康危机，现有计算方法存在局限性：标准机器学习模型忽略SNP的序列上下文，而Transformer等序列模型对中等规模数据集过于数据饥渴和计算昂贵。

Method: 提出AMR-EnsembleNet集成框架，结合轻量级1D CNN（从高维SNP数据学习预测序列模式）和XGBoost模型（捕捉复杂非局部特征交互）。

Result: 在809株E. coli菌株数据集上，该集成模型在所有四种抗生素上都达到顶级性能：CIP的MCC为0.926，GEN的Macro F1-score为0.691，且模型能正确关注已知AMR基因中的SNP。

Conclusion: 将序列感知的1D CNN与基于特征的XGBoost模型融合创建了强大的集成方法，克服了单独使用无序感知或序列模型的局限性。

Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis.
While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes,
current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning
models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the
sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art
sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally
expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To
address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework
that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We
developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data.
This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful
gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature
interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of
809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying
class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier
performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro
F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also
show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes
like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for
resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a
feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the
limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

TL;DR: MosaCD是一种因果发现方法，结合CI测试和LLM标注的高置信度种子，通过置信度下降传播策略构建更准确的因果图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统约束方法依赖完美CI测试和穷举搜索，实践中假设常被违反导致级联错误；现有LLM方法假设完美专家，不适用于易产生幻觉的LLM。

Method: 从CI测试和LLM标注中提取高置信度种子，使用混洗查询过滤幻觉，采用置信度下降传播策略优先定向最可靠的边。

Result: 在多个真实世界图中，MosaCD比现有约束方法在最终图构建中达到更高准确率。

Conclusion: MosaCD通过改进初始种子的可靠性和鲁棒传播策略，显著提升了因果图构建的准确性。

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is central to scientific
modeling and decision-making. Constraint-based methods aim to recover
conditional independence (CI) relations in a causal directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Classical approaches such as PC and subsequent methods orient
v-structures first and then propagate edge directions from these seeds,
assuming perfect CI tests and exhaustive search of separating subsets --
assumptions often violated in practice, leading to cascading errors in the
final graph. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) as
experts, prompting sets of nodes for edge directions, and could augment edge
orientation when assumptions are not met. However, such methods implicitly
assume perfect experts, which is unrealistic for hallucination-prone LLMs. We
propose MosaCD, a causal discovery method that propagates edges from a
high-confidence set of seeds derived from both CI tests and LLM annotations. To
filter hallucinations, we introduce shuffled queries that exploit LLMs'
positional bias, retaining only high-confidence seeds. We then apply a novel
confidence-down propagation strategy that orients the most reliable edges
first, and can be integrated with any skeleton-based discovery method. Across
multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher accuracy in final graph
construction than existing constraint-based methods, largely due to the
improved reliability of initial seeds and robust propagation strategies.

TL;DR: EVO-LRP使用CMA-ES进化策略优化LRP超参数，通过量化可解释性指标提升归因质量，在可解释性指标和视觉一致性方面优于传统XAI方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统XAI方法在细节和可解释性之间存在权衡，LRP实现通常依赖启发式规则集，这些规则未针对清晰度或与模型行为对齐进行优化。

Method: 应用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略(CMA-ES)来调整LRP超参数，基于量化可解释性指标(如忠实度或稀疏度)进行优化。

Result: EVO-LRP在可解释性指标性能和视觉一致性方面优于传统XAI方法，对类别特定特征表现出强敏感性。

Conclusion: 归因质量可以通过原则性的、任务特定的优化得到系统性改进。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多机器学习和科学计算任务涉及高维线性算子，只能通过昂贵的矩阵-向量乘积访问。现有草图方法只能构建低秩或对角近似，但实际算子往往具有更复杂的低秩加对角结构。

Method: 将SKETCHLORD建模为凸优化问题，通过同时估计低秩和对角分量，开发可扩展算法。

Result: 理论和实验证明，联合估计优于任何顺序变体（先对角后低秩或先低秩后对角），在合成数据上准确恢复结构。

Conclusion: SKETCHLORD是结构化近似工具包的有价值补充，特别适用于需要高保真近似的大规模算子，如深度学习Hessian矩阵。

Abstract: Many relevant machine learning and scientific computing tasks involve
high-dimensional linear operators accessible only via costly matrix-vector
products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the
construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few
matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but
approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work
introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank
*and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus*
Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically
that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant
(diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as
a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's
performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a
valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when
high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the
deep learning Hessian.

<details>

Motivation: 传统方法要么维护不断增长的每领域任务向量列表导致可扩展性问题，要么在无法访问旧数据时仅依赖权重空间融合而丢失关键功能信息。需要一种无需访问历史数据且能在恒定内存约束下运行的方法。

Method: 1) 预融合阶段：在主模型的切线空间上对领域特定数据进行微调，增强任务间权重解耦；2) 融合阶段：利用优化器状态中的功能信息，避免仅使用参数平均；3) 融合后阶段：通过校正对齐融合前后模型的表示差异。

Result: 在标准类增量学习和领域增量学习基准测试中，该方法不仅实现了有竞争力的性能，还提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案来应对灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: 该框架通过三阶段干预有效解决了持续学习中的关键挑战，在无需访问历史数据的情况下实现了高性能和可扩展性，为灾难性遗忘问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes
at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to
address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular,
conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task
vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging
when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information.
Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model
within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies
per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task
interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available
optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit
old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation
discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing
overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints
without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard
class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable
and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对扩散模型的秩1 EWC方法，结合重放机制解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限：重放方法需要强生成器且容易分布漂移，EWC假设任务间共享最优解且使用对角Fisher近似。扩散模型已能生成高质量重放数据，但其梯度几何特性未被充分利用

Method: 分析扩散模型在低信噪比下的梯度几何特性，发现梯度高度共线，经验Fisher矩阵近似秩1。提出秩1 EWC变体，成本与对角近似相当但能捕捉主要曲率方向，并与重放方法结合

Result: 在类别增量图像生成任务上（MNIST、FashionMNIST、CIFAR-10、ImageNet-1k），平均FID得到改善，遗忘显著减少。MNIST和FashionMNIST上遗忘几乎消除，ImageNet-1k上遗忘减少约一半

Conclusion: 扩散模型具有近似秩1的Fisher矩阵，改进的Fisher估计使EWC成为重放方法的有效补充：重放促进任务间参数共享，EWC有效约束重放引起的漂移

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in
neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation
(EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to
distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across
tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we
study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce
high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,
in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become
strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and
aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1
variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the
dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach
to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On
class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,
ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces
forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular,
forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved
on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an
approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a
strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks,
while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains,
yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across
datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple
linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant
deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of
linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of
characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free
setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and
explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel
independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the
noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads
to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence
of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need
for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two
complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank
reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank
Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel
adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a
noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our
theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several
settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical
theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust,
interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.

Result: 大量实验表明GraphIFE在多个数据集上持续优于各种基线方法，具有高效性和鲁棒泛化能力

Conclusion: GraphIFE能有效解决图数据类别不平衡问题，通过缓解合成节点质量不一致性显著提升模型性能

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of
samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes
are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a
balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the
challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and
degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency
problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph
imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph
Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality
inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts
from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the
embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to
identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's
efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms
various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 3x3分区和DRIK方法有效解决了信息泄露问题，显著提升了时空估计的分布外泛化性能。

Abstract: Inductive kriging supports high-resolution spatio-temporal estimation with
sparse sensor networks, but conventional training-evaluation setups often
suffer from information leakage and poor out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. We find that the common 2x2 spatio-temporal split allows test
data to influence model selection through early stopping, obscuring the true
OOD characteristics of inductive kriging. To address this issue, we propose a
3x3 partition that cleanly separates training, validation, and test sets,
eliminating leakage and better reflecting real-world applications. Building on
this redefined setting, we introduce DRIK, a Distribution-Robust Inductive
Kriging approach designed with the intrinsic properties of inductive kriging in
mind to explicitly enhance OOD generalization, employing a three-tier strategy
at the node, edge, and subgraph levels. DRIK perturbs node coordinates to
capture continuous spatial relationships, drops edges to reduce ambiguity in
information flow and increase topological diversity, and adds pseudo-labeled
subgraphs to strengthen domain generalization. Experiments on six diverse
spatio-temporal datasets show that DRIK consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving up to 12.48% lower MAE while maintaining strong scalability.

TL;DR: 提出基于虚拟节点的异质图卷积网络VN-HGCN，通过引入虚拟节点增强信息流动，仅需4层即可有效聚合长距离信息，避免过平滑问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异质图神经网络难以捕获长距离信息，或需要堆叠多层导致计算复杂度高和过平滑问题。

Method: 引入虚拟节点作为辅助节点，与特定类型的所有节点相连，促进不同类型节点和边之间的长距离信息高效聚合。

Result: 在三个真实世界异质图数据集上的实验表明，VN-HGCN优于多个最先进的基线模型。

Conclusion: VN-HGCN是一个通用框架，可无缝应用于其他HGNN模型，展示出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful
performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from
various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models
often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking
numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational
complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a
Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which
leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the
graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a
specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range
information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual
nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information
aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can
serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN
models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the
effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
model over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity
among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly
underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the
assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In
our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness
Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are
affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To
eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure
Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing
approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity
imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that
operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also
alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node
neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are
influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of
unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various
benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones. Data and code are available at

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of
probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their
prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains
elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and
model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model
predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay
between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of
post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic
regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds,
and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we
explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance
through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a
diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating
consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By
examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing
only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise
dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability
of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines
for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics
and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical
understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification. Code

Conclusion: UAT框架能够有效解决传统早退策略的局限性，在保持高性能的同时显著提升计算效率，为自适应推理提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Early-Exit Deep Neural Networks enable adaptive inference by allowing
prediction at intermediary layers, significantly reducing computational costs
and latency. Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an
intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined
threshold that is set using a static validation set. This is problematic as the
model might be overconfident in a wrong class. Also, they are not robust to
distribution shifts encountered in deployment, which can undermine model
trustworthiness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose UAT that
adapts the threshold for exit decisions using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework,
enabling online, unsupervised adjustment of exit decisions. UAT makes decisions
based on a new reward function that assesses predictive certainty and its
reliability to balance computational efficiency and prediction quality while
penalizing unnecessary late exits. We provide guarantees on risk achieved by
UAT and validate its performance on diverse tasks spanning vision-language
understanding, text generation, and classification. Our framework demonstrates
consistent improvements in speedup (1.70-2.10x) with a minimal performance drop
(<2%) as compared to full model performance. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文指出传统的知识蒸馏后对齐（KD -> Align）流程会削弱模型对齐稀有但期望行为的能力，提出应该先对齐后蒸馏（Align -> KD）的新流程，以保持参考模型的高召回率特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前效率导向的偏好对齐方法通常在压缩的知识蒸馏模型上进行，但忽视了参考模型分布召回率这一关键属性，导致无法有效对齐稀有但期望的行为。

Method: 1. 提供参考模型如何约束偏好对齐目标的理论解释；2. 在可控的高斯混合实验中验证理论；3. 在SmolLM2系列LLM上验证Align -> KD流程的有效性。

Result: 传统KD -> Align流程导致模型无法有效对齐目标行为，奖励和目标精度显著降低；而Align -> KD流程能稳健对齐这些行为，获得更优的目标导向指标和更低方差。

Conclusion: 参考模型的召回率是对齐中的首要设计选择，必须遵循"对齐先于蒸馏"的原则。

Abstract: For efficiency, preference alignment is often performed on compact,
knowledge-distilled (KD) models. We argue this common practice introduces a
significant limitation by overlooking a key property of the alignment's
reference model: its distributional recall. We show that the standard KD ->
Align workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable
behaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that
reversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first
be performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions
are threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the
reference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental
level. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians
experiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model
performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM
alignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively
align target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target
precision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these
behaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower
variance. Together, these results establish reference-model recall as a
first-order design choice in alignment, offering a clear principle: alignment
must precede distillation.

TL;DR: Hermes框架通过超图网络结合移动聚合和多尺度融合模块，更好地捕捉股票时间序列中的行业相关性，解决了现有方法在行业间领先滞后关系和多尺度信息建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 股票时间序列具有行业相关性，利用这种相关性可以提高预测准确性。现有基于超图的方法只能相对表面地捕捉行业相关性，存在两个关键限制：未充分考虑行业间的领先滞后交互，以及未在行业内部和行业间建模多尺度信息。

Method: 提出Hermes框架，集成移动聚合和多尺度融合模块到超图网络中。具体包括：1）基于超边的移动聚合模块，使用滑动窗口和动态时间聚合操作来灵活捕捉行业间的领先滞后关系；2）跨尺度边到边消息传递，整合不同尺度的信息同时保持各尺度的一致性。

Result: 在多个真实世界股票数据集上的实验结果表明，Hermes在效率和准确性方面都优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Hermes框架通过更有效地利用行业相关性，显著提升了股票时间序列预测的性能，证明了考虑行业间领先滞后关系和多尺度信息建模的重要性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing
essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and
analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series
exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve
forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only
capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two
key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag
interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among
industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series
forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by
eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and
multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more
flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a
hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding
window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider
lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model
multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message
passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the
consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock
datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN方法忽略了邻居间的信息多样性，导致冗余信息聚合，且仅依赖单一时间尺度的表示进行预测

Method: 引入多样性感知邻居选择机制(DNSM)确保变量与邻居信息相似度高且邻居间保持多样性，以及动态多尺度融合模块(DMFM)动态调整不同时间尺度预测结果的贡献

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明DIMIGNN持续优于先前方法

Conclusion: DIMIGNN通过处理邻居信息多样性和多尺度融合问题，显著提升了多元时间序列预测性能

Abstract: Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance
of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their
capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may
lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction
typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To
tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with
Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN).
DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to
ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its
neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore,
a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust
the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the
final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集模型的缩放定律不适用于MoE模型，因为MoE模型存在影响因素多重性、复杂耦合关系和非单调性能影响等挑战，需要专门研究MoE特定的缩放定律。

Method: 系统分解MoE设置，识别5个关键因素（数据大小D、总模型大小N、激活模型大小Na、激活专家数G、共享专家比例S），设计446个对照实验来表征边际效应，构建全面的联合MoE缩放定律。

Result: 发现G和S的最优设置与模型架构和数据大小无关；随着N的缩放，最优激活参数比例Na/N变得更稀疏；提出的MoE缩放定律能准确指导模型设计。

Conclusion: MoE缩放定律可作为准确且具有洞察力的指导，促进未来MoE模型的设计和训练，解决了现有缩放定律不适用的问题。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) has garnered increasing attention for its
ability to support distributed computation in environments with evolving data
distributions. However, the emergence of new tasks introduces both temporal and
cross-client shifts, making catastrophic forgetting a critical challenge. Most
existing works aggregate knowledge from clients into a global model, which may
not enhance client performance since irrelevant knowledge could introduce
interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. Additionally, directly
applying decentralized approaches to FCL suffers from ineffective group
formation caused by task changes. To address these challenges, we propose a
decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for FCL, where clients establish
dynamic cooperative learning coalitions to balance the acquisition of new
knowledge and the retention of prior learning, thereby obtaining personalized
models. To maximize model performance, each client engages in selective
cooperation, dynamically allying with others who offer meaningful performance
gains. This results in non-overlapping, variable coalitions at each stage of
the task. Moreover, we use coalitional affinity game to simulate coalition
relationships between clients. By assessing both client gradient coherence and
model similarity, we quantify the client benefits derived from cooperation. We
also propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution
algorithm to achieve cooperative and dynamic equilibrium. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to various
baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/ydn3229/DCFCL.

Result: 在LLaMA、Mistral和Pythia重排序器上的应用显示，该方法找到的联盟比聚类基线具有更高的一致性协同效应。

Conclusion: hedonic联盟揭示了超越解缠结的高阶结构，产生了功能重要、可解释且跨领域预测的计算单元。

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) encode rich task-specific features,
but the form of these representations, especially within MLP layers, remains
unclear. Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features
concentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures
meaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may
strengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how
neurons work together rather than in isolation.
  We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional
game theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences
capture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Using
top-responsive utilities and the PAC-Top-Cover algorithm, we extract stable
coalitions of neurons: groups whose joint ablation has non-additive effects. We
then track their transitions across layers as persistence, splitting, merging,
or disappearance.
  Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers fine-tuned on scalar IR
tasks, our method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than
clustering baselines. By revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features,
hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure beyond disentanglement and
yield computational units that are functionally important, interpretable, and
predictive across domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在联邦学习中集成领域对抗神经网络(DANN)的方法，通过近端正则化稳定客户端间的对抗训练，解决医学影像中的扫描仪引起的领域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中严格的隐私法规禁止原始数据共享，联邦学习(FL)成为自然选择。但扫描仪引起的领域偏移会导致模型在外部站点失效。现有协调方法需要跨站点直接比较数据，与FL隐私约束冲突；领域泛化(DG)虽提供隐私友好替代方案，但标准DG流程仍假设集中访问多站点数据，违反FL保证。

Method: 在FL过程中集成领域对抗神经网络(DANN)，当发现朴素联邦DANN无法收敛时，提出近端正则化方法来稳定客户端间的对抗训练。

Result: 在OpenBHB数据集的T1加权3D脑部MRI上进行实验，训练15个站点并在19个未见站点上测试，结果显示该方法在跨站点泛化方面优于FedAvg和ERM，同时保持数据隐私。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了FL中的领域偏移问题，实现了更好的跨站点泛化性能，同时严格遵守隐私约束。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains models locally at each research center or
clinic and aggregates only model updates, making it a natural fit for medical
imaging, where strict privacy laws forbid raw data sharing. A major obstacle is
scanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or
acquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most
harmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across
sites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG)
offers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations
without sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized
access to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets
these difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial
Neural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive
federated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method
that stabilizes adversarial training among clients. Experiments on T1-weighted
3-D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, performing brain-age prediction on
participants aged 6-64 y (mean 22+/-6 y; 45 percent male) in training and 6-79
y (mean 19+/-13 y; 55 percent male) in validation, show that training on 15
sites and testing on 19 unseen sites yields superior cross-site generalization
over FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.

Abstract: Model Merging (MM) has emerged as a promising alternative to multi-task
learning, where multiple fine-tuned models are combined, without access to
tasks' training data, into a single model that maintains performance across
tasks. Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks,
particularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored
its impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box
adversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully
mislead a target model.
  In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial
examples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis
consisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336
distinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion
of MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably
defend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success
rate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners
regarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM
methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating
representation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight
averaging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM
method to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this
increased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem. Our
findings offer critical insights for designing more secure systems employing
MM.

TL;DR: TimeTic是一个可迁移性估计框架，将模型选择重新定义为上下文学习问题，通过数据集元特征、模型特征和微调性能的表格结构，使用表格基础模型作为上下文学习器来预测TSFM在目标数据集上的微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）数量的增加，在有限公共数据的领域中，如何高效选择最适合下游微调的模型变得越来越具有挑战性。

Method: 将模型选择重新定义为上下文学习问题，利用数据集元特征、模型特征和微调性能构建表格结构，使用表格基础模型作为上下文学习器，并引入基于模型层熵演化的新型模型表征方法。

Result: 在包含10个数据集、10个基础模型和3个预测任务的基准测试中，TimeTic的估计与真实微调性能高度一致，平均秩相关约为0.6，比使用零样本性能作为可迁移性得分提高了30%。

Conclusion: TimeTic框架能够有效预测时间序列基础模型在未见数据集上的微调性能，为模型选择提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via
large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting
performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of
TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning
becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a
transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an
in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it
predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target)
dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as
contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time
scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset
meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ
tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce
a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers,
capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize
across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for
transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3
forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong
alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets,
achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement
compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的自适应频域网络SAFDNet，用于术中低血压的早期预警，通过整合频域特征和自适应阈值处理噪声，在真实世界数据集中取得了97.3%的AUROC性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术中低血压与术后并发症密切相关，现有AI预警模型在整合时频域信息、捕获长短期依赖关系和应对生物信号噪声方面存在局限，需要开发更有效的预测方法。

Method: SAFDNet包含自适应频谱块（利用傅里叶分析提取频域特征并采用自适应阈值降噪）和交互注意力块（捕获数据的长短期依赖关系）。

Result: 在两个大规模真实世界数据集上的内外验证显示，SAFDNet在IOH早期预警中达到97.3%的AUROC，优于现有最优模型，且表现出稳健的预测性能和低噪声敏感性。

Conclusion: SAFDNet通过有效整合时频域信息、处理噪声和捕获依赖关系，为术中低血压的临床预警提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly associated with postoperative
complications, including postoperative delirium and increased mortality, making
its early prediction crucial in perioperative care. While several artificial
intelligence-based models have been developed to provide IOH warnings, existing
methods face limitations in incorporating both time and frequency domain
information, capturing short- and long-term dependencies, and handling noise
sensitivity in biosignal data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network (SAFDNet). Specifically, SAFDNet
integrates an adaptive spectral block, which leverages Fourier analysis to
extract frequency-domain features and employs self-adaptive thresholding to
mitigate noise. Additionally, an interactive attention block is introduced to
capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Extensive
internal and external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets
demonstrate that SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3\% AUROC in IOH early warning,
outperforming state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SAFDNet exhibits robust
predictive performance and low sensitivity to noise, making it well-suited for
practical clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大规模数据集聚类任务的计算效率问题，需要开发能够有效捕捉数据底层结构的高效算法。

Method: 使用粒球技术进行多采样，构建多粒度粒球来逐步揭示数据的统计"骨架"，即近似原始数据本质结构和分布的空间抽象。

Result: 在标准计算硬件上的大量实验表明，GBSK在大规模数据集上实现了高效率和强聚类性能，包括处理高达1亿个实例、256维的数据集。

Conclusion: GBSK及其自适应版本AGBSK能够有效处理大规模聚类任务，在保持高精度的同时显著提升计算效率，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a
novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the
granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By
multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK
progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that
approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data.
This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while
maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive
version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and
facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted
on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency
and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with
up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and
experimental results are available at: https://github.com/XFastDataLab/GBSK/.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种延迟调度机制(DP)来解决符号音乐生成中效率与质量之间的权衡问题，该机制能够在不增加参数的情况下改善复合标记的性能，缩小与细粒度标记的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号音乐生成面临效率与质量的基本权衡：细粒度标记化能实现强连贯性但序列长、复杂度高，而紧凑标记化提高了效率但牺牲了标记内依赖关系。

Method: 采用基于延迟的调度机制(DP)，将复合类标记扩展到多个解码步骤中，使自回归模型能够建模标记内依赖关系，同时保持效率。该方法轻量级，不引入额外参数，可无缝集成到现有表示中。

Result: 在符号管弦乐MIDI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有指标上都优于标准复合标记化，并缩小了与细粒度标记化的差距。

Conclusion: 延迟调度机制(DP)是一种有效的解决方案，能够在保持效率的同时改善符号音乐生成的质量，特别是在处理标记内依赖关系方面表现出色。

Abstract: Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency
and quality. Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long
sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency
at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a
delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across
decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies
while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that
introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show
that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and
narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.

TL;DR: 本文提出模式感知批量归一化(MA-BN)方法，解决了批量归一化在深度强化学习中因数据非独立同分布和动态分布变化导致的训练不稳定问题，显著提升了训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批量归一化在深度学习中有重要作用，但由于深度强化学习中数据的非独立同分布特性和动态分布变化，其应用受到限制。本文旨在探索如何有效利用批量归一化在深度强化学习中的优势。

Method: 对离线策略演员-评论家算法中批量归一化的使用进行实证研究，分析不同训练和评估模式对性能的影响，识别导致不稳定的故障模式，并提出模式感知批量归一化(MA-BN)方法。

Result: MA-BN方法在强化学习环境中能够加速和稳定训练，扩大有效学习率范围，增强探索能力，并降低整体优化难度。

Conclusion: 通过适当的应用方式，批量归一化可以适应动态数据分布，在深度强化学习中提升收敛速度和最终性能，MA-BN方法为此提供了实用的集成建议。

Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN) has played a pivotal role in the success of deep
learning by improving training stability, mitigating overfitting, and enabling
more effective optimization. However, its adoption in deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data
and the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning
process. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains
unique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and
its ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to
evolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final
performance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use
of BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how
different training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify
failure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying
causes, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with
practical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL
pipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates
and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances
exploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT)方法，通过KL正则化增强Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT)，在保持理论紧致性的同时解决训练不稳定性问题，在数学推理、医学知识基础和代码生成等任务上优于SFT和DFT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型后训练中监督微调(SFT)容易过拟合而强化学习(RL)计算成本高的问题，DFT作为折中方案在某些任务中表现不稳定，需要改进。

Method: 通过奖励加权回归(RWR)框架分析DFT，发现其缺乏分布锚定导致训练漂移，提出ASFT方法在DFT重加权基础上增加轻量级KL正则化。

Result: ASFT在数学推理、医学知识基础和代码生成任务上一致优于SFT和DFT，取得显著改进且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: RWR框架为理解后训练方法提供了系统视角，表明原则性理论分析既能提供更强保证又能带来实际收益。

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off
between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations
but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可解释风险评分方法依赖手动预处理、任务特定建模和简化假设，限制了其灵活性和预测能力。

Method: SHAPoint框架集成梯度提升树的预测准确性和基于点的风险评分的可解释性，支持分类、回归和生存任务，继承树模型的优势如缺失数据处理和单调约束支持。

Result: 实证结果显示SHAPoint产生紧凑可解释的评分，预测性能与最先进方法相当，但运行时间显著减少。

Conclusion: SHAPoint是透明和可扩展风险分层的强大工具，提供卓越的灵活性、减少手动预处理依赖和更快的运行时性能。

Abstract: Interpretable risk scores play a vital role in clinical decision support, yet
traditional methods for deriving such scores often rely on manual
preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and simplified assumptions that limit
their flexibility and predictive power. We present SHAPoint, a novel,
task-agnostic framework that integrates the predictive accuracy of gradient
boosted trees with the interpretability of point-based risk scores. SHAPoint
supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting
valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing
data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks,
SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing,
and faster runtime performance. Empirical results show that SHAPoint produces
compact and interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, but at a fraction of the runtime, making it a
powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification.

Motivation: 受认知神经科学中语义聚类和启动效应的启发，探索LLMs中类似的知识同质性模式，即相关实体在知识掌握程度上具有相似性。

Method: 将LLM知识映射为图表示，通过图神经网络回归模型预测实体级知识性得分，优先检查知识掌握较差的实体三元组。

Result: 发现LLMs在图中位置相近的实体上具有相似的知识掌握水平，提出的方法能有效提高知识覆盖率和多跳路径检索效率。

Conclusion: 知识同质性原则可用于优化LLMs的知识注入和推理任务，在相同标注预算下最大化知识覆盖率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural
knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as
question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of
their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience
findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact
increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an
analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM
knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

Motivation: Mamba作为Transformer的高效替代模型，在长序列建模中表现出色，但其上下文学习的理论机制尚不明确，限制了对其底层机制的理解。

Method: 通过开发针对Mamba结构的非凸优化新技术，分析其在线性回归ICL任务中的训练动态，建立指数收敛率和损失边界。

Result: 证明了Mamba能够以指数收敛率达到ICL解，损失边界与Transformer相当，并揭示其通过在线梯度下降机制学习潜在函数。

Conclusion: Mamba通过不同于Transformer的在线梯度下降机制实现上下文学习，理论结果得到实验验证，为理解Mamba的ICL能力提供了理论基础。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, emerge as an efficient
Transformer alternative with linear complexity for long-sequence modeling.
Recent empirical works demonstrate Mamba's in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities competitive with Transformers, a critical capacity for large
foundation models. However, theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL remains
limited, restricting deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms. Even
fundamental tasks such as linear regression ICL, widely studied as a standard
theoretical benchmark for Transformers, have not been thoroughly analyzed in
the context of Mamba. To address this gap, we study the training dynamics of
Mamba on the linear regression ICL task. By developing novel techniques
tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's
structure, we establish an exponential convergence rate to ICL solution, and
derive a loss bound that is comparable to Transformer's. Importantly, our
results reveal that Mamba can perform a variant of \textit{online gradient
descent} to learn the latent function in context. This mechanism is different
from that of Transformer, which is typically understood to achieve ICL through
gradient descent emulation. The theoretical results are verified by
experimental simulation.

Motivation: Visual CoT通过整合视觉编辑显著提升了多模态推理性能，但其在图像级噪声下的鲁棒性尚未被探索。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 构建包含12种图像损坏类型和4个VQA数据集的基准测试，系统比较使用Visual CoT和未使用Visual CoT的VLMs。通过分析识别脆弱性来源，并提出集成Grounding DINO的即插即用增强方法。

Result: Visual CoT在干净和噪声图像上都能提升绝对准确率，但对输入扰动更敏感，性能下降更显著。编辑图像块被识别为脆弱性的主要来源。

Conclusion: 揭示了Visual CoT的明显脆弱性模式，并提供了有效的架构无关解决方案来增强视觉鲁棒性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced reasoning in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extending this paradigm, Visual CoT integrates
explicit visual edits, such as cropping or annotating regions of interest, into
the reasoning process, achieving superior multimodal performance. However, the
robustness of Visual CoT-based VLMs against image-level noise remains
unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of Visual
CoT robustness under visual perturbations. Our benchmark spans 12 image
corruption types across 4 Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, enabling a
comprehensive comparison between VLMs that use Visual CoT, and VLMs that do
not. The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves
absolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted
by noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations,
resulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through
extensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual
CoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility.
Building on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement
method that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline,
providing high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning. Our work
reveals clear fragility patterns in Visual CoT and offers an effective,
architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing visual robustness.

Motivation: 现有引导方法依赖大规模数据集学习清晰的行为信息，限制了在实际场景中的应用。从小数据集提取的引导向量常包含任务无关的噪声特征，影响其有效性

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器对引导向量进行语义去噪和增强：首先根据SAE提供的语义移除任务无关特征，然后通过语义相似性丰富小数据集中缺失的任务相关特征

Result: 大量实验表明SAE-RSV显著优于包括监督微调在内的所有基线方法

Conclusion: 通过SAE精炼原始引导向量，可以从有限训练数据中构建有效的引导向量

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language
models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing
steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral
information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The
steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant
noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering
vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector
via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise
and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove
task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and
then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their
semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the
baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that
effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by
refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

Conclusion: STAIR有效缓解了多阶段任务中的阶段错位问题，提升了偏好强化学习的性能，且学习到的阶段与人类认知相符。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward
engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling
better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in
multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g.,
navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments
from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in
uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we
validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and
empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward
learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal
distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance
is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into
coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to
policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in
multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks.
Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are
consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating
stage misalignment.

Conclusion: 智能代理驱动的联邦学习系统能够显著减少医疗FL部署中的人工干预，但复杂协调任务仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare
sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment
is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial
human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),
(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data
pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across
clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and
cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook
these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks
motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent
agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively
manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this
end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases
of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a
benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to
autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL
algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and
cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of
complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6
modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,
Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic
performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,
and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3
can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more
complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for
even the strongest models.

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了强化学习中探索-利用权衡的传统观点，提出这种权衡可能是测量层面的假象。通过转向隐藏状态空间分析，发现探索和利用可以解耦，并开发了VERL方法来同时增强两者能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视RLVR领域中的探索-利用权衡观点，认为这种权衡可能不是基本约束，而是测量层面的产物。希望通过在语义丰富的隐藏状态空间进行分析，揭示探索和利用可以同时增强的可能性。

Method: 提出Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL)方法，通过有效秩(ER)及其导数ERV和ERA来量化探索和利用动态。利用理论上稳定的ERA作为预测元控制器，创建协同的双通道激励结构，直接塑造RL优势函数。

Result: 在多样化的LLM和推理基准测试中取得一致提升，在具有挑战性的Gaokao 2024数据集上实现了高达21.4%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: 探索和利用在隐藏状态层面可以解耦，这为同时增强两种能力提供了机会。VERL方法成功实现了探索-利用的协同增强，而非强制权衡。

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

TL;DR: Tequila是一种针对三元权重量化的优化方法，通过将死区陷阱权重重新用作动态偏置，解决了传统三元量化导致的精度下降问题，在保持高效推理的同时显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备部署大型语言模型需要量化技术，但现有方法依赖缺乏高效硬件支持的混合精度乘法。三元权重量化虽然硬件友好，但会导致严重的精度损失，核心问题是死区陷阱现象。

Method: 提出Tequila方法，将死区陷阱权重重新用作动态偏置，使这些权重在前向传播中提供连续信号，在反向传播中接收有意义的梯度信号，从而增强模型容量和优化能力，且几乎不增加推理开销。

Result: 在五个基准测试中优于最先进的三元量化方法，在ARC基准上比SOTA基线提升>4%准确率，接近全精度性能（差距<1%），推理速度提升3.0倍。

Conclusion: Tequila为资源受限环境中部署先进LLMs提供了高度实用和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on
mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it
not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining
weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with
hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to
significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training
with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large
number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because
these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable
escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.
To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization
optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing
them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a
continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct,
meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model
capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC
benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly
matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference
speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient
implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained
environments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

*Beiliang Wu,Peiyuan Liu,Yifan Hu,Luyan Zhang,Ao Hu,Zenglin Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了IndexNet，一种基于MLP的多变量时间序列预测框架，通过索引嵌入模块利用时间戳和变量索引的上下文语义信息，提升长期复杂周期模式捕获能力并避免变量同质化预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多忽略了时间戳和变量索引等描述性信息，这些信息携带丰富的上下文语义，能够提升多变量时间序列预测的性能。

Method: IndexNet框架包含索引嵌入模块，由时间戳嵌入和通道嵌入组成。时间戳嵌入将时间戳转换为嵌入向量注入输入序列，通道嵌入为每个变量分配可训练的身份嵌入，使模型能够区分异质变量。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，IndexNet在主流基线方法中达到可比性能，验证了时间感知和变量感知设计的有效性。

Conclusion: IndexNet展示了强大的通用性和可解释性，这两个方面在当前多变量时间序列预测研究中仍未充分探索。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide
range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow
forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling
of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods
overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable
indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such
information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture
ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework
augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two
key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE).
Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them
into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture
long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a
unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model
to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized
predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable
performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our
temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and
visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality
and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF
research.

TL;DR: 提出了DyGEval方法，用于评估动态图神经网络在未见动态图上的性能表现，解决DGNN模型评估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于动态图数据分布随时间演变，训练好的DGNN模型在部署到未见测试图时面临性能不确定性，需要评估模型是否适合在特定测试图上进行推理。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）测试时动态图模拟，捕捉训练-测试分布差异作为监督信号；2）DyGEval开发与训练，准确估计训练好的DGNN模型在测试时动态图上的性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，DyGEval作为有效的评估器，能够在分布偏移下准确评估各种DGNN骨干网络在不同动态图上的性能。

Conclusion: DyGEval成功解决了动态图神经网络模型评估问题，为实际部署中评估DGNN模型在未见动态图上的性能提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for
learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world
systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph
data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant
performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in
practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed
DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is
suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we
introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess
the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by
estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time.
Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed
DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage
framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the
training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an
evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates
the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an
effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different
dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于空间群条件流匹配的晶体结构生成方法，通过约束原子在Wyckoff位置上的运动来生成更符合真实对称性的晶体结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在预测原子坐标时忽略了晶体对称性约束，导致生成的晶体对称性有限且不现实。需要开发能够严格遵循空间群对称性的生成方法。

Method: 通过条件对称噪声基分布和群条件等变向量场，将原子运动限制在其初始Wyckoff位置，使用高效的群平均方法实现对称化。

Result: 在晶体结构预测和从头生成基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，显著提高了生成晶体的对称性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效生成高度对称的稳定晶体结构，计算开销可忽略，为晶体材料设计提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Inorganic crystals are periodic, highly-symmetric arrangements of atoms in
three-dimensional space. Their structures are constrained by the symmetry
operations of a crystallographic \emph{space group} and restricted to lie in
specific affine subspaces known as \emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an
atom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its
Wyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates
overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high
populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce
Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that
samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric,
stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process
on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a
conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned,
equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to
their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is
achieved using an efficient reformulation of \emph{group averaging} tailored
for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of
symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on
crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. We also perform
relevant ablations.

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{E}$lectric $\textbf{C}$urrent $\textbf{D}$iscrete
$\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{G}$eneration (ECD$^{2}$G), a pioneering method for
data generation in discrete settings that is grounded in electrical engineering
theory. Our approach draws an analogy between electric current flow in a
circuit and the transfer of probability mass between data distributions. We
interpret samples from the source distribution as current input nodes of a
circuit and samples from the target distribution as current output nodes. A
neural network is then used to learn the electric currents to represent the
probability flow in the circuit. To map the source distribution to the target,
we sample from the source and transport these samples along the circuit
pathways according to the learned currents. This process provably guarantees
transfer between data distributions. We present proof-of-concept experiments to
illustrate our ECD$^{2}$G method.

Motivation: 强化学习中对建模错误和不确定性的鲁棒性仍然是一个核心挑战，需要开发能够应对环境动态不确定性的鲁棒策略。

Conclusion: 扩散模型通过条件采样生成最坏情况轨迹的方法能够有效提升强化学习策略的鲁棒性，为应对环境不确定性提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by
leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have
recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate
full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of
step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample
from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage
conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in
environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce
Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides
the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training,
effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results
across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and
performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

TL;DR: DART是一个解耦的GUI智能体强化学习训练框架，通过异步模块设计和自适应数据管理，显著提升了训练效率和性能，在OSWorld基准测试中达到42.13%的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉语言模型的GUI智能体在自动化桌面和移动任务方面具有潜力，但面临强化学习应用中的两个主要挑战：与GUI环境的多轮交互速度慢，以及智能体-环境交互质量不足。

Method: 提出DART框架，将训练系统分为四个异步模块：环境集群、回滚服务、数据管理器和训练器，实现非阻塞通信和异步训练。引入自适应数据管理方案，包括预收集成功轨迹、动态调整回滚参数、选择性训练高熵步骤和使用截断重要性采样。

Result: DART显著提升了系统效率：1.6倍GPU利用率、1.9倍训练吞吐量和5.5倍环境利用率。在OSWorld基准测试中，DART-GUI-7B达到42.13%的任务成功率，比基础模型提升14.61%，比开源SOTA高7.34%。

Conclusion: DART框架通过解耦设计和自适应数据管理有效解决了GUI智能体强化学习训练的效率和质量问题，为开源社区提供了有价值的贡献。

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating
complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying
reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI
environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality
agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these
challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI
agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.
DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment
cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables
non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory
sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the
system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,
and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from
abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)
pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement
sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers
and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on
high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning
via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout
and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task
success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than
open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and
model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe
is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

*Simon Schrodi,Elias Kempf,Fazl Barez,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 语言模型在蒸馏过程中可以传递隐藏偏见，这种现象称为潜意识学习。研究发现潜意识学习不需要全局token纠缠或logit泄漏，而是由一小部分分歧token驱动，这些token在不同偏见的教师模型下会产生不同的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型蒸馏过程中隐藏偏见传递的机制，特别是理解在硬蒸馏（学生模型只看到采样token）情况下潜意识学习如何发生。

Method: 通过受控实验和机制分析，识别分歧token的作用，并通过掩码这些token来验证其重要性。还研究了不同层对潜意识学习的影响。

Result: 发现分歧token是潜意识学习的关键，掩码这些token可以基本消除隐藏偏见传递。早期层对潜意识学习至关重要，甚至微调单个早期层就足以实现潜意识学习。潜意识学习很脆弱，即使是小的提示改写也能抑制它。

Conclusion: 潜意识学习主要由分歧token驱动，早期层在其中起关键作用，但这种学习机制很脆弱，容易被干扰破坏。

Abstract: Language models can transfer hidden biases during distillation. For example,
a teacher that "likes owls" can make its student "like owls" too, even when the
training data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is
called subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft
distillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token
distribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where
the student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how
does subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through
controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that
subliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.
Instead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where
teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out
these tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically,
divergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly,
finetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal
learning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small
changes, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.

Motivation: 现代深度学习理论面临的关键挑战是解释基于梯度的优化方法在训练大规模复杂深度神经网络时的显著成功。虽然已有研究证明了特定架构的线性收敛性，但统一的理论仍然缺乏。

Method: 提出了一个统一的理论证明，适用于任何具有分段非零多项式激活函数或ReLU、sigmoid激活函数的神经网络，在连续梯度下降（梯度流）框架下进行分析。

Result: 建立了一个通用的定理，不仅覆盖了先前未知的架构，还在更弱的假设下整合了现有结果。理论预测与实用步长梯度下降方法的经验结果高度一致。

Conclusion: 该研究为深度神经网络训练中的梯度优化方法提供了一个统一的收敛性理论框架，填补了理论空白，并为理解深度学习优化过程提供了重要洞见。

Abstract: A key challenge in modern deep learning theory is to explain the remarkable
success of gradient-based optimization methods when training large-scale,
complex deep neural networks. Though linear convergence of such methods has
been proved for a handful of specific architectures, a united theory still
evades researchers. This article presents a unified proof for linear
convergence of continuous gradient descent, also called gradient flow, while
training any neural network with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or
ReLU, sigmoid activations. Our primary contribution is a single, general
theorem that not only covers architectures for which this result was previously
unknown but also consolidates existing results under weaker assumptions. While
our focus is theoretical and our results are only exact in the infinitesimal
step size limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the
predictions of our result and those of the practical step-size gradient descent
method.

Motivation: 现有基于正则化的方法在长期LLM持续学习中失败，主要原因是微调过程中功能方向的漂移。

Method: DOC方法追踪功能方向的漂移并在微调过程中动态更新，同时调整新任务参数的梯度使其与历史功能方向正交。

Result: 在多个LLM持续学习基准测试中，该方法优于现有方法，有效减少了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: DOC方法为持续LLM微调提供了一个强大的工具，能够有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Motivation: 为了解决从稀疏时间序列数据中学习时，如何在保持模型可解释性的同时不牺牲性能的问题。现有的黑盒模型虽然性能好但缺乏可解释性，而简单模型又无法处理复杂的时间序列模式。

Method: 将每个时间相关轨迹表示为有向图，应用增强的图神经加法网络(GNAN)。通过特征分组和图分组来编码先验知识，允许用户控制可解释性与表达力之间的权衡。

Result: 在真实世界数据集（包括基于血液检测的死亡率预测和假新闻检测）上，GMAN超越了强大的非可解释黑盒基线模型，同时提供了可操作且与领域对齐的解释。

Conclusion: GMAN框架成功地在保持模型可解释性的同时实现了高性能，为稀疏时间序列数据分析提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够提供多层次（特征、节点、图）的可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce GMAN, a flexible, interpretable, and expressive framework that
extends Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNANs) to learn from sets of sparse

users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping
features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and
graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality
prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong
non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiViS是一种用于视觉语言模型推测解码的显式-隐式输入分解框架，通过从草稿器中移除视觉标记，仅保留文本标记作为显式输入，同时重用目标VLM的隐藏状态作为隐式视觉信息，显著加速推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码在加速大型语言模型推理方面很有效，但应用于视觉语言模型时面临挑战：1）草稿器和目标VLM可能来自不同模型家族，视觉标记的语义表示不对齐，在预填充阶段引入KV缓存偏差；2）大量视觉标记显著减慢草稿器在解码阶段的自注意力计算。

Method: 提出HiViS框架：1）从草稿器输入中移除所有视觉标记，仅保留文本标记作为显式输入；2）直接重用目标VLM对应的最后一层隐藏状态作为隐式视觉信息；3）采用多步自反馈训练策略，包含动态数据选择和序列嵌入监督来模拟推理过程。

Result: 将草稿器的预填充序列长度压缩到目标VLM输入的仅0.7%-1.3%，同时保持无损生成质量。在多样化模型和任务上的实验显示最高可达2.65倍加速。

Conclusion: HiViS通过显式-隐式输入分解有效解决了VLM中推测解码的视觉标记挑战，在保持生成质量的同时显著加速推理速度，证实了该方法在加速VLM推理方面的有效性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective approach for accelerating inference in
Large Language models (LLMs), but its adaptation to Vision-Language models
(VLMs) remains challenging for additional visual tokens in multimodal inputs.
First, owing to the fact that the drafter and the target VLM may derived from
different families, the semantic representations of visual tokens in the target
VLM are misaligned with those in the drafter, introducing bias into the
KV-cache during the prefill stage. Second, the large number of visual tokens
substantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding
stage. We propose Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative
Decoding in Vision-Language Models (HiViS), an explicit-implicit input
decomposition framework that alleviates the above inefficiency. All visual
tokens are removed from the drafter's input, retaining only textual tokens as
explicit inputs, while directly reusing the target VLM's corresponding
last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information without additional
processing. To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step
self-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential
embedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training. Our approach
compresses the prefill sequence length of the drafter to only 0.7%-1.3% of the
target VLM's input, while maintaining lossless generation quality. Extensive
experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate up to 2.65x speedup,
confirming the effectiveness of HiViS in accelerating VLM inference.

Result: 发现神经元利用率随模型进化降低反映更强泛化能力；训练动态轨迹中基准性能信号有限而MUI提供更深层洞察；任务完成来自多个专家协作贡献；神经元激活模式可作为数据多样性的细粒度代理。

Conclusion: MUI可作为基准性能的补充指标，为MoE模型的容量、动态和专业化提供新见解。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

Motivation: 探索扩散模型与凯利准则在赌博游戏中的联系，理解条件扩散模型如何存储和利用信号与条件信息之间的互信息，特别是在图像生成任务中。

Method: 通过理论分析建立扩散模型与凯利准则的数学联系，研究条件扩散模型中互信息的存储机制，分析分类器无关指导对互信息提升的作用。

Result: 发现条件扩散模型存储的额外信息等于信号X与条件信息Y之间的互信息，分类器无关指导能有效提升采样时的互信息，这对图像模型特别有帮助。

Conclusion: 扩散模型与凯利准则存在深刻联系，条件扩散模型通过存储互信息实现条件生成，分类器无关指导是提升条件生成质量的有效机制，同时澄清了扩散模型作为无限深度自编码器的某些误解。

Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for
maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models
store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning
information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free
guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at
sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual
information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately
connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the
popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In
doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum
mechanics.

TL;DR: CorText框架将神经活动直接集成到LLM的潜在空间中，实现了与脑数据的开放式自然语言交互，能够生成准确的图像描述并回答详细问题，展示了从被动解码向生成性、灵活脑语言接口的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经解码方法局限于静态、非交互的方式，无法实现与脑数据的自然语言交互。本文旨在开发一个能够将神经活动直接融入LLM潜在空间的框架，实现开放式的脑数据交互。

Method: 提出CorText框架，在观看自然场景时记录的fMRI数据上进行训练，将神经活动直接集成到大型语言模型的潜在空间中。

Result: CorText能够生成准确的图像描述，在仅访问神经数据的情况下比对照组更好地回答详细问题，并展示了零样本泛化能力，超越了训练期间看到的语义类别。

Conclusion: CorText标志着从被动神经解码向生成性、灵活脑语言接口的重要转变，通过反事实分析模拟了皮层微刺激，为脑机交互开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-machine interaction,
and have been extended by embedding diverse modalities such as images into a
shared language space. Yet, neural decoding has remained constrained by static,
non-interactive methods. We introduce CorText, a framework that integrates
neural activity directly into the latent space of an LLM, enabling open-ended,
natural language interaction with brain data. Trained on fMRI data recorded
during viewing of natural scenes, CorText generates accurate image captions and
can answer more detailed questions better than controls, while having access to
neural data only. We showcase that CorText achieves zero-shot generalization
beyond semantic categories seen during training. Furthermore, we present a
counterfactual analysis that emulates in-silico cortical microstimulation.
These advances mark a shift from passive decoding toward generative, flexible
interfaces between brain activity and language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Shapely 2.0和Triton等工具提高了空间相似度计算的效率，但对于极大数据集，计算量仍然巨大，需要减少验证的聚类数量来降低计算负载。

Method: 集成动态相似度索引阈值、监督调度和召回约束优化，利用核密度估计动态确定相似度阈值，使用机器学习模型优先处理聚类。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法具有可扩展性和有效性，在不牺牲准确性的情况下显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模地理空间分析提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够有效处理极大数据集的空间相似度计算问题。

Abstract: Advancements in tools like Shapely 2.0 and Triton can significantly improve
the efficiency of spatial similarity computations by enabling faster and more
scalable geometric operations. However, for extremely large datasets, these
optimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations
required. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of
clusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on
these systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding,
supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently
identify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting
user-defined precision and recall requirements. By leveraging Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine
learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial
reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental
results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a
practical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DiBS-MTL，一种基于方向性协商解决方案的多任务学习方法，能够抵抗任务损失的非仿射单调变换，避免任务主导问题，并在非凸设置下收敛到帕累托稳定点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多任务学习方法通过加权平均组合任务损失或梯度，但任务损失的非仿射缩放会导致某些任务主导训练，降低整体性能。需要一种对单调非仿射变换不变的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 基于合作协商理论中的方向性协商解决方案(DiBS)，开发了DiBS-MTL算法。该方法在非凸多任务学习设置下保证收敛到帕累托稳定点，且对任务损失的单调非仿射变换具有不变性。

Result: 在标准多任务学习基准测试中，DiBS-MTL与最先进方法性能相当，同时在面对显著降低现有方法性能的非仿射单调变换时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DiBS-MTL提供了一种有效的多任务学习方法，能够避免任务主导问题，对任务损失缩放具有鲁棒性，并在非凸设置下保证收敛性。

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) algorithms typically rely on schemes that combine
different task losses or their gradients through weighted averaging. These
methods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require
access to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central
challenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled
relative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade
overall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the
Direction-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS), yields Pareto stationary solutions
immune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task
loss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of DiBS in nonconvex
MTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under
standard assumptions, a subsequence of DiBS iterates converges to a Pareto
stationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose DiBS-MTL,
a computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS to the MTL setting. Finally, we
validate DiBS-MTL empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it
achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that
significantly degrade the performance of existing approaches, including prior
bargaining-inspired MTL methods. Code available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文验证了Chinchilla缩放定律的可靠性，发现尽管存在参数定义模糊等问题，但其核心结果（缩放定律估计和计算最优的token-参数比）具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对Chinchilla缩放定律存在的置信区间宽、方法不一致等问题，验证其是否仍可作为语言模型缩放的可信指南。

Method: 通过分析参数定义的三种可能解释，并系统性地扰动模型参数来测试关键结果的敏感性。

Result: 发现参数定义的选择不影响核心结果，且Chinchilla的关键结果能够承受相当大的参数扰动，特别是对加性或系统性误差最敏感。

Conclusion: Chinchilla的缩放定律仍然是语言模型缩放的可信指南，为领域提供了新的信心。

Abstract: Hoffman et al (2022)'s Chinchilla paper introduced the principle of
compute-optimal scaling, laying a foundation for future scaling of language
models. In the years since, however, valid concerns about Chinchilla have been
raised: wide confidence intervals, discrepancies between its three approaches,
and incongruities with other scaling laws. This raises a critical question for
the field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work
demonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model
parameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three
interpretations are possible, with relative differences between different
interpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps
surprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not
meaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the
compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Indeed, under one interpretation,
the tokens-to-parameter ratio becomes more constant with the target compute
budget. We then ask how distorted the Chinchilla model parameters could have
been without meaningfully affecting the key results. By deliberately perturbing
model parameters in four structured ways, we find that key Chinchilla results
are most sensitive to additive or systematic errors, which can alter the
otherwise flat trend of the optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio, but overall,
Chinchilla's key results withstand sizable perturbations. Altogether, our
findings offer the field renewed confidence in Chinchilla as a durable guide
for scaling language models.

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

Motivation: 金融衍生品智能合约自动化虽能带来效率提升，但将金融规范转换为gas高效的可执行代码仍面临挑战，特别是从高级规范生成既功能正确又经济可行的代码

Method: 使用PPO强化学习代理从预定义库中选择最优代码片段，采用两阶段课程学习：先训练功能正确性，再转向gas优化

Conclusion: 该工作为自动合成可靠且经济可持续的智能合约提供了可行方法，弥合了高级金融协议与高效链上执行之间的差距

Abstract: Smart contract-based automation of financial derivatives offers substantial
efficiency gains, but its real-world adoption is constrained by the complexity
of translating financial specifications into gas-efficient executable code. In
particular, generating code that is both functionally correct and economically
viable from high-level specifications, such as the Common Domain Model (CDM),
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart
contracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a
pre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum
first trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to
gas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate
contracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to
35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines. This work
presents a viable methodology for the automated synthesis of reliable and
economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging the gap between high-level
financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法如PC、GES和ICA-LiNGAM在可扩展性（超过70个节点）、计算能耗和混合数据类型处理方面存在严重限制，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: GUIDE框架集成LLM生成的邻接矩阵与观测数据，采用双编码器架构，通过强化学习代理动态平衡奖励最大化（准确性）和惩罚避免（DAG约束）。

Result: GUIDE平均减少约42%的运行时间（相比RL-BIC和KCRL），在准确性上相比NOTEARS和GraN-DAG平均提升约117%，并能扩展到≥70个节点。

Conclusion: GUIDE在计算效率、准确性和可扩展性方面显著优于现有方法，特别是在高维和混合数据类型场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Modern causal discovery methods face critical limitations in scalability,
computational efficiency, and adaptability to mixed data types, as evidenced by
benchmarks on node scalability (30, $\le 50$, $\ge 70$ nodes), computational
energy demands, and continuous/non-continuous data handling. While traditional
algorithms like PC, GES, and ICA-LiNGAM struggle with these challenges,
exhibiting prohibitive energy costs for higher-order nodes and poor scalability
beyond 70 nodes, we propose \textbf{GUIDE}, a framework that integrates Large
Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data
through a dual-encoder architecture. GUIDE uniquely optimizes computational
efficiency, reducing runtime on average by $\approx 42%$ compared to RL-BIC and
KCRL methods, while achieving an average $\approx 117%$ improvement in accuracy
over both NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually. During training, GUIDE's
reinforcement learning agent dynamically balances reward maximization
(accuracy) and penalty avoidance (DAG constraints), enabling robust performance
across mixed data types and scalability to $\ge 70$ nodes -- a setting where
baseline methods fail.

TL;DR: 提出SLA（稀疏线性注意力）方法，通过将注意力权重分为关键、边缘和可忽略三类，分别应用O(N²)、O(N)计算和跳过处理，实现DiT模型20倍的注意力计算减少，在保持生成质量的同时显著加速视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiT）模型中，由于长序列长度和二次复杂度，注意力延迟是主要瓶颈。研究发现注意力权重可分为高秩大权重和低秩剩余权重两部分。

Method: SLA将注意力权重分为关键、边缘和可忽略三类：对关键权重应用O(N²)注意力计算，对边缘权重应用O(N)线性注意力，跳过可忽略权重。所有计算集成到单个GPU内核中，支持前向和后向传播。

Result: SLA将注意力计算减少95%，在Wan2.1-1.3B上实现注意力计算13.7倍加速和端到端视频生成2.2倍加速，且不降低生成质量。

Conclusion: SLA通过融合稀疏和线性注意力，有效加速扩散模型，在保持生成质量的同时显著减少计算开销，优于基线方法。

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation,
attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the
quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two
parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining
weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse
acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based
on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable
attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion
models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and
negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)
attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these
computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward
passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x
reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration
without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention
computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,
outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU
kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a
2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

Motivation: 虽然已有大量研究关注拟合缩放定律和预测预训练损失及判别式评估的性能，但对生成式评估（如数学问题解决或软件工程）的缩放定律研究相对较少。

Result: 研究发现：计算缩放定律和参数+token缩放定律在最后约1.5-2.5个数量级稳定，黄金参考似然缩放定律在最后约5个数量级稳定。三种缩放定律预测性能相当，但计算缩放定律在小k时预测稍差，黄金参考似然缩放定律在大k时预测稍差。

Conclusion: 建立了计算缩放定律作为参数和token缩放定律的计算最优包络的理论联系，为研究人员和从业者提供了预测生成性能的见解和方法论。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have played a central role in modern machine learning,
driving the field's ever-expanding scaling of parameters, data and compute.
While much research has gone into fitting scaling laws and predicting
performance on pretraining losses and on discriminative evaluations such as
multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has been done
on fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on generative evaluations
such as mathematical problem-solving or software engineering. We propose and
evaluate three different pretraining scaling laws for fitting pass-at-$k$ on
generative evaluations and for predicting pass-at-$k$ of the most expensive
model using the performance of cheaper models. Our three scaling laws differ in
the covariates used: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log
likelihoods of gold reference solutions. We make four main contributions: (1)
We show how generative evaluations offer new hyperparameters (in our setting,
$k$) that researchers can use to control the scaling laws parameters and the
predictability of performance. (2) In terms of scaling law parameters, we find
that the compute scaling law and parameters\,+\,tokens scaling law stabilize
for the last ~$1.5{-}2.5$ orders of magnitude, whereas the gold reference
likelihood scaling law stabilizes for the last ~$5$ orders of magnitude. (3) In
terms of predictive performance, we find all three scaling laws perform
comparably, although the compute scaling law predicts slightly worse for small
$k$ and the log likelihoods of gold reference solutions predicts slightly worse
for large $k$. (4) We establish a theoretical connection that the compute
scaling law emerges as the compute-optimal envelope of the
parameters-and-tokens scaling law. Our framework provides researchers and
practitioners with insights and methodologies to forecast generative
performance.

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video
understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory
modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a
foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of
normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories
into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary
modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent
transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised
masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across
modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual
labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and
Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as
trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most
pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual
reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation
model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class
modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further
reference.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过让设备端LLM自主决策路由，有效解决了设备-云协作中的路由问题，实现了更好的性能平衡。

Abstract: Device-cloud collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for deploying
large language models (LLMs), combining the efficiency of lightweight on-device
inference with the superior performance of powerful cloud LLMs. An essential
problem in this scenario lies in deciding whether a given query is best handled
locally or delegated to the cloud. Existing approaches typically rely on
external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to
determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing
decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled
through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization
problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem
solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we
develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level
policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the
reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on
cloud LLM usage. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that
the proposed methodology consistently outperforms existing baselines and
significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance.

Conclusion: ICQL展示了上下文学习在鲁棒和组合价值估计中的潜力，为离线强化学习提供了原则性且有效的框架。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline
reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single
global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks
involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning
(\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a
contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer
local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels.
Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of
the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved
context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and
supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL}
substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance
in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\%
and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context
learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning
\texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Strategy Choice Theory (SCT)\footnote{``Strategy Choice Theory'',
``Distributions of Associations'', and ``Overlapping Wave Theory'' have been
used to refer to this line of work, emphasizing different
aspects.}\citep[e.g.,][]{siegler1984strategychoices, siegler2000rebirth}
explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon
principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data,
probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like
importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast
SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based
architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting
practice\footnote{The original SCT model was pre-biased in accordance with the
supposed experience of counting.}, symbol (number) embedding, and gated
attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and
destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like''
use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to
later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy
choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to
investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships
essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.

*Youssef Sabiri,Walid Houmaidi,Ouail El Maadi,Yousra Chtouki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AQUAIR是一个公开的水产养殖室内环境质量数据集，包含6个IEQ变量，在摩洛哥水产养殖设施中每5分钟采样一次，提供23,000多个时间戳观测数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏描述室内养殖池周围空气环境的公共数据集，限制了结合空气条件与水质动态的预测和异常检测工具的开发。

Method: 使用单个Awair HOME监测器在ISO标准安装高度下每5分钟采样，通过开源处理管道进行时间戳标准化、短间隙插值，并导出分析就绪表格。

Result: 探索性统计显示稳定条件（中值CO2=758 ppm；PM2.5=12微克/立方米），有明显的喂食时间峰值，为短期预测、事件检测和传感器漂移研究提供了丰富结构。

Conclusion: AQUAIR填补了智能水产养殖信息学的关键空白，为数据中心的机器学习课程和环境传感研究提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to
protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public
datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting
the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple
head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce
AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental
Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide,
total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture
facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every
five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000
time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly
archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting
height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source
processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and
exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions
(median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time
peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection,
and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture
informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine
learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space
dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Clebsch-Gordan Transformer，通过新颖的Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现高效全局注意力，解决等变transformer的计算效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统transformer的全局注意力机制计算成本高，而等变模型虽然在某些任务中精度更高，但计算需求大，现有等变transformer只能支持低阶等变特征和局部上下文窗口。

Method: 采用Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上进行高效全局注意力计算，实现O(N log N)复杂度，并通过利用Clebsch-Gordon矩阵的稀疏性来支持高阶不可约特征。

Result: 在n体模拟、QM9、ModelNet点云分类和机器人抓取数据集等多个基准测试中，在GPU内存大小、速度和准确性方面均优于现有等变transformer。

Conclusion: Clebsch-Gordan Transformer能够高效建模所有阶的等变特征，在保持等变性的同时显著提升了计算效率和性能。

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of
transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in
relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which
leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve
superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks,
at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing
equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local
context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work
proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a
novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our
method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving
${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method
scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of
the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token
permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We
benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body
simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping
dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU
memory size, speed, and accuracy.

### [223] [ADAPT: Lightweight, Long-Range Machine Learning Force Fields Without Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24115)
*Evan Dramko,Yihuang Xiong,Yizhi Zhu,Geoffroy Hautier,Thomas Reps,Christopher Jermaine,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAPT是一种基于Transformer的机器学习力场，通过直接坐标空间表示和显式考虑所有原子对相互作用，显著提升了点缺陷建模的准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统第一性原理方法计算点缺陷能级和结构成本高昂，而现有基于图神经网络的机器学习力场存在过平滑和长程相互作用表示不足的问题，特别是在点缺陷建模中尤为突出。

Method: 提出ADAPT模型，用直接坐标空间表示替代图表示，将原子视为token，使用Transformer编码器建模原子间相互作用，显式考虑所有原子对相互作用。

Result: 在硅点缺陷数据集上，ADAPT相比最先进的GNN模型，力和能量预测误差降低了约33%，同时计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: ADAPT通过创新的Transformer架构有效解决了点缺陷建模中的关键挑战，为加速材料缺陷研究提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials.
First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and
structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However,
these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force
fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural
relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range
interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling
point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep
Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph
representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly
considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a
Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of
silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both
force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based
model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.

### [224] [HyMaTE: A Hybrid Mamba and Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24118)
*Md Mozaharul Mottalib,Thao-Ly T. Phan,Rahmatollah Beheshti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出HyMaTE模型，结合状态空间模型和Transformer，用于电子健康记录的表示学习，解决长序列建模的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录数据具有长序列、多变量、稀疏性和缺失值等挑战，传统Transformer模型存在二次计算复杂度和上下文长度限制的问题。

Method: 开发HyMaTE混合模型，结合状态空间模型（如Mamba）的线性时间序列建模能力和注意力机制的优势，专门针对纵向数据表示学习。

Result: 在多个临床数据集上的预测任务测试表明，HyMaTE能够捕获更有效、更丰富、更细致的统一EHR数据表示。

Conclusion: HyMaTE作为一个可扩展和通用的解决方案，通过自注意力机制的可解释性结果，展示了其在现实世界医疗应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Electronic health Records (EHRs) have become a cornerstone in modern-day
healthcare. They are a crucial part for analyzing the progression of patient
health; however, their complexity, characterized by long, multivariate
sequences, sparsity, and missing values poses significant challenges in
traditional deep learning modeling. While Transformer-based models have
demonstrated success in modeling EHR data and predicting clinical outcomes,
their quadratic computational complexity and limited context length hinder
their efficiency and practical applications. On the other hand, State Space
Models (SSMs) like Mamba present a promising alternative offering linear-time
sequence modeling and improved efficiency for handling long sequences, but
focus mostly on mixing sequence-level information rather than channel-level
data. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyMaTE (A Hybrid Mamba and
Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning), a novel hybrid model
tailored for representing longitudinal data, combining the strengths of SSMs
with advanced attention mechanisms. By testing the model on predictive tasks on
multiple clinical datasets, we demonstrate HyMaTE's ability to capture an
effective, richer, and more nuanced unified representation of EHR data.
Additionally, the interpretability of the outcomes achieved by self-attention
illustrates the effectiveness of our model as a scalable and generalizable
solution for real-world healthcare applications. Codes are available at:

### [225] [Echo Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24122)
*Hongbo Liu,Jia Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Echo Flow Networks (EFNs)框架，通过扩展的Echo State Networks和MLP读出层，结合新颖的Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation机制，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列预测中长程依赖关系建模的挑战，传统方法在计算复杂性和信息保持能力之间存在权衡，而Echo State Networks虽然效率高但表达能力有限。

Method: 使用扩展的Echo State Networks (X-ESNs)与MLP读出层，引入Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation机制实现复杂的神经元特定时间动态，采用双流架构让近期输入历史从无限时域记忆中动态选择特征。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上评估，EFNs相比PatchTST等方法训练速度快4倍，模型大小小3倍，预测误差从43%降至35%，相对改进20%。EchoFormer在ETTh、ETTm、DMV、Weather和Air Quality数据集上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EFNs框架成功平衡了计算效率和表达能力，在时间序列预测任务中实现了显著的性能提升，为长序列建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge:
how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal
dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought
notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between
computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information
over extended horizons.
  Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have
recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant
memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This
makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event
history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art
performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both
their expressiveness and stability.
  We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of
extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel
Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex,
neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's
representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In
addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history
dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon
memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability.
  Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to
4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like
PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative
improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently
achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh,
ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.

### [226] [The Impossibility of Inverse Permutation Learning in Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24125)
*Rohan Alur,Chris Hays,Manish Raghavan,Devavrat Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this technical note, we study the problem of inverse permutation learning
in decoder-only transformers. Given a permutation and a string to which that
permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original
(``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness
property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval,
multiple choice QA and in-context learning. Our primary contribution is an
impossibility result: we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer
cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of
decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample
complexity. We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse
permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental
role of the causal attention mask, and reveals a gap between the expressivity
of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture.
The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply padding the input
with ``scratch tokens" yields a construction under which inverse permutation
learning is possible. We conjecture that this may suggest an alternative
mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate
``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models, even when
these tokens encode no meaningful semantic information (e.g., the results of
intermediate computations).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于机器学习的台风轨迹和状态预测方法，使用梯度提升回归和随机森林分类器，在台风状态分类上达到93%的准确率，为传统数值天气预报提供了有效的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报模型计算密集且容易因大气系统的混沌特性而产生误差，需要开发更高效准确的台风预测方法来减少生命损失、基础设施破坏和经济损失。

Method: 采用两阶段机器学习流程：首先使用滑动窗口历史数据通过回归模型预测台风特征（最大风速、最低气压、轨迹长度和方向变化），然后将这些输出输入分类模型预测台风分类状态。评估了梯度提升回归和三种分类器（随机森林、支持向量机、多层感知机）。

Result: 经过超参数调优和SMOTE处理后，随机森林分类器表现最佳，达到93%的准确率，在精确率、召回率和F1分数上均优于其他方法。回归结果误差较低，气压和风速预测误差分别为2.2mb和2.4kt。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型，特别是基于集成的分类器，为传统预报方法提供了有效、可扩展的替代方案，具有实时台风预测和集成到决策支持系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life,
infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather
prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to
error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a
machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and
status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including
recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a
regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum
pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of
historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to
predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and
three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and
multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and
synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest
performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision,
recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying
minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results
yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about
2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models,
especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative
to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone
prediction and integration into decision support systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种有界参数高效遗忘方法，通过在有界函数中应用MLP适配器来稳定LoRA微调，解决了梯度差异方法在LLM遗忘中的不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘方法不稳定且不可靠，特别是梯度差异方法在使用交叉熵损失时会导致权重和梯度无限增长，造成训练不稳定并影响遗忘和保留效果。

Method: 提出了有界参数高效遗忘方法，在LoRA微调中通过有界函数控制MLP适配器的权重动态，从而稳定梯度差异方法的优化过程。

Result: 在TOFU、TDEC和MUSE基准测试中，从125M到8B参数的不同架构和规模上，该方法在保持保留能力的同时显著改善了遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 建立了一个理论上有基础、实践上可扩展的LLM遗忘框架，通过有界参数高效方法实现了可靠的遗忘效果。

Abstract: Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy
and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A
widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent
on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data
whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy
loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading
to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide
a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how
ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP
layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient
Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based
fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple
modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient
difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE
benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our
method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving
retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable
framework for unlearning in LLMs.

*Qipeng Zhan,Zhuoping Zhou,Zexuan Wang,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出多尺度几何自编码器(MAE)，通过非对称架构同时保留数据的全局和局部几何结构，在编码器应用全局距离约束，在解码器应用局部几何约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自编码器方法通常单独关注全局或局部几何属性，全局方法存在距离近似误差累积问题，局部方法容易收敛到扭曲大规模关系的次优解。

Method: 采用非对称架构设计，在编码器施加全局距离约束，在解码器施加局部几何约束，同时保留多尺度几何结构。

Result: 在合成流形和真实数据集上的综合实验表明，MAE在各种评估指标上始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 非对称设计自然地与编码器和解码器的不同角色对齐，能够有效保持数据的多尺度几何结构。

Abstract: Autoencoders have emerged as powerful models for visualization and
dimensionality reduction based on the fundamental assumption that
high-dimensional data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold. A critical
challenge in autoencoder design is to preserve the geometric structure of data
in the latent space, with existing approaches typically focusing on either
global or local geometric properties separately. Global approaches often
encounter errors in distance approximation that accumulate, while local methods
frequently converge to suboptimal solutions that distort large-scale
relationships. We propose Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE), which
introduces an asymmetric architecture that simultaneously preserves both scales
of the geometric structure by applying global distance constraints to the
encoder and local geometric constraints to the decoder. Through theoretical
analysis, we establish that this asymmetric design aligns naturally with the
distinct roles of the encoder and decoder components. Our comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets demonstrate
that MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation
metrics.

*Ruibo Chen,Sheng Zhang,Yihan Wu,Tong Zheng,Peihua Mai,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出RSP框架，通过统计假设检验检测模型相关性，使用随机选择任务和p值量化证据，避免误报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型相似性检测方法需要访问参数或产生启发式分数，缺乏原则性阈值，限制了应用范围。

Method: RSP在参考模型上优化文本或视觉前缀用于随机选择任务，评估其到目标模型的可迁移性，产生严格的p值。

Result: 在LLM和VLM上的实验显示，RSP对相关模型产生小p值，对不相关模型保持高p值，具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RSP是首个原则性、通用的模型相关性检测统计框架，为现代机器学习生态系统提供透明可解释的决策。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs) has heightened the need for reliable techniques to determine
whether a model has been fine-tuned from or is even identical to another.
Existing similarity-based methods often require access to model parameters or
produce heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting their
applicability. We introduce Random Selection Probing (RSP), a
hypothesis-testing framework that formulates model correlation detection as a
statistical test. RSP optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model
for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target
model, producing rigorous p-values that quantify evidence of correlation. To
mitigate false positives, RSP incorporates an unrelated baseline model to
filter out generic, transferable features. We evaluate RSP across both LLMs and
VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference models and test models.
Experiments on fine-tuned and open-source models show that RSP consistently
yields small p-values for related models while maintaining high p-values for
unrelated ones. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness
of RSP. These results establish RSP as the first principled and general
statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and
interpretable decisions in modern machine learning ecosystems.

TL;DR: FM-FoG是一个基于基础模型的实时可穿戴系统，能够在无需患者特定训练的情况下检测新患者的冻结步态，通过自监督预训练和传感器上下文集成实现高精度检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冻结步态影响超过50%的中晚期帕金森病患者，显著损害患者行动独立性。现有检测系统需要大量患者特定训练数据且缺乏泛化能力，限制了临床应用。

Method: 结合自监督预训练和传感器上下文集成，使用轻量级CNN-LSTM活动分类器仅在行走或站立时激活基础模型，避免不必要的计算。

Result: 在23名PD患者的VCU FoG-IMU数据集上，FM-FoG在未见患者测试中达到98.5%的F1分数，显著优于基线方法。在Google Pixel 8a手机上部署可延长电池寿命达72%，同时保持低于20ms的干预延迟。

Conclusion: FM-FoG能够实现实用、节能的医疗应用，无需个体训练要求即可跨患者泛化。

Abstract: Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) affects over 50% of mid-to-late stage Parkinson's
disease (PD) patients, significantly impairing patients' mobility independence
and reducing quality of life. FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where
walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing
or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection
systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack
generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we
introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving
FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our
approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only
during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier
selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing,
avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23
PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen
patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on
a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72%
while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our
FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that
generalize across patients without individual training requirements.

*Linghao Kong,Angelina Ning,Micah Adler,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文发现语言模型中存在一类特殊的Wasserstein神经元，这些神经元虽然数量很少但至关重要，它们通过负预激活空间区分相似输入，对语法处理起到关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中特定神经元的功能，特别是那些在区分相似输入时起关键作用的神经元，以理解模型如何处理语法结构。

Method: 通过有针对性的神经元移除实验，分析Wasserstein神经元在负预激活空间中的功能，并使用符号特异性干预来验证这些神经元在语法处理中的作用。

Result: 移除Wasserstein神经元的负预激活会显著削弱模型功能并破坏语法行为，而随机控制实验则对语法性能影响很小。词性分析显示语法支架标记的意外性增加，层特异性干预表明局部退化会随深度累积。

Conclusion: Wasserstein神经元在负预激活空间中的分化机制是语言模型依赖语法处理的关键机制，这些神经元在训练过程中出现并稳定后对语法行为至关重要。

Abstract: A recently discovered class of entangled neurons, known as Wasserstein
neurons, is disproportionately critical in large language models despite
constituting only a very small fraction of the network: their targeted removal
collapses the model, consistent with their unique role in differentiating
similar inputs. Interestingly, in Wasserstein neurons immediately preceding
smooth activation functions, such differentiation manifests in the negative
pre-activation space, especially in early layers. Pairs of similar inputs are
driven to highly distinct negative values, and these pairs involve syntactic
tokens such as determiners and prepositions. We show that this negative region
is functional rather than simply favorable for optimization. A minimal,
sign-specific intervention that zeroes only the negative pre-activations of a
small subset of entangled neurons significantly weakens overall model function
and disrupts grammatical behavior, while both random and perplexity-matched
controls leave grammatical performance largely unchanged. Part of speech
analysis localizes the excess surprisal to syntactic scaffolding tokens, and
layer-specific interventions reveal that small local degradations accumulate
across depth. Over training checkpoints, the same ablation impairs grammatical
behavior as Wasserstein neurons emerge and stabilize. Together, these results
identify negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled neurons as a
crucial mechanism that language models rely on for syntax.

Conclusion: 研究为LLM的离策略RL提供了可操作的见解和新的算法设计机会，并通过实证研究验证了发现。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is
attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world
applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further
innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths
about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and
reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and
Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,
and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting
strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with
extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled
algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is

TL;DR: MDD-Thinker是一个基于大语言模型的抑郁症诊断框架，通过监督微调和强化学习增强推理能力，在UK Biobank数据集上训练，显著优于传统机器学习方法和通用大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重度抑郁症是全球主要致残原因，但当前诊断方法依赖主观评估且缺乏多模态临床信息整合能力。大语言模型有望提高诊断准确性，但面临可解释性、幻觉问题和依赖合成数据的挑战。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于大规模真实世界临床数据训练的推理增强大语言模型框架，用于抑郁症诊断。MDD-Thinker通过结合监督微调和强化学习，平衡了准确性、可解释性和效率，为智能精神科诊断提供了可扩展方法。推理导向的大语言模型可为抑郁症检测提供临床可靠支持，并可能应用于更广泛的心理健康护理领域。

Abstract: Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global
disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective
assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information.
Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy
through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability,
hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data.
  Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank
dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000
samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was
fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning
performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and
state-of-the-art LLM baselines.
  Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081,
significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well
as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest
improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and
34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance
compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency.
  Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework
for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By
integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric
diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide
clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader
applications in mental health care.

TL;DR: 提出了Conda优化器，结合了Adam的坐标自适应性和Muon的谱归一化优势，在LLaMA和GPT-2系列上实现了比AdamW快2-2.5倍的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Adam优化器存在谱条件差和低秩结构问题，而Muon虽然解决了谱条件问题但缺乏坐标自适应能力，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 将更新投影到正交子空间，基于投影梯度应用列级二阶矩归一化，同时改善谱条件并保持坐标自适应。

Result: 在LLaMA和GPT-2系列预训练中，Conda始终优于AdamW、Muon等基线方法，收敛速度达到AdamW的2-2.5倍。

Conclusion: Conda是一种有效且广泛适用的大规模LLM训练优化器，解决了Adam的谱病理问题同时保持快速收敛特性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and
emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive
and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast
convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal
that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank
structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral
normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Column-Normalized Adam (Conda)}, a novel optimizer that bridges
the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal
subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the
projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and
maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral
pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive
experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently
outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on
the LLaMA series, \textbf{Conda achieves $2{\sim}2.5\times$ the convergence
speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time.} Further
ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These
results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable
optimizer for large-scale LLM training. The code is released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ML在工业应用中因高昂成本和运营中断而难以广泛实施的问题，特别是中小企业的财务和后勤负担。

Method: 采用API框架策略性分离ML模型生命周期与生产环境，通过浏览器界面实现人机交互控制，支持领域专家调整模型参数。

Result: 该框架能够在不中断生产的情况下维护模型，降低财务和运营风险，增强制造业竞争力。

Conclusion: 该框架为制造业提供了可扩展且易用的ML实施途径，提升生产质量和安全性，增强竞争优势。

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) is critical for industrial
competitiveness, yet its adoption is frequently stalled by the prohibitive
costs and operational disruptions of upgrading legacy systems. The financial
and logistical overhead required to support the full ML lifecycle presents a
formidable barrier to widespread implementation, particularly for small and
medium-sized enterprises. This paper introduces a pragmatic, API-based
framework designed to overcome these challenges by strategically decoupling the
ML model lifecycle from the production environment. Our solution delivers the
analytical power of ML to domain experts through a lightweight, browser-based
interface, eliminating the need for local hardware upgrades and ensuring model
maintenance can occur with zero production downtime. This human-in-the-loop
approach empowers experts with interactive control over model parameters,
fostering trust and facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows.
By mitigating the primary financial and operational risks, this framework
offers a scalable and accessible pathway to enhance production quality and
safety, thereby strengthening the competitive advantage of the manufacturing
sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PU学习算法的实验设置高度不一致，难以确定哪种算法性能更好，需要系统性的基准来公平比较。

Method: 构建PU学习基准，系统研究模型选择标准，识别单样本和双样本设置间的差异，提出校准方法解决内部标签偏移问题。

Result: 创建了可访问、现实且公平的PU学习算法评估框架，确保算法在单样本和双样本设置下的公平比较。

Conclusion: 该基准为未来PU学习算法的评估提供了标准化的环境，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is a weakly supervised binary classification
problem, in which the goal is to learn a binary classifier from only positive
and unlabeled data, without access to negative data. In recent years, many PU
learning algorithms have been developed to improve model performance. However,
experimental settings are highly inconsistent, making it difficult to identify
which algorithm performs better. In this paper, we propose the first PU
learning benchmark to systematically compare PU learning algorithms. During our
implementation, we identify subtle yet critical factors that affect the
realistic and fair evaluation of PU learning algorithms. On the one hand, many
PU learning algorithms rely on a validation set that includes negative data for
model selection. This is unrealistic in traditional PU learning settings, where
no negative data are available. To handle this problem, we systematically
investigate model selection criteria for PU learning. On the other hand, the
problem settings and solutions of PU learning have different families, i.e.,
the one-sample and two-sample settings. However, existing evaluation protocols
are heavily biased towards the one-sample setting and neglect the significant
difference between them. We identify the internal label shift problem of
unlabeled training data for the one-sample setting and propose a simple yet
effective calibration approach to ensure fair comparisons within and across
families. We hope our framework will provide an accessible, realistic, and fair
environment for evaluating PU learning algorithms in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型是否真正具备复杂战略推理能力，而非仅仅在训练数据中进行模式识别。

Method: 构建ChessArena竞争框架，让LLMs在四种不同模式下相互对战，配备排名算法和排行榜，评估基本理解、走子选择和谜题解决等细粒度能力。

Result: 评估了13个LLMs，进行了800多场比赛，没有模型能击败业余人类水平的Maia-1100，有些甚至输给随机玩家。微调的Qwen3-8B性能大幅提升，接近更大的最先进推理模型。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在复杂战略推理方面存在显著局限性，需要通过专门优化来提升此类能力。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities.
However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning
skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling
at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address
this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the
strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic
reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension,
and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a
competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different
play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard.
The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic
understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different
modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal
significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess
engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random
player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the
testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance,
approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Motivation: 将预训练-迁移范式扩展到图结构的运筹学问题面临挑战，因为语言的统计灵活性与图的严格组合约束存在根本冲突。

Method: 引入类似LLM的自监督预训练范式，在图中的随机游走路径上进行训练，使GFM能够内化图的复杂拓扑和组合规则。

Result: 在20到893个节点的网络上进行的全面实验表明，GFM在多种不同优化任务类别中与专用求解器相比具有竞争性性能，同时保持显著更快的推理时间。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了将预训练-迁移框架适应图优化的新范式，为将基础模型创新应用于运筹学打开了大门。

Abstract: The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language
models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models
that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending
this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains
challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility
of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this
gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable
of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By
introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths
generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the
graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of
the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing
neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our
approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's
intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to
tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive
experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM
achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety
of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster
inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the
pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for
applying foundation model innovations to OR.

TL;DR: 提出了一个模拟框架来建模ESP作弊者、非作弊者和轨迹检测器，通过强化学习建模不同可观察性的玩家行为，并将作弊者与检测器的互动建模为对抗性游戏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESP作弊难以检测，因为其效果无法直接观察，且缺乏可靠标注数据。作弊者还会调整行为来伪装作弊，进一步增加了检测难度。

Method: 使用强化学习建模作弊者和非作弊者，检测器对其行为轨迹进行分类。将作弊者与检测器的互动建模为对抗性游戏，引入结构化作弊者模型，根据检测风险动态切换作弊行为。

Result: 实验表明该框架成功模拟了自适应作弊行为，能够战略性地平衡奖励优化和检测规避。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究自适应作弊行为和开发有效作弊检测器提供了一个可控且可扩展的平台。

Abstract: Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game
information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their
effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable
evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is
essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters
often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which
further complicates detection and detector development. To address these
challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP
cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and
non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of
observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we
formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an
adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect
realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that
dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on
detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully
simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward
optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and
extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing
effective cheat detectors.

Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型难以将语言指令作为先验约束融入EEG表示学习，限制了利用语言语义知识统一不同标签和任务的能力。

Method: 提出ELASTIQ模型，包含预训练阶段的谱时重构模块（结合频率掩蔽和两种时间目标）和指令调优阶段的指令条件Q-Former（通过可学习查询对齐EEG标记与文本标签嵌入）。

Conclusion: 分析首次揭示显式任务指令作为语义先验，引导EEG嵌入到连贯且语言基础的空间中，增强了EEG表示的鲁棒性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which
capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the
development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches
still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for
EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic
knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address
this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language
Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates
task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned
EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In
the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction
(STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral
perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to
capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential
dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the
Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention
transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them
with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on
20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual
evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best
average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses
reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic
priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces.
The code and pre-trained weights will be released.

Motivation: 分布式强化学习方法在异构异步计算和通信瓶颈存在的情况下研究不足，需要开发能够有效处理这些挑战的算法。

Method: 设计了两种算法：Rennala NIGT在均匀设置下支持AllReduce操作，Malenia NIGT在异构设置下同时处理异步计算和异构环境。

Result: 在均匀设置下，Rennala NIGT显著提高了总计算和通信复杂度；在异构设置下，Malenia NIGT具有更好的理论保证。实验证实了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的两种算法在分布式强化学习中实现了最先进的效率，特别是在异步和异构环境下表现出色。

Abstract: We study distributed reinforcement learning (RL) with policy gradient methods
under asynchronous and parallel computations and communications. While
non-distributed methods are well understood theoretically and have achieved
remarkable empirical success, their distributed counterparts remain less
explored, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous asynchronous
computations and communication bottlenecks. We introduce two new algorithms,
Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT, which implement asynchronous policy gradient
aggregation and achieve state-of-the-art efficiency. In the homogeneous
setting, Rennala NIGT provably improves the total computational and
communication complexity while supporting the AllReduce operation. In the
heterogeneous setting, Malenia NIGT simultaneously handles asynchronous
computations and heterogeneous environments with strictly better theoretical
guarantees. Our results are further corroborated by experiments, showing that
our methods significantly outperform prior approaches.

Result: 在无噪声和7%噪声条件下模型表现优异（MSE低至1.6e-5，R²高达0.9999）；但在35%高噪声条件下出现过拟合或过度平滑，R²降至0.94甚至负值。

Conclusion: 通用微分方程适用于可扩展、耐噪声的土壤有机碳预测，但现场部署需要噪声感知损失函数、概率建模和更紧密的微生物动力学整合。

Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a foundation of soil health and global climate
resilience, yet its prediction remains difficult because of intricate physical,
chemical, and biological processes. In this study, we explore a Scientific
Machine Learning (SciML) framework built on Universal Differential Equations
(UDEs) to forecast SOC dynamics across soil depth and time. UDEs blend
mechanistic physics, such as advection diffusion transport, with neural
networks that learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration. Using
synthetic datasets, we systematically evaluated six experimental cases,
progressing from clean, noise free benchmarks to stress tests with high (35%)
multiplicative, spatially correlated noise. Our results highlight both the
potential and limitations of the approach. In noise free and moderate noise
settings, the UDE accurately reconstructed SOC dynamics. In clean terminal
profile at 50 years (Case 4) achieved near perfect fidelity, with MSE = 1.6e-5,
and R2 = 0.9999. Case 5, with 7% noise, remained robust (MSE = 3.4e-6, R2 =
0.99998), capturing depth wise SOC trends while tolerating realistic
measurement uncertainty. In contrast, Case 3 (35% noise at t = 0) showed clear
evidence of overfitting: the model reproduced noisy inputs with high accuracy
but lost generalization against the clean truth (R2 = 0.94). Case 6 (35% noise
at t = 50) collapsed toward overly smooth mean profiles, failing to capture
depth wise variability and yielding negative R2, underscoring the limits of
standard training under severe uncertainty. These findings suggest that UDEs
are well suited for scalable, noise tolerant SOC forecasting, though advancing
toward field deployment will require noise aware loss functions, probabilistic
modelling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出SALT方法，使用固定教师模型进行视频表示学习，取代EMA更新机制，实现更简单、可扩展和计算高效的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: V-JEPA方法使用EMA更新教师模型虽然防止表示崩溃，但增加了模型选择复杂度并耦合了师生架构。本文旨在简化这一过程。

Method: 两阶段训练：首先训练目标编码器进行像素重建，然后冻结该教师模型，训练学生模型预测教师潜在表示中的掩码区域。

Result: SALT方法在多个基准测试中优于V-JEPA 2编码器，计算效率更高，且在相同FLOPs下获得更高精度。

Conclusion: SALT是EMA自蒸馏的简单、可扩展和计算高效替代方案，学生模型质量对教师质量具有鲁棒性，计算预算应主要分配给学生。

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable
off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space
with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents
representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples
teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show
that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with
a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze
it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This
leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT
(Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into
pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student),
increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the
ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically,
our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen
backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more
compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher
probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs
Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to
teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal
teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly
favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and
compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video
representation learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
raw data. However, it remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can
compromise the aggregation of locally updated parameters at the central server.
Similarity-aware aggregation has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate
such attacks by identifying and filtering out malicious clients based on
similarity between client model parameters and those derived from clean data,
i.e., data that is uncorrupted and trustworthy. However, existing methods adopt
this strategy only in FL systems with clean data, making them inapplicable to
settings where such data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose H+, a novel
similarity-aware aggregation approach that not only outperforms existing
methods in scenarios with clean data, but also extends applicability to FL
systems without any clean data. Specifically, H+ randomly selects
$r$-dimensional segments from the $p$-dimensional parameter vectors uploaded to
the server and applies a similarity check function $H$ to compare each segment
against a reference vector, preserving the most similar client vectors for
aggregation. The reference vector is derived either from existing robust
algorithms when clean data is unavailable or directly from clean data.
Repeating this process $K$ times enables effective identification of honest

analytical time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(KMr)$, where $M$ is the number of

state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, demonstrating substantial robustness
improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and
multiple types of traditional Byzantine attacks, across all evaluated scenarios
and benchmark datasets.

*Siyang Li,Yize Chen,Yan Guo,Ming Huang,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种物理引导的不变学习方法iMOOE，通过定义PDE系统的双重不变性原理，构建了不变性对齐的混合算子专家架构，实现了在偏微分方程动力学预测中的零样本外分布泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实物理环境中的PDE系统参数多变，如何在有限训练数据下泛化到未见的外分布预测场景至关重要。现有方法虽然关注跨域泛化表示，但零样本OOD泛化能力不足，仍需测试时样本进行域适应，因为尚未充分研究PDE动力学系统中的基本物理不变性。

Method: 首先明确定义了双重PDE不变性原理：成分算子及其组合关系在不同域和PDE系统演化中保持不变。然后提出iMOOE方法，包含不变性对齐的混合算子专家架构和频率增强的不变学习目标，以捕捉这种双重不变性。

Result: 在模拟基准和实际应用中进行的广泛实验验证了iMOOE在分布内性能的优越性，以及在多样化OOD预测场景中的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过明确建模PDE系统的物理不变性，iMOOE方法显著提升了偏微分方程动力学预测的零样本外分布泛化能力，为科学和工程问题中的物理动力学预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to
forecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science
and engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system
parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen
out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is
of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on
discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics
trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains
deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are
still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE
dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we
first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out
that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant
across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this
two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method
termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert
architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive
experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate
iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization
capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多目标进化学习框架，在游戏关卡生成中同时优化多个多样性指标，通过帕累托前沿提供可玩性与多样性之间的权衡选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关卡生成方法往往无法全面评估多维度多样性指标，这些指标之间存在冲突、互补或混合关系，需要更全面的多样性评估方法。

Method: 将模型训练制定为多目标学习问题，每个多样性指标作为独立目标，提出多目标进化学习框架同时优化多个多样性指标。

Result: 在超级马里奥兄弟基准测试中，该框架能增强多维度多样性，识别生成模型的帕累托前沿，提供可玩性与两个代表性多样性指标之间的权衡范围。

Conclusion: 该框架使决策者能够根据各种场景和玩家、设计师的多样化需求，做出明智的生成器选择。

Abstract: In recent years, the generation of diverse game levels has gained increasing
interest, contributing to a richer and more engaging gaming experience. A
number of level diversity metrics have been proposed in literature, which are
naturally multi-dimensional, leading to conflicted, complementary, or both
relationships among these dimensions. However, existing level generation
approaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across those
dimensions. This paper aims to expand horizons of level diversity by
considering multi-dimensional diversity when training generative models. We
formulate the model training as a multi-objective learning problem, where each
diversity metric is treated as a distinct objective. Furthermore, a
multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimises multiple
diversity metrics simultaneously throughout the model training process is
proposed. Our case study on the commonly used benchmark Super Mario Bros.
demonstrates that our proposed framework can enhance multi-dimensional
diversity and identify a Pareto front of generative models, which provides a
range of tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics,
including a content-based one and a player-centered one. Such capability
enables decision-makers to make informed choices when selecting generators
accommodating a variety of scenarios and the diverse needs of players and
designers.

*Thibaud Gloaguen,Robin Staab,Nikola Jovanović,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对扩散语言模型(DLMs)的水印技术，解决了传统自回归语言模型水印方案无法直接应用于DLMs的问题，通过期望上下文和提升水印强度的策略实现了高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型(DLMs)能够以任意顺序生成标记，这与标准自回归语言模型(ARLMs)的顺序生成方式不同。现有的ARLM水印方案依赖于先前生成的标记，这在DLM生成中并不总是可用，因此需要专门为DLMs设计水印方案。

Method: 通过两种策略解决挑战：(1)在上下文标记尚未确定时，在期望上应用水印；(2)提升那些在作为其他标记上下文时能增加水印强度的标记。同时保持水印检测器不变。

Result: 实验评估表明，DLM水印实现了>99%的真阳性率，对质量影响极小，并且达到了与现有ARLM水印相似的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项研究首次实现了可靠的DLM水印技术，为扩散语言模型提供了有效的版权保护方案。

Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models
(DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in
contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate
tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key
challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is
that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available
with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying
the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are
yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark
strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while
keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with
minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM
watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次成功将进化策略（ES）扩展到大规模语言模型（LLM）的完整参数微调，证明ES在数十亿参数规模下仍能高效搜索，并在多个方面优于强化学习（RL）微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管进化策略（ES）曾在百万参数级模型上表现出与强化学习（RL）相当的性能，但由于对其可扩展性的悲观预期，在LLM微调中被忽视。本研究旨在重新评估ES在大规模LLM微调中的潜力。

Method: 采用进化策略（ES）对预训练LLM的完整参数进行微调，探索其在数十亿参数规模下的搜索效率。

Result: ES在样本效率、长周期奖励容忍度、对不同基础LLM的鲁棒性、奖励黑客攻击倾向性以及跨运行稳定性等多个方面优于现有RL微调方法。

Conclusion: 进化策略为LLM微调开辟了超越当前RL技术的新方向，证明了ES在大规模参数优化中的有效性和优势。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is
a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is
arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of
many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once
showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters,
was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger
models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for
fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES
can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL
fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency,
tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less
tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It
therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond
what current RL techniques provide. The source codes are provided at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AXIS框架通过为冻结LLM提供三种互补提示来解决时间序列异常检测的解释性问题：数值符号提示、上下文集成的时间序列编码器提示和任务先验提示，显著提升了解释质量并达到竞争性检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将时间序列直接序列化为文本存在上下文缺失和模态对齐问题，无法充分利用LLM的解释能力来回答异常发生的时间、模式和原因。

Method: AXIS框架不直接序列化时间序列，而是为冻结LLM提供三种提示：(i)数值符号提示用于数值基础，(ii)从预训练时间序列编码器提取的上下文集成、步长对齐提示以捕捉细粒度动态，(iii)编码全局异常特征的任务先验提示。

Result: 广泛的实验（包括LLM和人工评估）表明，AXIS产生的解释质量显著更高，检测精度与通用LLM、专用时间序列LLM和时间序列视觉语言模型相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: AXIS成功解决了时间序列到文本转换的模态对齐问题，为时间序列异常检测提供了高质量的解释能力，同时保持了良好的检测性能。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that
articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits
and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series
as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental
challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process
long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization
suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment
between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework
that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of
direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary
hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical
grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a
pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a
task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to
facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark
featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual
grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both
LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of
significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy
compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series
Vision Language Models.

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练小型到中型Transformer解码器（30M-200M参数）时，相比AdamW可节省48-52%的计算量，同时保持或改善最终困惑度。与MLA和MoE结合时，能实现68%内存减少和3.2倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Muon优化器的理论基础、收敛特性及其与现代架构优化的协同作用，验证其在计算效率方面的优势。

Method: 提供严格的理论分析包括收敛率证明、谱正则化特性、与Stiefel流形上自然梯度下降的联系，以及谱范数下最速梯度下降的等价性。结合MLA和MoE进行实证研究。

Result: Muon在保持数据效率的同时扩展了帕累托边界，特别是在大批量训练时。实证显示达到目标损失所需计算量仅为AdamW的48-52%，MLA+MoE+Muon组合实现68%内存减少和3.2倍推理加速，困惑度改善8-12%。

Conclusion: Muon是一个有理论基础、鲁棒的AdamW替代方案，特别在与现代效率技术和大批量训练机制结合时表现出色。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical study of the Muon
optimizer for training transformers only with a small to medium decoder (30M -
200M parameters), with an emphasis on its mathematical foundations, convergence
properties and synergistic interactions with modern architectural
optimizations. Building on recent work showing Muon's scalability, we provide
rigorous theoretical analysis including: (i)showing the convergence rate under
standard assumptions, (ii) spectral regularization properties that prevent
gradient explosion, (iii) connection to natural gradient descent on the Stiefel
manifold, and (iv) equivalence to steepest gradient descent under the spectral
norm. Crucially, we demonstrate that Muon expands the Pareto frontier in the
compute-time trade-off by maintaining superior data efficiency at large batch
sizes, a key finding of~\cite{essentialai2025muon} that we validate across our
model scales. Empirically, Muon reaches the target loss with 48-52\% of the
training calculated by AdamW while maintaining or improving the final
perplexity, consistent with larger-scale results. When combined with Multi-Head
Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), we observe multiplicative
efficiency gains: MLA+MoE+Muon achieves 68\% memory reduction and 3.2$\times$
inference speedup, while improving perplexity by 8-12\%. We provide detailed
procedures on 15 architectural and optimizer components, stability analyzes
across 100+ training runs, and practical implementation guidelines including
Newton-Schulz coefficients $(3.4445, -4.7750, 2.0315)$ optimized
by~\cite{su2024muonblog}. Our theoretical analysis and comprehensive
experiments establish Muon as a principled, robust alternative to AdamW that
particularly excels when combined with modern efficiency techniques and
large-batch training regimes.

TL;DR: 提出ScatterAD方法，利用多元时间序列数据在高维空间中的散射现象作为归纳信号，通过建模时间和拓扑维度的表示散射来增强时空异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法独立建模空间或时间依赖关系，导致表示学习不理想且对高维空间中异常分散的敏感性有限。实证分析发现正常和异常样本在高维空间中都会散射，特别是异常样本更加分散。

Method: 提出ScatterAD方法，包含拓扑编码器捕获图结构散射，时间编码器通过最小化相邻时间步的均方误差来约束过度散射。引入对比融合机制确保时间和拓扑表示的互补性。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ScatterAD在多元时间序列异常检测上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过最大化时间和拓扑视图之间的条件互信息，可以提高跨视图一致性并增强更具区分性的表示，从而有效提升异常检测性能。

Abstract: One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies
in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However,
traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal
dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and
limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this
work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous
samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples
are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as
scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample
representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance
spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model
representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD
incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering
and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared
error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive
fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and
topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that
maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological
views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that
ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series
anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository:

TL;DR: BiHDTrans是一种高效的神经符号二元超维Transformer，将自注意力机制集成到HD计算范式中，结合了HD计算的高效表示能力和Transformer的时间建模能力，在资源受限的边缘环境中实现准确、可扩展和低延迟的多变量时间序列分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备产生大量多变量时间序列数据，需要在资源受限的边缘环境中进行高效准确处理。HD计算虽然高效但难以捕捉复杂时间模式，而Transformer擅长序列建模但计算和内存开销大。

Method: 提出BiHDTrans模型，将自注意力机制集成到HD计算范式中，在硬件上使用FPGA加速，利用高维表示的独立同分布特性实现流水线处理。

Result: BiHDTrans比最先进的HD计算模型准确率至少提高14.47%，比最先进的二元Transformer平均准确率高6.67%。在FPGA上推理延迟比最先进二元Transformer低39.4倍。即使减少64%超空间维度，仍比最先进二元Transformer准确率高1-2%，模型大小减少4.4倍，延迟比全维度基线降低49.8%。

Conclusion: BiHDTrans弥合了Transformer的表达能力和HD计算效率之间的差距，实现了准确、可扩展和低延迟的多变量时间序列分类。

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to an
unprecedented volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data, requiring
efficient and accurate processing for timely decision-making in
resource-constrained edge environments. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with
its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in
classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while
Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory
overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary
hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD
computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing
with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and
achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With
hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the
independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional
representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary
Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic
high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than
directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy.
Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains
competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing
SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as
well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional
baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the
expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling
accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.

Result: 在多样化大规模多模态下游任务中验证了方法的有效性，实现了显著压缩而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: 模态对齐是实现语义压缩的关键推动因素，所提方法在保持性能的同时实现了显著的内存节省。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that
align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong
generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of
storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve
semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings
while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across
modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the
modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different
modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the
gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but
expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore,
their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This
enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding
significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic
compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained
encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale
multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a
key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach
achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: 该进化训练框架能有效压缩模型尺寸，显著提升训练效率，适合在PC和边缘计算设备上部署。

Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large
language models(LLM). The models are divided into several
experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter
values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW
optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on
the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current
expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert
would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight
of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the
same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the
model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the
training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments
show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code
is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy
deployment on PCs and edge computing devices.

Motivation: 联邦学习在数据分布扰动下性能会显著下降，现有基于DRO的方法往往忽视本地数据集中异常值的有害影响，这些异常值会不成比例地偏倚学习模型。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性，算法具有收敛保证。

Conclusion: 所提出的分布异常值鲁棒联邦学习方法能够有效处理数据分布扰动和异常值问题，在联邦学习环境中提供鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct
data sharing, but its performance can degrade significantly in the presence of
data distribution perturbations. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
provides a principled framework for handling this by optimizing performance
against the worst-case distributions within a prescribed ambiguity set.
However, existing DRO-based FL methods often overlook the detrimental impact of
outliers in local datasets, which can disproportionately bias the learned
models. In this work, we study distributionally robust federated learning with
explicit outlier resilience. We introduce a novel ambiguity set based on the
unbalanced Wasserstein distance, which jointly captures geometric
distributional shifts and incorporates a non-geometric Kullback--Leibler
penalization to mitigate the influence of outliers. This formulation naturally
leads to a challenging min--max--max optimization problem. To enable
decentralized training, we reformulate the problem as a tractable Lagrangian
penalty optimization, which admits robustness certificates. Building on this
reformulation, we propose the distributionally outlier-robust federated
learning algorithm and establish its convergence guarantees. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks employing parameter-sharing schemes
have emerged as powerful models for leveraging a wide range of data symmetries,
significantly enhancing the generalization and computational efficiency of the
resulting models. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated
promise through their improved interpretability and expressivity compared to
traditional architectures based on MLPs. While equivariant KANs have been
explored in recent literature for a few specific data types, a principled
framework for applying them to data with permutation symmetries in a general
context remains absent. This paper introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN), a
principled approach to constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for
arbitrary permutation symmetry groups, unifying and significantly extending
previous work in this domain. We derive the basic construction of these FS-KAN
layers by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup
and provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that FS-KANs have the same
expressive power as networks that use standard parameter-sharing layers,
allowing us to transfer well-known and important expressivity results from
parameter-sharing networks to FS-KANs. Empirical evaluations on multiple data
types and symmetry groups show that FS-KANs exhibit superior data efficiency
compared to standard parameter-sharing layers, by a wide margin in certain
cases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KANs, making
them an excellent architecture choice in low-data regimes.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have recently gained prominence in Continual Learning
(CL) due to their strong performance and memory efficiency. A prevalent
strategy in this paradigm assigns a dedicated subset of prompts to each task,
which, while effective, incurs substantial computational overhead and causes
memory requirements to scale linearly with the number of tasks. Conversely,
approaches employing a single shared prompt across tasks offer greater
efficiency but often suffer from degraded performance due to knowledge
interference. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose SMoPE, a novel framework
that integrates the benefits of both task-specific and shared prompt
strategies. Inspired by recent findings on the relationship between Prefix
Tuning and Mixture of Experts (MoE), SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into
multiple "prompt experts" within a sparse MoE architecture. For each input,
only a select subset of relevant experts is activated, effectively mitigating
interference. To facilitate expert selection, we introduce a prompt-attention
score aggregation mechanism that computes a unified proxy score for each
expert, enabling dynamic and sparse activation. Additionally, we propose an
adaptive noise mechanism to encourage balanced expert utilization while
preserving knowledge from prior tasks. To further enhance expert
specialization, we design a prototype-based loss function that leverages prefix
keys as implicit memory representations. Extensive experiments across multiple
CL benchmarks demonstrate that SMoPE consistently outperforms task-specific
prompt methods and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art
approaches, all while significantly reducing parameter counts and computational
costs.

### [259] [Guided Uncertainty Learning Using a Post-Hoc Evidential Meta-Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24492)
*Charmaine Barker,Daniel Bethell,Simos Gerasimou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUIDE是一个轻量级的证据学习元模型方法，可附加到冻结的深度学习模型上，明确学习如何以及何时表达不确定性，无需重新训练或修改基础模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的分布偏移下的不确定性量化仍然是深度学习模型部署的主要障碍。现有的事后方法要么继承错误的置信度，要么只是重塑预测，而没有教会模型何时应该不确定。

Method: GUIDE通过校准阶段识别显著内部特征，然后使用这些特征构建噪声驱动的课程，教会模型如何以及何时表达不确定性。该方法无需重新训练、无需架构修改、无需手动选择中间层。

Result: GUIDE避免了从基础模型中蒸馏过度自信，将分布外检测提高了约77%，对抗攻击检测提高了约80%，同时保持分布内性能。在各种基准测试中始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: GUIDE证明了需要主动引导不确定性，以缩小预测置信度与可靠性之间的差距。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification remains a major obstacle to the
deployment of deep learning models under distributional shift. Existing
post-hoc approaches that retrofit pretrained models either inherit misplaced
confidence or merely reshape predictions, without teaching the model when to be
uncertain. We introduce GUIDE, a lightweight evidential learning meta-model
approach that attaches to a frozen deep learning model and explicitly learns
how and when to be uncertain. GUIDE identifies salient internal features via a
calibration stage, and then employs these features to construct a noise-driven
curriculum that teaches the model how and when to express uncertainty. GUIDE
requires no retraining, no architectural modifications, and no manual
intermediate-layer selection to the base deep learning model, thus ensuring
broad applicability and minimal user intervention. The resulting model avoids
distilling overconfidence from the base model, improves out-of-distribution
detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while preserving
in-distribution performance. Across diverse benchmarks, GUIDE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the need for actively
guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and
reliability.

*Zhaomin Wu,Haodong Zhao,Ziyang Wang,Jizhou Guo,Qian Wang,Bingsheng He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出LLM DNA概念，将大语言模型的功能行为表示为低维、双Lipschitz表示，用于追踪模型间的演化关系，并构建了LLM进化树。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型数量爆炸式增长，但模型间的演化关系（如微调、蒸馏、适应）往往缺乏文档记录或模糊不清，给LLM管理带来困难。现有方法受限于任务特定性、固定模型集或对分词器和架构的严格假设。

Method: 受生物DNA启发，数学定义LLM DNA为功能行为的低维双Lipschitz表示，证明其满足遗传和遗传决定论特性，并建立DNA存在性。基于此理论，推导出通用、可扩展、无需训练的DNA提取流程。

Result: 在305个LLM上的实验表明，DNA与先前有限子集研究一致，在特定任务上达到优越或竞争性性能。DNA比较揭示了LLM间先前未记录的关联，构建的进化树显示从编码器-解码器到仅解码器架构的转变，反映时间进展，并揭示不同LLM家族的演化速度差异。

Conclusion: LLM DNA为理解大语言模型演化关系提供了理论基础和实用工具，能够有效追踪模型间的遗传关系并构建进化树，解决了LLM管理中的透明度问题。

Abstract: The explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) has created a vast but
opaque landscape: millions of models exist, yet their evolutionary
relationships through fine-tuning, distillation, or adaptation are often
undocumented or unclear, complicating LLM management. Existing methods are
limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about
tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these
limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional,
bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA
satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the
existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable,
training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA
aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or
competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons
uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct
the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with
shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal
progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.

*Jonas Hübotter,Patrik Wolf,Alexander Shevchenko,Dennis Jüni,Andreas Krause,Gil Kur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出测试时训练(TTT)有效的原因是基础模型在全局上仍然参数不足，TTT通过专门化机制在泛化后聚焦于测试任务相关概念，从而获得比全局训练更小的分布内测试误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对测试时训练为何有效缺乏理解，传统解释主要关注分布外适应或特权数据，但随着基础模型规模扩大且多数测试数据是分布内数据，这些解释受到质疑。

Method: 在线性表示假设下建立理论模型，通过稀疏自编码器在ImageNet上验证关键假设，并在图像和语言任务上进行扩展研究。

Result: 实证验证了语义相关数据点仅由少数共享概念解释，扩展研究确定了专门化最有效的机制。

Conclusion: TTT通过专门化机制弥补基础模型的全局参数不足，在分布内场景下显著提升性能，为理解TTT有效性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a
model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and
have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is
limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations
mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to
out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the
growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution
questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain
globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization
after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task.
Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in
which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than
global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by
training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related
data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform
scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical
implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most
effective.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何通过物理归纳偏置在模型效能和效率之间取得平衡，证明物理偏置可以显著提升效率同时保持或改进效能，并主张效率应与效能一起成为机器学习模型开发的核心考量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型开发过度关注效能提升，导致模型规模庞大、资源消耗巨大、碳足迹显著。本文旨在探索物理归纳偏置如何提供模型效能与效率之间的有益权衡。

Method: 研究了多种时空预测模型，包括标准物理信息模型和更新的流匹配模型，通过嵌入不同层次的物理归纳偏置来评估效能与效率的权衡。

Result: 实验表明，嵌入物理归纳偏置可以显著提高模型效率（计算、能耗、碳足迹），同时保持甚至改进任务效能。流匹配模型被证明是时空预测的通用有效方法。

Conclusion: 物理归纳偏置为提升机器学习模型效率和减少碳足迹提供了原则性方法，模型效率应与模型效能一起成为模型开发和部署的核心考量因素。

Abstract: Development of modern deep learning methods has been driven primarily by the
push for improving model efficacy (accuracy metrics). This sole focus on
efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive
resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model
life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer
useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy,
and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a
task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels
of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into
the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even
improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using
standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness
of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for
spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics
inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce
the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model
efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration
driving machine learning model development and deployment.

TL;DR: LEAF是一个用于少样本持续事件检测的专家混合框架，通过LoRA参数化专家、语义感知专家选择和对比学习来解决数据有限和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在少样本持续事件检测中存在严重遗忘问题，因为完全微调共享基础模型会导致任务间知识干扰，且数据增强策略可能引入不自然或语义扭曲的输入。

Method: LEAF将专家混合架构集成到基础模型中，每个专家使用LoRA矩阵参数化。通过语义感知专家选择机制动态路由实例，结合标签描述引导的对比学习目标，并使用知识蒸馏防止内存缓冲区过拟合。

Result: 在多个FCED基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LEAF始终达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LEAF通过专家专业化、减少知识干扰和改善有限数据泛化能力，有效解决了少样本持续事件检测中的挑战。

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of
learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due
to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge
interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation
strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To
address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based
framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts
architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection
mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling
expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve
generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive
learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level
semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on
the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that
transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive
experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法要么需要在大规模配对数据集上进行昂贵的联合训练，要么依赖可能无法捕捉全局多模态一致性的成对相似性。

Method: 提出多模态扩散引导(MDG)，利用模态嵌入空间来强制执行视频、音频和文本之间的统一对齐，这是一种轻量级、即插即用的控制信号，可在任何预训练音频扩散模型上应用而无需重新训练。

Result: 在VGGSound和AudioCaps数据集上的实验表明，MDG相比基线方法持续改善了感知质量和多模态对齐。

Conclusion: 证明了联合多模态引导在视频到音频生成中的有效性，提供了一种无需重新训练的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned audio from silent videos, with potential applications in video editing,
Foley sound design, and assistive multimedia. Although the excellent results,
existing approaches either require costly joint training on large-scale paired
datasets or rely on pairwise similarities that may fail to capture global
multimodal coherence. In this work, we propose a novel training-free multimodal
guidance mechanism for V2A diffusion that leverages the volume spanned by the
modality embeddings to enforce unified alignment across video, audio, and text.
The proposed multimodal diffusion guidance (MDG) provides a lightweight,
plug-and-play control signal that can be applied on top of any pretrained audio
diffusion model without retraining. Experiments on VGGSound and AudioCaps
demonstrate that our MDG consistently improves perceptual quality and
multimodal alignment compared to baselines, proving the effectiveness of a
joint multimodal guidance for V2A.

TL;DR: SWAX是一种结合滑动窗口注意力机制和xLSTM线性RNN层的混合架构，研究发现较小的滑动窗口反而能提升长上下文性能，通过随机改变窗口大小训练，在短上下文和长上下文任务上都优于常规窗口注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明混合架构优于单独的注意力或RNN架构，但窗口长度的影响以及注意力与RNN层之间的相互作用尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出SWAX混合架构，结合滑动窗口注意力和xLSTM线性RNN层，采用随机改变滑动窗口大小的训练方法。

Result: 反直觉发现：更大的滑动窗口不会改善长上下文性能；小窗口注意力通过减少对注意力机制的依赖，能更好地训练xLSTM的长期记忆；随机窗口训练在短上下文和长上下文问题上都显著优于常规窗口注意力。

Conclusion: SWAX通过随机窗口训练策略有效平衡了短上下文和长上下文任务的需求，证明了混合架构中注意力与RNN层协同工作的重要性。

Abstract: Recent works show that hybrid architectures combining sliding window softmax
attention layers with linear recurrent neural network (RNN) layers outperform
both of these architectures taken separately. However, the impact of the window
length and the interplay between softmax attention and linear RNN layers remain
under-studied. In this work, we introduce SWAX, a hybrid architecture
consisting of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers.
  A counter-intuitive finding with SWAX is that larger sliding windows do not
improve the long-context performance. In fact, short window attention
encourages the model to better train the long-term memory of the xLSTM, by
relying less on the softmax attention mechanism for long context-retrieval.
  The issue with small sliding windows is that they are detrimental for
short-context tasks, which could be solved with information from moderately
larger sliding windows otherwise. Therefore, we train SWAX by stochastically
changing the sliding window size, forcing the model to leverage both a longer
context window and the xLSTM memory. SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes
significantly outperforms regular window attention both on short and
long-context problems.

Motivation: 先前研究主要依赖低雷诺数数值模拟，本研究旨在在具有挑战性的实验环境中实现实时控制，解决执行器延迟等实际约束问题。

Method: 使用深度强化学习算法，提供状态反馈(位移和速度)，通过旋转驱动控制涡激振动，并比较了仅使用状态反馈与增加历史控制动作两种策略。

Result: 仅使用状态反馈时，DRL智能体学习到低频旋转控制策略，实现80%振动抑制；增加历史控制动作后，智能体学习到高频旋转控制策略，实现超过95%振动衰减。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习在真实实验中具有适应性，能够克服执行器延迟等仪器限制，为主动流动控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV)
in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary
actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number
numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a
challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints
such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state
feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL
agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80%
vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While
this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance
achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is
attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning
algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a
high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex
shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate
the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to
overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.

Conclusion: OpenVLA确实隐式学习世界模型，且这种能力随着训练进展而出现，为理解VLA模型内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision Language Action models (VLAs) trained with policy-based reinforcement
learning (RL) encode complex behaviors without explicitly modeling
environmental dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly
learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental
methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe
whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent
knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between
embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition
vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non
linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically
significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines
(embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as
opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the
predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that
the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline
leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.

Conclusion: 该框架能够实时近似最优策略，同时显式捕捉决策与PDE动态之间的耦合关系，为PDE约束优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many
scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and
material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control
inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables,
and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints.
This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires
handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that
integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic
predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently
approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the
optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to
approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables
real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the
coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach
on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation,
heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution
quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct
Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of
magnitude improvement in computational speed.

Conclusion: SAIP通过自适应尺度调整有效解决了现有方法中固定尺度平衡的局限性，显著提升了扩散模型在逆问题求解中的性能

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks
such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a
Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score
with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable,
estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these
methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood
contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies
across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address
this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the
scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone.
SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves
reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including
challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: OrthAlign通过参数层面的正交分解从根本上解决了多目标对齐中的梯度冲突，实现了稳定收敛和显著性能改进。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing
multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at
the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing
objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses
on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to
mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of
resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present
OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging
orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level
conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically
decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that
optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically
non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical
guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal
subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit
linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable
convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:
I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from
34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,
and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of
13.96%.

Abstract: By embedding physical intuition, network architectures enforce fundamental
properties, such as energy conservation laws, leading to plausible predictions.
Yet, scaling these models to intrinsically high-dimensional systems remains a
significant challenge. This paper introduces Geometric Reduced-order
Hamiltonian Neural Network (RO-HNN), a novel physics-inspired neural network
that combines the conservation laws of Hamiltonian mechanics with the
scalability of model order reduction. RO-HNN is built on two core components: a
novel geometrically-constrained symplectic autoencoder that learns a
low-dimensional, structure-preserving symplectic submanifold, and a geometric
Hamiltonian neural network that models the dynamics on the submanifold. Our
experiments demonstrate that RO-HNN provides physically-consistent, stable, and
generalizable predictions of complex high-dimensional dynamics, thereby
effectively extending the scope of Hamiltonian neural networks to
high-dimensional physical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在组合推理任务中经常失败，特别是存在"两跳推理诅咒"现象，需要解决这一组合性差距。

Method: 引入Identity Bridge机制，在零跳身份任务上监督模型；使用简化的Emb-MLP模型进行理论分析；通过小初始化或权重衰减增强正则化效果。

Result: 身份监督重塑了模型的潜在几何结构，通过隐式核范数正则化促进低秩解，使模型能够成功执行分布外两跳推理；在大规模模型中观察到通过潜在记忆实现两跳推理。

Conclusion: Identity Bridge机制有效解决了组合推理问题，身份监督通过几何对齐增强模型的隐式推理能力，为提升大模型推理能力提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances, large language models often fail at
compositional reasoning tasks, a phenomenon exemplified by the ``curse of
two-hop reasoning''. This paper introduces the Identity Bridge, a simple yet
powerful mechanism that resolves this compositionality gap by supervising the
model on a zero-hop identity task. We demonstrate empirically that this
addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop
reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon,
we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving
that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this
alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during
optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across
tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to
enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment
effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our
investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop
reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for
enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities.

*Max van Spengler,Artem Moskalev,Tommaso Mansi,Mangal Prakash,Rui Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperHELM是一个在双曲空间中实现mRNA序列掩码语言模型预训练的框架，通过混合设计将双曲层置于欧几里得骨干之上，使学习表示与mRNA和氨基酸关系的生物层次结构对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型越来越多地应用于蛋白质和mRNA等生物序列，但其默认的欧几里得几何可能与生物数据固有的层次结构不匹配。双曲几何为适应层次数据提供了更好的替代方案，但尚未应用于mRNA序列的语言建模。

Method: 采用混合设计，在欧几里得骨干网络之上添加双曲层，实现mRNA序列在双曲空间中的掩码语言模型预训练。

Result: 在多个多物种数据集上，在10个涉及属性预测的任务中有9个优于欧几里得基线，平均提升10%；在长序列和低GC含量序列的分布外泛化方面表现优异；在抗体区域注释任务中，比层次感知的欧几里得模型注释准确率提高3%。

Conclusion: 双曲几何是mRNA序列层次语言建模的有效归纳偏置。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly applied to biological sequences like
proteins and mRNA, yet their default Euclidean geometry may mismatch the
hierarchical structures inherent to biological data. While hyperbolic geometry
provides a better alternative for accommodating hierarchical data, it has yet
to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we
introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model
pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with
hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned
representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship
between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it
outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property
prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution
generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region
annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation
accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive
bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.

TL;DR: T-POP是一种实时个性化方法，通过在线收集用户偏好反馈来指导冻结LLM的解码过程，无需更新模型参数即可实现快速个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有个性化方法对新用户的冷启动问题，这些方法通常需要大量用户数据或资源密集的微调。

Method: 结合测试时对齐和决斗老虎机算法，在线学习用户偏好的奖励函数，通过智能查询平衡探索和利用。

Result: 在广泛实验中，T-POP实现了快速且数据高效的个性化，显著优于现有基线方法，并随着用户交互增加而持续改进。

Conclusion: T-POP为LLM实时个性化提供了有效解决方案，能够在新用户场景下快速适应个人偏好。

Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to individual user preferences is
a critical step beyond generating generically helpful responses. However,
current personalization methods are ill-suited for new users, as they typically
require either slow, resource-intensive fine-tuning or a substantial amount of
pre-existing user data, creating a significant cold-start problem. To address
this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by
learning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text
generation. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference
Feedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment
with dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the
decoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that
captures user preferences. By leveraging dueling bandits, T-POP intelligently
queries the user to efficiently balance between exploring their preferences and
exploiting the learned knowledge to generate personalized text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient
personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing
consistent improvement with more user interactions.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于多臂老虎机的联邦提示优化框架，解决大语言模型提示优化的三个关键挑战：黑盒性质、样本效率和隐私保护协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型性能对输入提示高度敏感，但实际应用面临三大挑战：(1) 强大专有LLM的黑盒性质，(2) 查询成本导致的样本效率需求，(3) 多用户隐私保护协作需求。

Method: 提出了FedPOB算法（联邦线性UCB变体），代理通过共享模型参数而非原始数据进行协作；进一步扩展到比较用户反馈场景，提出FedPOB-Pref算法（基于联邦对决老虎机）。

Result: 大量实验表明，FedPOB和FedPOB-Pref显著优于现有基线方法，且随着参与代理数量增加，性能持续提升。

Conclusion: 多臂老虎机框架有效解决了联邦提示优化的三个核心挑战，实现了样本高效、隐私保护的协作学习。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
input prompt, making prompt optimization a critical task. However, real-world
application is hindered by three major challenges: (1) the black-box nature of
powerful proprietary LLMs, (2) the need for high sample efficiency due to query
costs, and (3) the desire for privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple
users. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel
framework for sample-efficient federated prompt optimization based on
multi-armed bandits (MABs). The MAB framework is uniquely suited for this
problem as it is (1) inherently a black-box optimization method, (2)
practically sample-efficient, and (3) enables collaborative learning with
theoretically guaranteed benefit from more participating agents. We first
propose the Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits (FedPOB) algorithm, a
federated variant of the Linear UCB algorithm, where agents collaborate by
sharing model parameters instead of raw data. We then extend our approach to
the practical setting of comparative user feedback by introducing FedPOB with
Preference Feedback (FedPOB-Pref), an efficient algorithm based on federated
dueling bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and
FedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their
performance consistently improves as more agents participate in the
collaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach.

Motivation: 基于人类反馈的强化学习(RLHF)奖励模型在长尾分布上存在系统性失败，导致奖励黑客攻击和错位问题。受语言模型中罕见令牌分布式专业化的启发，假设奖励模型也会为长尾场景开发功能不同的电路。

Method: 提出机制可解释性框架识别奖励模型中处理罕见事件的专用神经回路，引入电路感知奖励训练(CART)，使用电路分析指导数据增强、正则化和集成策略。

Result: 建立了电路专业化、奖励泛化边界和长尾性能之间的形式化联系，为奖励模型失败提供了理论见解。

Conclusion: 该方法既提供了奖励模型失败的理论见解，又提供了提高长尾鲁棒性的实际干预措施。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) reward models exhibit
systematic failures on longtail distributions, leading to reward hacking and
misalignment. We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that
identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in
reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization
for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we
hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for
longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections
between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail
performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which
uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble
strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model
failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散VAE中的离散随机变量无法精确微分参数化，传统方法如Gumbel-Softmax重参数化或REINFORCE在高维任务中效果有限。

Method: 结合策略搜索技术，利用非参数编码器的自然梯度更新参数编码器，无需重参数化，配合自动步长调整和基于transformer的编码器。

Result: 在ImageNet等挑战性数据集上，优于近似重参数化方法和基于量化的离散自编码器，在ImageNet 256上FID得分提升20%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效训练离散VAE，在高维数据重建任务中取得显著改进。

Abstract: Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit
efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions,
enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However,
discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable
parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations,
such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient
estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that
have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image
reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a
training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a
non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring
reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation
and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as
ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and
quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional
data from compact latent spaces, achieving a 20% improvement on FID Score for
ImageNet 256.

TL;DR: Q-Net是一个数据高效且可解释的队列长度估计框架，结合了环路检测器车辆计数和聚合浮动车数据，使用AI增强的卡尔曼滤波器在噪声协方差未知的情况下实现鲁棒估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决信号交叉口在部分观测条件下队列长度估计的挑战，特别是在交通守恒假设被违反时，需要一种能够融合不同时空分辨率数据源的鲁棒方法。

Method: 使用定制状态空间模型和AI增强的卡尔曼滤波器KalmanNet，从数据中学习卡尔曼增益，无需先验噪声协方差知识；结合环路检测器计数和聚合浮动车数据。

Result: 在鹿特丹主干道评估中，Q-Net在均方根误差上比基线方法提升超过60%，能准确跟踪队列形成和消散，并修正aFCD引起的延迟。

Conclusion: Q-Net展示了强大的时空可迁移性，无需昂贵的传感基础设施即可部署，并提出了实时变体，具有集成到动态队列控制系统的潜力。

Abstract: Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in
traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where
vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a
data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that
performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated.
Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i)
vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated
floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and
provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often
differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net
addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented
Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without
requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We
build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality
from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments.
Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with
internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main
roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms
baseline methods by over 60\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately
tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays.
Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling
deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar.
Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its
potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型存在模态对齐不充分的问题，某些模态可能未被有效对齐，导致模型在下游任务中无法充分利用多模态信息。

Method: TRIANGLE：基于三角形面积的相似度度量，在模态嵌入的高维空间中直接计算，替代对比损失中的余弦相似度。

Conclusion: TRIANGLE通过几何学习方法有效改善多模态对齐，在多种任务中达到最先进性能，同时提供可解释的对齐依据。

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence
systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more
comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art
models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful
development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide
indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a
result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of
the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide
additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we
present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed
similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space
spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of
three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion
layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses
replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of
multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales.
Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text
retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves
state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of
cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的离线数据集和在线交互往往存在噪声甚至恶意污染，这会严重降低离线到在线强化学习(O2O RL)的性能。现有工作主要关注通过在线探索缓解离线策略的保守性，而数据污染(包括状态、动作、奖励和动态)下的O2O RL鲁棒性尚未被探索。

Method: 提出RPEX方法，将逆概率加权(IPW)融入在线探索策略，以缓解数据污染导致的策略重尾行为。该方法简单而有效。

Result: 在D4RL数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，RPEX在各种数据污染场景下实现了最先进的O2O性能。

Conclusion: RPEX通过逆概率加权成功解决了数据污染导致的策略重尾问题，显著提升了离线到在线强化学习在污染环境中的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online
interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has
emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both
offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often
noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O
RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline
policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data
corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still
unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed
behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of
online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability
Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate
heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed
$\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion.
Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves
SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios. Code is

Method: 使用摊销推理和上下文学习，在广泛的Hawkes过程分布上预训练深度神经网络，通过事件序列上下文推断条件强度函数。

Result: 实验表明，这种摊销方法在常见基准数据集上的下一事件预测性能与专门模型相当。

Conclusion: FIM-PP模型能够实现通用的事件序列建模，无需为每个系统单独训练，展示了基础模型在点过程推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Modeling event sequences of multiple event types with marked temporal point
processes (MTPPs) provides a principled way to uncover governing dynamical
rules and predict future events. Current neural network approaches to MTPP
inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system.
We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and
in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context,
the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined
by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic
dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once
pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can
estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be
rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized
approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction
across common benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 图结构在幻觉检测中发挥重要作用，结合计算痕迹具有显著优势，CHARM方法展现出有前景的零样本性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content,
known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or
simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or
attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed
graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry
features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts
hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying
GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes
prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently
outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results
shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the
benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits
promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.

Conclusion: MSM Emulators框架有效，MarS-FM在蛋白质结构多样性测试中表现优异，具有良好泛化能力

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing
protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long
timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address
this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate
trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag
transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but
uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM
Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states
defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class
with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two
orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD
simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through
structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary
structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues)
with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events,
and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to
assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing
methods, often by a substantial margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洲电网向可再生能源转型，但风能和太阳能的天气依赖性对电网稳定性构成挑战，特别是Dunkelflaute事件可能导致电力供应短缺。

Method: 采用生成式深度学习框架降尺度CMIP6气候模拟，并与ERA5历史数据进行比较，评估德国未来Dunkelflaute事件的发生情况。

Result: 在乐观的低排放（SSP2-4.5）和高排放（SSP5-8.5）情景下，德国Dunkelflaute事件的频率和持续时间在集合平均中与历史时期相比基本不变。

Conclusion: 在所考虑的气候情景下，德国Dunkelflaute事件相关的风险预计在本世纪内保持稳定。

Abstract: The European electricity power grid is transitioning towards renewable energy
sources, characterized by an increasing share of off- and onshore wind and
solar power. However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a
challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of
low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their
potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate
the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years
and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative
deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6
ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from
ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future
occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low
(SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that
both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the
ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the
historical period. This suggests that, under the considered climate scenarios,
the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather,
traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series
forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches
primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging
to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional
methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require
pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed
seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive
Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the
limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining
EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing
seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale
adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four
parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner,
enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A
dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately
process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function
minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine
datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also
exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer
scenarios.

Abstract: A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample
inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive
environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates
this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate
synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world
models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects
and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally
inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly
influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we
introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic
modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich
the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived
from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level
motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic
categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model
(RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments
demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k
benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new
record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\%
performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark. Our code is
released at https://github.com/Ultraman-Tiga1/DyMoDreamer.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the
measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information
for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation
models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations
directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and
clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction
heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to
capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce
Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles
into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level
embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language
models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity,
tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to
unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification
accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based
similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation.
These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language
offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable
outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of
unseen cells.

Abstract: The advent of digital streaming platforms have recently revolutionized the
landscape of music industry, with the ensuing digitalization providing
structured data collections that open new research avenues for investigating
popularity dynamics and mainstream success. The present work explored which
determinants hold the strongest predictive influence for a track's inclusion in
the Billboard Hot 100 charts, including streaming popularity, measurable audio
signal attributes, and probabilistic indicators of human listening. The
analysis revealed that popularity was by far the most decisive predictor of
Billboard Hot 100 inclusion, with considerable contribution from
instrumentalness, valence, duration and speechiness. Logistic Regression
achieved 90.0% accuracy, with very high recall for charting singles (0.986) but
lower recall for non-charting ones (0.813), yielding balanced F1-scores around
0.90. Random Forest slightly improved performance to 90.4% accuracy,
maintaining near-perfect precision for non-charting singles (0.990) and high
recall for charting ones (0.992), with F1-scores up to 0.91. Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) reached 90.3% accuracy, delivering a more balanced trade-off by
improving recall for non-charting singles (0.837) while sustaining high recall
for charting ones (0.969), resulting in F1-scores comparable to the other
models.

*Jiayi Li,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT-Net提出了一种双分支网络架构，通过谱分支和图像分支分别处理全局低频信息和局部高频细节，解决了现有PDE基础模型中全局耦合弱化的问题，显著提升了精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PDE基础模型主要采用多尺度窗口自注意力机制，但由于其局部性，真正的全局谱耦合只能通过深度堆叠和窗口移动逐渐传播，这削弱了全局耦合，导致闭环推演中的误差累积和漂移。

Method: 采用双分支设计：谱分支负责捕获全局大尺度低频信息，图像分支关注局部细节和非平稳结构。通过可控的轻量级低频混合和带权融合，避免简单拼接导致的宽度膨胀和训练不稳定。

Result: 在Navier-Stokes基准测试中，相对L1误差降低7%-54%，参数数量减少约15%，吞吐量仍高于scOT基线。消融研究和理论分析进一步验证了设计的稳定性和有效性。

Conclusion: DRIFT-Net通过谱-图像双分支架构有效解决了PDE神经网络求解器中全局耦合弱化的问题，在保持高吞吐量的同时显著提升了精度并减少了参数数量。

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics with neural solvers can significantly improve
wall-clock efficiency and accuracy compared with classical numerical solvers.
In recent years, foundation models for PDEs have largely adopted multi-scale
windowed self-attention, with the scOT backbone in \textsc{Poseidon} serving as
a representative example.
  However, because of their locality, truly globally consistent spectral
coupling can only be propagated gradually through deep stacking and window
shifting. This weakens global coupling and leads to error accumulation and
drift during closed-loop rollouts. To address this, we propose
\textbf{DRIFT-Net}. It employs a dual-branch design comprising a spectral
branch and an image branch. The spectral branch is responsible for capturing
global, large-scale low-frequency information, whereas the image branch focuses
on local details and nonstationary structures. Specifically, we first perform
controlled, lightweight mixing within the low-frequency range. Then we fuse the
spectral and image paths at each layer via bandwise weighting, which avoids the
width inflation and training instability caused by naive concatenation. The
fused result is transformed back into the spatial domain and added to the image
branch, thereby preserving both global structure and high-frequency details
across scales. Compared with strong attention-based baselines, DRIFT-Net
achieves lower error and higher throughput with fewer parameters under
identical training settings and budget. On Navier--Stokes benchmarks, the
relative $L_{1}$ error is reduced by 7\%--54\%, the parameter count decreases
by about 15\%, and the throughput remains higher than scOT. Ablation studies
and theoretical analyses further demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of
this design. The code is available at

Conclusion: 保形预测能够有效提升SoilNet模型在人类协作标注环境中的效率，特别是在回归任务中表现显著

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential in human-machine collaboration, as
human agents tend to adjust their decisions based on the confidence of the
machine counterpart. Reliably calibrated model uncertainties, hence, enable
more effective collaboration, targeted expert intervention and more responsible
usage of Machine Learning (ML) systems. Conformal prediction has become a well
established model-agnostic framework for uncertainty calibration of ML models,
offering statistically valid confidence estimates for both regression and
classification tasks. In this work, we apply conformal prediction to
$\textit{SoilNet}$, a multimodal multitask model for describing soil profiles.
We design a simulated human-in-the-loop (HIL) annotation pipeline, where a
limited budget for obtaining ground truth annotations from domain experts is
available when model uncertainty is high. Our experiments show that
conformalizing SoilNet leads to more efficient annotation in regression tasks
and comparable performance scores in classification tasks under the same
annotation budget when tested against its non-conformal counterpart. All code

Conclusion: 自适应规范化是解决等变机器学习中不连续性问题的有效框架，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性。

Abstract: Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning,
enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form.
Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during
training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation
theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \emph{adaptive
canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends
both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive
canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the
input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove
that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that
admit universal approximation properties.
  We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis
ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational
symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular
and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our
adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to
equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and
equivariant architectures.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了蛋白质语言模型(PLMs)如何转换序列空间，使用SRV表示和图过滤方法研究PLMs编码蛋白质结构信息的方式，发现PLMs优先编码残基间的局部关系，最忠实结构编码出现在模型接近最后一层的层中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解PLMs如何将整个序列空间及其关系进行转换，以及这些模型中编码的信息，目前仍不完全清楚。现有解释工具主要关注单个序列的转换，缺乏对整体序列空间转换的理解。

Method: 使用平方根速度(SRV)表示和图过滤方法，将蛋白质结构和表示转化为度量空间，分析ESM2模型中不同层的Karcher均值和有效维度，以及模型编码结构特征的上下文长度。

Result: SRV形状空间的Karcher均值和有效维度随模型层数呈现非线性模式；PLMs优先编码残基间的即时和局部关系，但在较大上下文长度下性能下降；最忠实结构编码出现在接近但早于最后一层的层中。

Conclusion: 在PLMs接近最后一层的层上训练折叠模型可能会提高折叠性能，因为该位置编码了最忠实的结构信息。

Abstract: While protein language models (PLMs) are one of the most promising avenues of
research for future de novo protein design, the way in which they transform
sequences to hidden representations, as well as the information encoded in such
representations is yet to be fully understood. Several works have attempted to
propose interpretability tools for PLMs, but they have focused on understanding
how individual sequences are transformed by such models. Therefore, the way in
which PLMs transform the whole space of sequences along with their relations is
still unknown. In this work we attempt to understand this transformed space of
sequences by identifying protein structure and representation with square-root
velocity (SRV) representations and graph filtrations. Both approaches naturally
lead to a metric space in which pairs of proteins or protein representations
can be compared with each other.
  We analyze different types of proteins from the SCOP dataset and show that
the Karcher mean and effective dimension of the SRV shape space follow a
non-linear pattern as a function of the layers in ESM2 models of different
sizes. Furthermore, we use graph filtrations as a tool to study the context
lengths at which models encode the structural features of proteins. We find
that PLMs preferentially encode immediate as well as local relations between
residues, but start to degrade for larger context lengths. The most
structurally faithful encoding tends to occur close to, but before the last
layer of the models, indicating that training a folding model ontop of these
layers might lead to improved folding performance.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型有潜力成为自主智能体，但它们在序列决策中往往探索不足。研究旨在通过SFT和RL方法提升LLMs的探索能力，并理解这些方法如何塑造探索策略及其泛化性能。

Method: 使用专家轨迹进行监督微调(SFT)，以及使用定制奖励信号进行强化学习(RL)，包括策略性的遗憾形状奖励以减少方差，以及算法奖励以实现oracle模仿。

Result: 训练后的智能体表现优于预训练模型，性能接近UCB和Thompson采样，在6倍更长的时间跨度和不同老虎机家族中展现出稳健的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RL/SFT智能体往往采用更复杂但更贪婪的利用策略，容易过早放弃探索。模仿UCB的智能体甚至能超越其教师模型。研究建议需要定制奖励设计和超越平均遗憾的评估来促进稳健的探索行为。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents,
they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has
sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or
reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit
task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration
strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by
training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored
reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,
and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents
outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x
longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that
gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT
agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,
prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB
learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our
findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate
tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust
exploratory behavior.

Motivation: 抗体治疗特性优化通常迭代且昂贵，贝叶斯优化是自然选择。但目前缺乏将结构信息整合到抗体贝叶斯优化中的研究，且不同特性可能需要不同的代理模型。

Method: 比较了整合结构信息的不同方法与仅使用序列的方法，在抗体结合亲和力和稳定性两个特性上进行测试。提出了基于蛋白质语言模型的软约束来引导优化到有前景的区域。

Result: 某些结构信息在稳定性优化的早期阶段提高了数据效率，但峰值性能相同。引入蛋白质语言模型软约束后，亲和力和稳定性的数据效率差距减小甚至消除，序列方法可以达到与结构方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在贝叶斯优化中，序列方法配合蛋白质语言模型软约束可以达到与结构方法相当的性能，对结构信息在抗体贝叶斯优化中的必要性提出了质疑。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody
therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However,
finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly
structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the
property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior
works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody
Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to
incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare
them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody
properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of
a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the
optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of
structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for
stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating
the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap
is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in
sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods,
raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for
antibodies.

Abstract: As a powerful technique in generative modeling, Flow Matching (FM) aims to
learn velocity fields from noise to data, which is often explained and
implemented as solving Optimal Transport (OT) problems. In this study, we
bridge FM and the recent theory of Optimal Acceleration Transport (OAT),
developing an improved FM method called OAT-FM and exploring its benefits in
both theory and practice. In particular, we demonstrate that the straightening
objective hidden in existing OT-based FM methods is mathematically equivalent
to minimizing the physical action associated with acceleration defined by OAT.
Accordingly, instead of enforcing constant velocity, OAT-FM optimizes the
acceleration transport in the product space of sample and velocity, whose
objective corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition of flow
straightness. An efficient algorithm is designed to achieve OAT-FM with low
complexity. OAT-FM motivates a new two-phase FM paradigm: Given a generative
model trained by an arbitrary FM method, whose velocity information has been
relatively reliable, we can fine-tune and improve it via OAT-FM. This paradigm
eliminates the risk of data distribution drift and the need to generate a large
number of noise data pairs, which consistently improves model performance in
various generative tasks. Code is available at:

Conclusion: 通过减少特征相关性，提出的方法能够改善迁移学习效果，为深度强化学习的实际应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex
sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL
framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as
the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs.
Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these
challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for
new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from
scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage
the internal representations learned by the neural network during training.
Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as
refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the
input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used
as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on
new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL
models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used
with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a
novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce
positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging
these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear
function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation
studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby
reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time reasoning
algorithms such as chain-of-thought and multi-branch reasoning to improve
accuracy on complex tasks. These methods, however, substantially increase token
usage and per-request latency. Prior work has largely focused on reducing token
usage, often at the expense of accuracy, while overlooking other latency
factors. We present DUCHESS, an LLM serving system that reduces cost and
latency without sacrificing accuracy through intra-request branch orchestration
guided by predictions. DUCHESS employs a lightweight linear probing model over
LLM layer activations to estimate branch correctness, and its orchestration
policy decides whether to terminate, duplicate, or continue a branch. When
handling multiple requests, DUCHESS further reduces latency by prioritizing
easier reasoning tasks when complexity can be estimated from the prompt.
Experiments on three reasoning benchmarks show that DUCHESS consistently

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较离散扩散模型和自回归模型在样本效率上的差异，发现自回归模型在小数据集上更高效，而离散扩散模型需要更大容量和计算才能达到竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据稀缺促使需要更高效的样本利用，通过双下降现象全面比较离散扩散和自回归模型的样本效率。

Method: 使用双下降现象来系统比较离散扩散模型和自回归模型的样本效率，分析它们在不同参数化程度下的表现。

Result: 离散扩散模型需要更大容量和更多训练轮次才能达到插值阈值，在强过参数化状态下两者表现相似，都没有明显的测试损失二次下降。

Conclusion: 自回归模型在小规模数据集上更样本高效，离散扩散模型只有在获得足够容量和计算时才具有竞争力。

Abstract: Data scarcity drives the need for more sample-efficient large language
models. In this work, we use the double descent phenomenon to holistically
compare the sample efficiency of discrete diffusion and autoregressive models.
We show that discrete diffusion models require larger capacity and more
training epochs to escape their underparameterized regime and reach the
interpolation threshold. In the strongly overparameterized regime, both models
exhibit similar behavior, with neither exhibiting a pronounced second descent
in test loss across a large range of model sizes. Overall, our results indicate
that autoregressive models are more sample-efficient on small-scale datasets,
while discrete diffusion models only become competitive when given sufficient
capacity and compute.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR方法通过可验证奖励提升LLM推理能力，但现有方法存在训练不稳定和多样性崩溃问题。本文提出ROVER算法，利用随机策略的Q函数恢复最优动作，绕过了复杂的策略迭代循环，在数学推理任务中取得了更好的质量和多样性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于PPO和GRPO的RLVR方法虽然有效，但存在训练不稳定、多样性崩溃问题，需要复杂的启发式技巧和精细调参。作者发现数学推理中的RLVR可以形式化为具有确定性状态转移、树状结构和二元终端奖励的特殊MDP，其结构比通用RL设置更简单，因此可以简化现有方法的复杂技术。

Method: 提出ROVER算法，基于一个关键发现：最优动作可以从固定均匀随机策略的Q函数中恢复。该方法绕过了传统的策略迭代循环，通过采样基于这些均匀策略Q值的softmax分布来生成动作，保持了训练过程中的多样性。

Result: 在多个基础模型和标准数学推理基准测试中，ROVER在质量（pass@1提升8.2，pass@256提升16.8）和多样性（提升17.6%）方面都表现出色，尽管相比现有复杂方法进行了大幅简化。

Conclusion: ROVER证明了在数学推理等特定RLVR任务中，可以绕过复杂的策略迭代过程，通过简单的随机策略评估获得优异性能，同时保持解决方案的多样性，为LLM推理训练提供了更简洁有效的替代方案。

Abstract: RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current
methods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO,
which follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating
the current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While
effective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse,
requiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard
RLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov
Decision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured
dynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying
structure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated
techniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this
insight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from
the Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the
generalized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce
Random Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this
principle into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a
minimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax
over these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout
training, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across
multiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates
superior performance in both \textbf{quality} (\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1,
\textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \textbf{diversity} (\textbf{+17.6\%}), despite
its radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.

*Lu Zou,Wendi Ren,Weizhong Zhang,Liang Ding,Shuang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从函数空间视角重新审视PPO算法，在再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)中解耦策略评估和改进：使用核化TD评论家进行高效梯度更新，KL正则化的自然梯度策略步恢复PPO/TRPO风格的近端更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为PPO算法提供更坚实的理论基础，超越有限维假设，阐明RKHS近端更新与核TD评论家在何时能实现全局策略改进并保持实际效率。

Method: 在RKHS中解耦策略评估和改进：(i) 核化TD评论家使用单步状态-动作转移样本进行高效RKHS梯度更新；(ii) KL正则化的自然梯度策略步对评估的动作值进行指数化，恢复连续状态-动作空间中的PPO/TRPO风格近端更新。

Result: 提供了非渐近、实例自适应的理论保证，收敛速率取决于RKHS熵，统一了表格、线性、Sobolev、高斯和神经正切核(NTK)等机制。经验上，理论对齐的调度提高了常见控制任务(如CartPole、Acrobot)的稳定性和样本效率，TD评论家在吞吐量上优于GAE基线。

Conclusion: 研究结果将PPO置于更坚实的理论基础上，阐明了RKHS近端更新与核TD评论家能够实现全局策略改进并保持实际效率的条件。

Abstract: We revisit Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from a function-space
perspective. Our analysis decouples policy evaluation and improvement in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS): (i) A kernelized temporal-difference
(TD) critic performs efficient RKHS-gradient updates using only one-step
state-action transition samples; (ii) a KL-regularized, natural-gradient policy
step exponentiates the evaluated action-value, recovering a PPO/TRPO-style
proximal update in continuous state-action spaces. We provide non-asymptotic,
instance-adaptive guarantees whose rates depend on RKHS entropy, unifying
tabular, linear, Sobolev, Gaussian, and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regimes,
and we derive a sampling rule for the proximal update that ensures the optimal
$k^{-1/2}$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. Empirically, the
theory-aligned schedule improves stability and sample efficiency on common
control tasks (e.g., CartPole, Acrobot), while our TD-based critic attains
favorable throughput versus a GAE baseline. Altogether, our results place PPO
on a firmer theoretical footing beyond finite-dimensional assumptions and
clarify when RKHS-proximal updates with kernel-TD critics yield global policy
improvement with practical efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了SimA，一种针对扩散模型的单查询成员推理攻击方法，通过分析去噪器输出的范数来检测训练样本的成员身份，发现潜在扩散模型比像素空间模型更不易受攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型可能无意中泄露训练数据集的成员信息，引发严重的隐私担忧，需要研究有效的成员推理攻击方法。

Method: 基于理论分析发现去噪器输出指向训练样本的局部均值，其范数编码了与训练集的接近程度。据此提出SimA单查询攻击，替代现有的多查询方法。

Result: SimA在DDPM和潜在扩散模型变体上表现一致强劲。潜在扩散模型由于潜在自编码器的强信息瓶颈而相对更安全。通过调整β-VAE的正则化超参数，提出了增强LDM训练鲁棒性的策略。

Conclusion: 研究巩固了基于分数的成员推理攻击理论，同时强调需要更好地理解VAE的反转而不仅仅是扩散过程的反转。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as
a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a
given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and
empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors
that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser
output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples,
such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals
membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query
attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing
multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across
variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent
Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due
to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We
further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters
($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM
training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based
MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better
understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion
process

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知深度学习框架，用于改进短期野火危险预测，通过联合建模认知不确定性和偶然不确定性来提高预测准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野火是严重的自然灾害，深度学习在野火预测中表现出潜力，但由于缺乏不确定性量化，其可靠性受到质疑，阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 开发了不确定性感知深度学习框架，同时捕捉认知不确定性（模型不确定性）和偶然不确定性（数据不确定性），用于短期野火危险预测。

Result: 在次日预测中，最佳模型相比确定性基线将F1分数提高了2.3%，预期校准误差降低了2.1%。不确定性估计可靠，可用于决策支持，包括识别不确定性阈值以拒绝低置信度预测，并生成带有不确定性层的校准野火危险地图。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了野火危险预测的准确性和可靠性，推进了可信赖野火深度学习系统的发展。两种不确定性类型在低不确定性情况下可能冗余，但在更具挑战性的条件下提供互补见解。

Abstract: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant
threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires
increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also
reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger;
however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its
predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To
address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that
jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance
short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our
best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected
Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both
predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of
the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision
support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting
low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire
danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast
horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with
time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic
uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty
types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary
insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their
joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach
significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger
forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARCOS提出了一种新的LLM推理范式，将推理建模为连续高维思想的隐马尔可夫链，替代传统的token级链式思维推理，实现了更高效和灵活的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统链式思维推理存在三个主要问题：推理速度慢且计算成本高、推理受限于离散token空间、推理与token生成耦合导致短视推理。

Method: 将推理建模为隐藏的连续思想马尔可夫链，显式推理步骤作为可观测变量，采用两阶段变分训练方案解决潜在过程与监督学习的不兼容问题。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MARCOS性能达到token级链式思维推理水平，在GSM8K上甚至超越4.7%，推理速度提升最高达15.7倍。

Conclusion: MARCOS为LLM推理提供了新的连续推理范式，支持步骤级而非token级的随机性控制，为强化学习和推理开辟了新机会。

Abstract: The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves
models "thinking out loud" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought
(CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.
Firstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT
tokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains
reasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck
across reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with
token generation, forcing LLMs to "think while speaking," which causes
potentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we
re-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our
approach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as
a hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional "thoughts". Each
reasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit
reasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable
variables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this
latent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we
further propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on
three benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous
reasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to
token-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup
in inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as
step-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant
opportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.

Result: 模型能够准确高效地估计高保真结构分析结果，在铁路下穿桥案例中证明可显著降低成本和排放。

Conclusion: 该框架能够快速识别关键结构，为需要精细分析的情况提供指导，避免不必要的分析和物理干预。

Abstract: Aging infrastructure portfolios pose a critical resource allocation
challenge: deciding which structures require intervention and which can safely
remain in service. Structural assessments must balance the trade-off between
cheaper, conservative analysis methods and accurate but costly simulations that
do not scale portfolio-wide. We propose Bayesian neural network (BNN)
surrogates for rapid structural pre-assessment of worldwide common bridge
types, such as reinforced concrete frame bridges. Trained on a large-scale
database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric
pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio,
the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural
analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated
epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware
triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where
refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in
a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to
significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and
physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着超参数调优在大规模应用中成本越来越高，需要建立高效的调优原则，但目前这类原则仍然有限。

Method: 通过研究预训练损失曲线、梯度噪声和梯度范数，发现它们相对于学习率和权重衰减组合量表现出不变性现象。

Result: 识别出轨迹不变性现象，将二维超参数空间简化为一维，提出了沿着轨迹不变性揭示的显著方向进行调优的高效规则。

Conclusion: 本工作提出了新的高效调优原则，改进了之前的缩放定律，并对现有观点提出了挑战，为缩放定律的未来研究提供了启发。

Abstract: As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient
tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning
remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by
considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning
rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance,
where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit
invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines
learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the
original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an
efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory
invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several
existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient
tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.

TL;DR: 提出了Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)方法，将扩散模型的预训练目标与RL目标统一，通过优势加权降低方差并加速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型RL方法（如DDPO）使用与预训练不同的目标函数，导致方差增加和收敛缓慢。本文旨在统一预训练和RL目标。

Method: AWM使用与预训练相同的score/flow-matching损失，但通过优势函数对样本进行重新加权，提升高奖励样本的影响。

Result: 在GenEval、OCR和PickScore基准测试中，AWM相比Flow-GRPO实现了高达24倍的加速，且不损害生成质量。

Conclusion: AWM通过统一预训练和RL目标，在理论和实践上都取得了显著改进，为扩散模型的强化学习提供了更有效的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), where pre-training and RL post-training share the
same log-likelihood formulation. In contrast, recent RL approaches for
diffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO),
optimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow
matching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is
an implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases
variance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce
\textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for
diffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a
lower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage. In effect,
AWM raises the influence of high-reward samples and suppresses low-reward ones
while keeping the modeling objective identical to pretraining. This unifies
pretraining and RL conceptually and practically, is consistent with
policy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and yields faster convergence. This
simple yet effective design yields substantial benefits: on GenEval, OCR, and
PickScore benchmarks, AWM delivers up to a $24\times$ speedup over Flow-GRPO
(which builds on DDPO), when applied to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX,
without compromising generation quality. Code is available at

Abstract: Data-driven models are increasingly adopted in critical scientific fields
like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. These methods can fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks
is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating
joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers
not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a
task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including
PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this
likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a
foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby
offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based
scientific predictions. Our code is publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在实用缩放配方（联合缩放宽度、深度、学习率、批量大小和权重衰减）下训练的LLM家族中，损失曲线坍缩现象是否仍然存在。

Method: 通过分析不同规模模型在最优超参数设置下的训练损失曲线，验证坍缩现象的出现条件，并应用于训练病理诊断和超参数调优的早期停止。

Result: 当优化超参数根据数据预算最优设置时，损失曲线在不同规模间精确坍缩，坍缩现象成为计算高效训练的标志。

Conclusion: 坍缩现象是开发高效LLM的有效工具，通过训练Celerity LLM家族验证了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities
-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across
model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends
beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal
trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this
phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,
where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled
jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely
when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,
in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a
signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at
scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of
training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables
early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a
competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse
as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

Unlike standard CoT distillation, the approach transfers knowledge through

outputs, outperforming both off- and on-policy alternatives. Experiments on

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够训练实验引导模型，在动态实验条件下提供实时反馈。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography is a data-intensive imaging technique expected to become
ubiquitous at next-generation light sources delivering many-fold increases in
coherent flux. The need for real-time feedback under accelerated acquisition
rates motivates surrogate reconstruction models like deep neural networks,
which offer orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional methods. However,
existing deep learning approaches lack robustness across diverse experimental
conditions. We propose an unsupervised training workflow emphasizing probe
learning by combining experimentally-measured probes with synthetic,
procedurally generated objects. This probe-centric approach enables a single
physics-informed neural network to reconstruct unseen experiments across
multiple beamlines; among the first demonstrations of multi-probe
generalization. We find probe learning is equally important as in-distribution
learning; models trained using this synthetic workflow achieve reconstruction
fidelity comparable to those trained exclusively on experimental data, even
when changing the type of synthetic training object. The proposed approach
enables training of experiment-steering models that provide real-time feedback
under dynamic experimental conditions.

it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.
Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in
the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of
LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space
and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion
as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To
address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method
that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN
achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a
top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed
into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical
benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous
entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on
AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes
greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which
helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively
mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

*David González Martínez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BALF是一个无需微调的神经网络压缩框架，通过激活感知因子分解和可扩展的预算秩分配器，实现灵活控制压缩目标，在多种模型和数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络压缩技术需要昂贵的微调或搜索过程，使其在普通硬件上不实用，因此需要开发无需微调的高效压缩方法。

Method: 提出激活感知因子分解框架和可扩展预算秩分配器，形成BALF压缩流水线，可应用于多种层类型，灵活控制压缩目标。

Result: 在ResNet-20、ResNeXt-101和视觉变换器等多种模型上验证，ResNeXt-101的FLOPs减少45%时仅导致top-1准确率下降1个百分点。

Conclusion: BALF在无需微调的情况下实现了高效的模型压缩，在多种架构和规模上都取得了优异结果。

Abstract: Neural network compression techniques typically require expensive fine-tuning
or search procedures, rendering them impractical on commodity hardware.
Inspired by recent LLM compression research, we present a general
activation-aware factorization framework that can be applied to a broad range
of layers. Moreover, we introduce a scalable budgeted rank allocator that
allows flexible control over compression targets (e.g., retaining 50% of
parameters) with no overhead. Together, these components form BALF, an
efficient pipeline for compressing models without fine-tuning. We demonstrate
its effectiveness across multiple scales and architectures, from ResNet-20 on
CIFAR-10 to ResNeXt-101 and vision transformers on ImageNet, and show that it
achieves excellent results in the fine-tuning-free regime. For instance, BALF
reduces FLOPs on ResNeXt-101 by 45% with only a 1-percentage-point top-1
accuracy drop.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的方法CCFM，将随机优化集成到采样过程中，在保持高保真样本生成的同时有效执行硬约束


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型虽然能合成高质量样本，但经常违反物理定律或任务规范中的硬约束。现有投影方法会扭曲学习分布，而多阶段方法会增加算法复杂度和误差积累

Method: CCFM方法将随机优化集成到采样过程中，直接在噪声中间样本上操作，但理论上等效于在干净样本上投影到可行集

Result: 实验表明CCFM在建模复杂物理系统和分子对接问题中优于当前最先进的约束生成模型，提供更高的可行性和保真度

Conclusion: CCFM能够在保证可行性的同时减轻分布扭曲，为约束生成问题提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: Generative models excel at synthesizing high-fidelity samples from complex
data distributions, but they often violate hard constraints arising from
physical laws or task specifications. A common remedy is to project
intermediate samples onto the feasible set; however, repeated projection can
distort the learned distribution and induce a mismatch with the data manifold.
Thus, recent multi-stage procedures attempt to defer projection to clean
samples during sampling, but they increase algorithmic complexity and
accumulate errors across steps. This paper addresses these challenges by
proposing a novel training-free method, Chance-constrained Flow Matching
(CCFM), that integrates stochastic optimization into the sampling process,
enabling effective enforcement of hard constraints while maintaining
high-fidelity sample generation. Importantly, CCFM guarantees feasibility in
the same manner as conventional repeated projection, yet, despite operating
directly on noisy intermediate samples, it is theoretically equivalent to
projecting onto the feasible set defined by clean samples. This yields a
sampler that mitigates distributional distortion. Empirical experiments show
that CCFM outperforms current state-of-the-art constrained generative models in
modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations
and molecular docking problems, delivering higher feasibility and fidelity.

Motivation: 现有的基于随机最优控制的强化学习方法在扩散模型微调中容易强化次优轨迹，导致奖励不佳。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建重放缓冲区，然后在随机最优控制目标下微调预训练的离散扩散模型。

Result: 在生物序列扩散模型的单目标和多目标微调任务中验证了TR2-D2的有效性。

Conclusion: TR2-D2为离散序列生成中的奖励引导微调提供了可靠的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising
framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is
optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While
these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from
the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current
fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal
trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce
TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion
(TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion
trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware
fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under
a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single-
and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models,
highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided
fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.

Conclusion: 优化感知的架构设计能显著提升样本效率，XQC算法验证了通过改善优化景观而非增加复杂度来提升性能的有效性。

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a central property of effective deep reinforcement
learning algorithms. Recent work has improved this through added complexity,
such as larger models, exotic network architectures, and more complex
algorithms, which are typically motivated purely by empirical performance. We
take a more principled approach by focusing on the optimization landscape of
the critic network. Using the eigenspectrum and condition number of the
critic's Hessian, we systematically investigate the impact of common
architectural design decisions on training dynamics. Our analysis reveals that
a novel combination of batch normalization (BN), weight normalization (WN), and
a distributional cross-entropy (CE) loss produces condition numbers orders of
magnitude smaller than baselines. This combination also naturally bounds
gradient norms, a property critical for maintaining a stable effective learning
rate under non-stationary targets and bootstrapping. Based on these insights,
we introduce XQC: a well-motivated, sample-efficient deep actor-critic
algorithm built upon soft actor-critic that embodies these optimization-aware
principles. We achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency across 55
proprioception and 15 vision-based continuous control tasks, all while using
significantly fewer parameters than competing methods.

TL;DR: SIRI是一种用于大型推理模型的高效强化学习方法，通过交替压缩和扩展推理预算来提升推理效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现大型推理模型存在重复思维模式，减少这些模式往往以性能为代价。本文旨在克服这种权衡。

Method: 采用训练机制，在压缩阶段减少推理步长迫使模型在有限上下文中做出精确决策，在扩展阶段放宽长度限制让模型探索长时程设置。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上训练，SIRI-low在AIME24上性能提升43.2%同时减少46.9%的token使用，SIRI-high达到最高准确率。

Conclusion: 周期性调整推理模型的输出截断长度可以在训练中动态平衡探索和效率，收敛到两者之间的最优平衡点。

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved
Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies
have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them
often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates
between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically
adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase
cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable
decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens
and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length
limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon
settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the
model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily
pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency
trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves
performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three
iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other
methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically
oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically
balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal
"sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.

TL;DR: VB-Score是一个无监督评估框架，通过测量系统在多种可能解释下的表现方差来评估有效性和鲁棒性，无需真实标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于标签的评估方法在任务缺乏真实标签或存在歧义时失效，无法评估系统在不确定解释下的鲁棒性。

Method: VB-Score枚举查询的合理解释，分配概率，通过期望成功减去方差来评估输出，奖励跨意图的一致性能。

Result: 实验表明VB-Score能揭示传统指标隐藏的鲁棒性差异，在歧义查询和实体检索任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: VB-Score为在歧义或标签稀缺领域评估机器学习系统提供了理论基础，支持可重复的无标签评估。

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is a central challenge in machine learning when tasks
lack ground truth labels or involve ambiguity and noise. Conventional
frameworks, rooted in the Cranfield paradigm and label-based metrics, fail in
such cases because they cannot assess how robustly a system performs under
uncertain interpretations. We introduce VB-Score, a variance-bounded evaluation
framework that measures both effectiveness and robustness without requiring
ground truth. Given a query or input, VB-Score enumerates plausible
interpretations, assigns probabilities, and evaluates output by expected
success penalized by variance, rewarding consistent performance across intents.
We provide a formal analysis of VB-Score, establishing range, monotonicity, and
stability properties, and relate it to risk-sensitive measures such as
mean-variance utility. Experiments on ambiguous queries and entity-centric
retrieval tasks show that VB-Score surfaces robustness differences hidden by
conventional metrics. By enabling reproducible, label-free evaluation, VB-Score
offers a principled foundation for benchmarking machine learning systems in
ambiguous or label-scarce domains.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文从概率角度分析概念激活向量(CAVs)，揭示了CAVs对非概念分布的依赖性和潜在脆弱性，提出了一个简单的对抗攻击来证明这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAV方法缺乏对非概念分布影响的系统性研究，作者希望通过概率视角揭示CAVs的潜在脆弱性。

Method: 采用概率视角，将CAVs视为随机向量，推导不同类型CAVs的均值和协方差，并设计简单有效的对抗攻击来验证理论发现。

Result: 研究发现CAVs强烈依赖于任意选择的非概念分布，这一因素在先前工作中被忽视，通过对抗攻击证实了这种依赖性。

Conclusion: 需要对CAVs进行更系统的研究，特别是关注非概念分布的影响，以提高解释性AI工具的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are a tool from explainable AI, offering a
promising approach for understanding how human-understandable concepts are
encoded in a model's latent spaces. They are computed from hidden-layer
activations of inputs belonging either to a concept class or to non-concept
examples. Adopting a probabilistic perspective, the distribution of the
(non-)concept inputs induces a distribution over the CAV, making it a random
vector in the latent space. This enables us to derive mean and covariance for
different types of CAVs, leading to a unified theoretical view. This
probabilistic perspective also reveals a potential vulnerability: CAVs can
strongly depend on the rather arbitrary non-concept distribution, a factor
largely overlooked in prior work. We illustrate this with a simple yet
effective adversarial attack, underscoring the need for a more systematic
study.

Motivation: 分数阶模型能够捕捉疾病进展、潜伏和恢复过程中的长程记忆效应，扩展了经典的整数阶模型，为分析非马尔可夫流行病过程提供了新工具。

Method: 通过L1离散化方案将Caputo分数阶导数嵌入网络残差，使用包含数据失配、物理残差和初始条件的复合损失函数，同时学习分数记忆阶数α和流行病学参数(β, σ, γ, μ)。

Result: 在合成Mpox数据测试中可靠地恢复了α和参数，在COVID-19应用中显示最优α∈(0,1]能够捕捉记忆效应并提高预测性能，优于经典SEIRD模型。

Conclusion: 该工作确立了PINN作为学习流行病动态中记忆效应的强大工具，对预测、控制策略和非马尔可夫流行病过程分析具有重要意义。

Abstract: We develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for parameter
estimation in fractional-order SEIRD epidemic models. By embedding the Caputo
fractional derivative into the network residuals via the L1 discretization
scheme, our method simultaneously reconstructs epidemic trajectories and infers
both epidemiological parameters and the fractional memory order $\alpha$. The
fractional formulation extends classical integer-order models by capturing
long-range memory effects in disease progression, incubation, and recovery. Our
framework learns the fractional memory order $\alpha$ as a trainable parameter
while simultaneously estimating the epidemiological rates $(\beta, \sigma,
\gamma, \mu)$. A composite loss combining data misfit, physics residuals, and
initial conditions, with constraints on positivity and population conservation,
ensures both accuracy and biological consistency. Tests on synthetic Mpox data
confirm reliable recovery of $\alpha$ and parameters under noise, while
applications to COVID-19 show that optimal $\alpha \in (0, 1]$ captures memory
effects and improves predictive performance over the classical SEIRD model.
This work establishes PINNs as a robust tool for learning memory effects in
epidemic dynamics, with implications for forecasting, control strategies, and
the analysis of non-Markovian epidemic processes.

Motivation: 从噪声成对比较中恢复全局排名是许多实际应用中的关键问题，需要理论保证和有效算法。

Method: 采用复数数据模型将真实排名编码为单位模向量的相位，使用半定规划松弛方法。

Result: 建立了尖锐的非渐近恢复保证，确定了临界噪声阈值σ=O(√(n/logn))，在此阈值下SyncRank能以高概率实现精确排名恢复。

Conclusion: SyncRank算法在理论分析和实验验证中都表现出色，在不同问题规模和噪声机制下具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: We present a theoretical and empirical analysis of the SyncRank algorithm for
recovering a global ranking from noisy pairwise comparisons. By adopting a
complex-valued data model where the true ranking is encoded in the phases of a
unit-modulus vector, we establish a sharp non-asymptotic recovery guarantee for
the associated semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. Our main theorem
characterizes a critical noise threshold - scaling as sigma = O(sqrt(n / log
n)) - below which SyncRank achieves exact ranking recovery with high
probability. Extensive experiments under this model confirm the theoretical
predictions and demonstrate the algorithm's robustness across varying problem
sizes and noise regimes.

Result: 建立了算法的有限样本收敛率，证明了算法在保护隐私的同时达到一致性，并精确量化了隐私参数、样本量和迭代复杂度之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 这是首个在线性模型工具变量回归中同时提供隐私保证和可证明收敛率的工作，实验验证了方法在实际数据集上的准确性与隐私权衡效果。

Abstract: We study instrumental variable regression (IVaR) under differential privacy
constraints. Classical IVaR methods (like two-stage least squares regression)
rely on solving moment equations that directly use sensitive covariates and
instruments, creating significant risks of privacy leakage and posing
challenges in designing algorithms that are both statistically efficient and
differentially private. We propose a noisy two-state gradient descent algorithm
that ensures $\rho$-zero-concentrated differential privacy by injecting
carefully calibrated noise into the gradient updates. Our analysis establishes
finite-sample convergence rates for the proposed method, showing that the
algorithm achieves consistency while preserving privacy. In particular, we
derive precise bounds quantifying the trade-off among privacy parameters,
sample size, and iteration-complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to provide both privacy guarantees and provable convergence
rates for instrumental variable regression in linear models. We further
validate our theoretical findings with experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets, demonstrating that our method offers practical accuracy-privacy
trade-offs.

Conclusion: 在时间序列分类任务中，利用标签信息进行条件插补可以改善分类性能

Abstract: Missing data is a common problem in time series data. Most methods for
imputation ignore label information pertaining to the time series even if that
information exists. In this paper, we provide a framework for missing data
imputation in the context of time series classification, where each time series
is associated with a categorical label. We define a means of imputing missing
values conditional upon labels, the method being guided by powerful, existing
supervised models designed for high accuracy in this task. From each model, we
extract a tree-based proximity measure from which imputation can be applied. We
show that imputation using this method generally provides richer information
leading to higher classification accuracies, despite the imputed values
differing from the true values.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种灵活的不确定性量化框架，能够反映个体预测的确定性，同时实现所需的覆盖范围。

Abstract: In machine learning, uncertainty quantification helps assess the reliability
of model predictions, which is important in high-stakes scenarios. Traditional
approaches often emphasize predictive accuracy, but there is a growing focus on
incorporating uncertainty measures. This paper addresses localized uncertainty
quantification in random forests. While current methods often rely on quantile
regression or Monte Carlo techniques, we propose a new approach using naturally
occurring test sets and similarity measures (proximities) typically viewed as
byproducts of random forests. Specifically, we form localized distributions of
OOB errors around nearby points, defined using the proximities, to create
prediction intervals for regression and trust scores for classification. By
varying the number of nearby points, our intervals can be adjusted to achieve
the desired coverage while retaining the flexibility that reflects the
certainty of individual predictions. For classification, excluding points
identified as unclassifiable by our method generally enhances the accuracy of
the model and provides higher accuracy-rejection AUC scores than competing
methods.

Abstract: Deploying black-box LLMs requires managing uncertainty in the absence of
token-level probability or true labels. We propose introducing an unsupervised
conformal inference framework for generation, which integrates: generative
models, incorporating: (i) an LLM-compatible atypical score derived from
response-embedding Gram matrix, (ii) UCP combined with a bootstrapping variant
(BB-UCP) that aggregates residuals to refine quantile precision while
maintaining distribution-free, finite-sample coverage, and (iii) conformal
alignment, which calibrates a single strictness parameter $\tau$ so a user
predicate (e.g., factuality lift) holds on unseen batches with probability $\ge
1-\alpha$. Across different benchmark datasets, our gates achieve
close-to-nominal coverage and provide tighter, more stable thresholds than
split UCP, while consistently reducing the severity of hallucination,
outperforming lightweight per-response detectors with similar computational
demands. The result is a label-free, API-compatible gate for test-time
filtering that turns geometric signals into calibrated, goal-aligned decisions.

Conclusion: SDAMI框架成功结合了深度学习的灵活性和可解释性要求，通过效应足迹概念和结构化方法有效平衡了预测精度与模型透明度。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning highlight the need for personalized models
that can learn from small or moderate samples, handle high dimensional
features, and remain interpretable. To address this challenge, we propose the
Sparse Deep Additive Model with Interactions (SDAMI), a framework that combines
sparsity driven feature selection with deep subnetworks for flexible function
approximation. Unlike conventional deep learning models, which often function
as black boxes, SDAMI explicitly disentangles main effects and interaction
effects to enhance interpretability. At the same time, its deep additive
structure achieves higher predictive accuracy than classical additive models.
Central to SDAMI is the concept of an Effect Footprint, which assumes that
higher order interactions project marginally onto main effects. Guided by this
principle, SDAMI adopts a two stage strategy: first, identify strong main
effects that implicitly carry information about important interactions. second,
exploit this information through structured regularization such as group lasso
to distinguish genuine main effects from interaction effects. For each selected
main effect, SDAMI constructs a dedicated subnetwork, enabling nonlinear
function approximation while preserving interpretability and providing a
structured foundation for modeling interactions. Extensive simulations with
comparisons confirm SDAMI$'$s ability to recover effect structures across
diverse scenarios, while applications in reliability analysis, neuroscience,
and medical diagnostics further demonstrate its versatility in addressing
real-world high-dimensional modeling challenges.

gradient boosting remain challenging and under-explored. We propose a unified
framework for statistical inference in gradient boosting regression. Our
framework integrates dropout or parallel training with a recently proposed
regularization procedure that allows for a central limit theorem (CLT) for
boosting. With these enhancements, we surprisingly find that increasing the
dropout rate and the number of trees grown in parallel at each iteration
substantially enhances signal recovery and overall performance. Our resulting
algorithms enjoy similar CLTs, which we use to construct built-in confidence
intervals, prediction intervals, and rigorous hypothesis tests for assessing
variable importance. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
perform well, interpolate between regularized boosting and random forests, and
confirm the validity of their built-in statistical inference procedures.

Abstract: Conditional risk minimization arises in high-stakes decisions where risk must
be assessed in light of side information, such as stressed economic conditions,
specific customer profiles, or other contextual covariates. Constructing
reliable conditional distributions from limited data is notoriously difficult,
motivating a series of optimal-transport-based proposals that address this
uncertainty in a distributionally robust manner. Yet these approaches remain
fragmented, each constrained by its own limitations: some rely on point
estimates or restrictive structural assumptions, others apply only to narrow
classes of risk measures, and their structural connections are unclear. We
introduce a universal framework for distributionally robust conditional risk
minimization, built on a novel union-ball formulation in optimal transport.
This framework offers three key advantages: interpretability, by subsuming
existing methods as special cases and revealing their deep structural links;
tractability, by yielding convex reformulations for virtually all major risk
functionals studied in the literature; and scalability, by supporting
cutting-plane algorithms for large-scale conditional risk problems.
Applications to portfolio optimization with rank-dependent expected utility
highlight the practical effectiveness of the framework, with conditional models
converging to optimal solutions where unconditional ones clearly do not.

Motivation: 图学习方法的有效性依赖于特征异质性，需要能够显式控制这一关键属性的生成框架。

Result: 建立了经验异质性得分的集中性结果，以及特征异质性度量几乎必然收敛到图子度分布的确定性泛函。

Conclusion: 图子和滤波器的相互作用决定了特征异质性的极限水平，为数据建模和生成提供了可调机制。

Abstract: We introduce a principled generative framework for graph signals that enables
explicit control of feature heterophily, a key property underlying the
effectiveness of graph learning methods. Our model combines a Lipschitz
graphon-based random graph generator with Gaussian node features filtered
through a smooth spectral function of the rescaled Laplacian. We establish new
theoretical guarantees: (i) a concentration result for the empirical
heterophily score; and (ii) almost-sure convergence of the feature heterophily
measure to a deterministic functional of the graphon degree profile, based on a
graphon-limit law for polynomial averages of Laplacian eigenvalues. These
results elucidate how the interplay between the graphon and the filter governs
the limiting level of feature heterophily, providing a tunable mechanism for
data modeling and generation. We validate the theory through experiments
demonstrating precise control of homophily across graph families and spectral
filters.

TL;DR: FMCPE是一种基于流匹配的校正后验估计框架，通过两阶段方法解决模拟器与真实数据不匹配的问题，提高推理准确性和不确定性校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模拟推断中模型错误设定的挑战，即模拟器只是现实的近似，模拟数据与真实数据不匹配会导致后验估计偏差或过度自信。

Method: 两阶段方法：首先在大量模拟数据上训练后验近似器；然后使用流匹配将预测结果向真实观测支持的真实后验方向传输，无需明确知道错误设定。

Result: 在合成基准测试和真实数据集上，FMCPE能持续减轻错误设定的影响，相比标准SBI基线提供改进的推理准确性和不确定性校准，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: FMCPE成功地将SBI的可扩展性与对分布偏移的鲁棒性相结合，为模型错误设定问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is transforming experimental sciences by
enabling parameter estimation in complex non-linear models from simulated data.
A persistent challenge, however, is model misspecification: simulators are only
approximations of reality, and mismatches between simulated and real data can
yield biased or overconfident posteriors. We address this issue by introducing
Flow Matching Corrected Posterior Estimation (FMCPE), a framework that
leverages the flow matching paradigm to refine simulation-trained posterior
estimators using a small set of real calibration samples. Our approach proceeds
in two stages: first, a posterior approximator is trained on abundant simulated
data; second, flow matching transports its predictions toward the true
posterior supported by real observations, without requiring explicit knowledge
of the misspecification. This design enables FMCPE to combine the scalability
of SBI with robustness to distributional shift. Across synthetic benchmarks and
real-world datasets, we show that our proposal consistently mitigates the
effects of misspecification, delivering improved inference accuracy and
uncertainty calibration compared to standard SBI baselines, while remaining
computationally efficient.

TL;DR: E2M是一个深度学习框架，用于预测度量空间值的输出，通过加权Fréchet均值进行预测，权重由神经网络根据输入学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现代应用涉及预测结构化、非欧几里得输出（如概率分布、网络和对称正定矩阵），这些输出自然建模为一般度量空间的元素，而依赖向量空间结构的经典回归技术不再适用。

Method: E2M通过加权Fréchet均值进行预测，权重由神经网络根据输入学习，避免了替代嵌入和限制性参数假设，同时完全保留输出空间的固有几何结构。

Result: 通过涉及概率分布、网络和对称正定矩阵的广泛模拟，E2M始终达到最先进的性能，其优势在较大样本量时更加明显。在人类死亡率分布和纽约市出租车网络的应用进一步证明了该框架的灵活性和实用性。

Conclusion: E2M提供了一个原则性的机制，用于几何感知预测，避免了替代嵌入和限制性参数假设，同时完全保留输出空间的固有几何结构。

Abstract: Many modern applications involve predicting structured, non-Euclidean outputs
such as probability distributions, networks, and symmetric positive-definite
matrices. These outputs are naturally modeled as elements of general metric
spaces, where classical regression techniques that rely on vector space
structure no longer apply. We introduce E2M (End-to-End Metric regression), a
deep learning framework for predicting metric space-valued outputs. E2M
performs prediction via a weighted Fr\'echet means over training outputs, where
the weights are learned by a neural network conditioned on the input. This
construction provides a principled mechanism for geometry-aware prediction that
avoids surrogate embeddings and restrictive parametric assumptions, while fully
preserving the intrinsic geometry of the output space. We establish theoretical
guarantees, including a universal approximation theorem that characterizes the
expressive capacity of the model and a convergence analysis of the
entropy-regularized training objective. Through extensive simulations involving
probability distributions, networks, and symmetric positive-definite matrices,
we show that E2M consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with its
advantages becoming more pronounced at larger sample sizes. Applications to
human mortality distributions and New York City taxi networks further
demonstrate the flexibility and practical utility of the framework.

Conclusion: 代理潜在空间为生成模型提供了高效的控制机制，支持跨图像、音频、视频和蛋白质等多种模态的下游任务优化。

Abstract: Modern generative AI models such as diffusion and flow matching can sample
from rich data distributions, but many downstream tasks -- such as experimental
design or creative content generation -- require a higher level of control than
unconstrained sampling. The challenge is to efficiently identify outputs that
are both probable under the model and satisfy task-specific constraints. We
address this by introducing surrogate latent spaces: non-parametric,
low-dimensional Euclidean embeddings that can be extracted from any generative
model without additional training. The axes in the Euclidean space can be
defined via examples, providing a simple and interpretable approach to define
custom latent spaces that both express intended features and are convenient to
use in downstream tasks. The representation is Euclidean and has controllable
dimensionality, permitting direct application of standard optimisation
algorithms to traverse the outputs of generative models. Our approach is
architecture-agnostic, incurs almost no additional computational cost, and
generalises across modalities, including images, audio, videos, and structured
objects like proteins.

Motivation: 传统共形预测方法主要优化平均集合大小，但实际应用中最有用的结果是单例预测（明确的决策），现有方法对此关注不足

Method: 从非凸约束优化问题出发，提供几何重构和相关算法，在K类问题中实现O(K)时间复杂度的非共形性评分计算和分裂共形预测集构建

Result: 在图像分类和LLM多项选择题回答实验中，SOCOP相比标准非共形性评分显著提高了单例频率（有时超过20%），对平均集合大小影响最小

Conclusion: SOCOP方法有效提高了共形预测中单例预测的概率，为需要明确决策的应用场景提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Conformal prediction can be used to construct prediction sets that cover the
true outcome with a desired probability, but can sometimes lead to large
prediction sets that are costly in practice. The most useful outcome is a
singleton prediction-an unambiguous decision-yet existing efficiency-oriented
methods primarily optimize average set size. Motivated by this, we propose a
new nonconformity score that aims to minimize the probability of producing
non-singleton sets. Starting from a non-convex constrained optimization problem
as a motivation, we provide a geometric reformulation and associated algorithm
for computing the nonconformity score and associated split conformal prediction
sets in O(K) time for K-class problems. Using this score in split conformal
prediction leads to our proposed Singleton-Optimized Conformal Prediction
(SOCOP) method. We evaluate our method in experiments on image classification
and LLM multiple-choice question-answering, comparing with standard
nonconformity scores such as the (negative) label probability estimates and
their cumulative distribution function; both of which are motivated by
optimizing length. The results show that SOCOP increases singleton frequency
(sometimes by over 20%) compared to the above scores, with minimal impact on
average set size.

Conclusion: 提出的ActiveCQ框架为主动估计因果量提供了统一的理论基础，通过结合高斯过程和条件均值嵌入方法，有效解决了样本效率问题，为成本敏感的实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating causal quantities (CQs) typically requires large datasets, which
can be expensive to obtain, especially when measuring individual outcomes is
costly. This challenge highlights the importance of sample-efficient active
learning strategies. To address the narrow focus of prior work on the
conditional average treatment effect, we formalize the broader task of Actively
estimating Causal Quantities (ActiveCQ) and propose a unified framework for
this general problem. Built upon the insight that many CQs are integrals of
regression functions, our framework models the regression function with a
Gaussian Process. For the distribution component, we explore both a baseline
using explicit density estimators and a more integrated method using
conditional mean embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This latter
approach offers key advantages: it bypasses explicit density estimation,
operates within the same function space as the GP, and adaptively refines the
distributional model after each update. Our framework enables the principled
derivation of acquisition strategies from the CQ's posterior uncertainty; we
instantiate this principle with two utility functions based on information gain
and total variance reduction. A range of simulated and semi-synthetic
experiments demonstrate that our principled framework significantly outperforms
relevant baselines, achieving substantial gains in sample efficiency across a
variety of CQs.

Abstract: Representation learning is a key technique in modern machine learning that
enables models to identify meaningful patterns in complex data. However,
different methods tend to extract distinct aspects of the data, and relying on
a single approach may overlook important insights relevant to downstream tasks.
This paper proposes a performance-enhanced aggregated representation learning
method, which combines multiple representation learning approaches to improve
the performance of downstream tasks. The framework is designed to be general
and flexible, accommodating a wide range of loss functions commonly used in
machine learning models. To ensure computational efficiency, we use surrogate
loss functions to facilitate practical weight estimation. Theoretically, we
prove that our method asymptotically achieves optimal performance in downstream
tasks, meaning that the risk of our predictor is asymptotically equivalent to
the theoretical minimum. Additionally, we derive that our method asymptotically
assigns nonzero weights to correctly specified models. We evaluate our method
on diverse tasks by comparing it with advanced machine learning models. The
experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
baseline methods, showing its effectiveness and broad applicability in
real-world machine learning scenarios.

Abstract: Preference-based data often appear complex and noisy but may conceal
underlying homogeneous structures. This paper introduces a novel framework of
ranking structure recognition for preference-based data. We first develop an
approach to identify dynamic ranking groups by incorporating temporal penalties
into a spectral estimation for the celebrated Bradley-Terry model. To detect
structural changes, we introduce an innovative objective function and present a
practicable algorithm based on dynamic programming. Theoretically, we establish
the consistency of ranking group recognition by exploiting properties of a
random `design matrix' induced by a reversible Markov chain. We also tailor a
group inverse technique to quantify the uncertainty in item ability estimates.
Additionally, we prove the consistency of structure change recognition,
ensuring the robustness of the proposed framework. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the practical utility and
interpretability of our approach.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models are a highly effective method for generating
samples from a distribution of images. We consider scenarios where the training
data comes from a noisy version of the target distribution, and present an
efficiently implementable modification of the inference procedure to generate
noiseless samples. Our approach is motivated by the manifold hypothesis,
according to which meaningful data is concentrated around some low-dimensional
manifold of a high-dimensional ambient space. The central idea is that noise
manifests as low magnitude variation in off-manifold directions in contrast to
the relevant variation of the desired distribution which is mostly confined to
on-manifold directions. We introduce the notion of an extended score and show
that, in a simplified setting, it can be used to reduce small variations to
zero, while leaving large variations mostly unchanged. We describe how its
approximation can be computed efficiently from an approximation to the standard
score and demonstrate its efficacy on toy problems, synthetic data, and real
data.

Motivation: 重新解释基于分数方法的成功机制，从传统的分布学习转向更实用的几何学习视角，揭示流形学习比分布学习对分数近似误差有O(σ⁻²)级别的容忍度优势。

Method: 通过分析小噪声极限下的分数行为，发现信息尺度的尖锐分离：流形信息强度为Θ(σ⁻²)，而分布信息强度为Θ(1)。

Result: 理论分析表明：扩散模型中实现数据支撑集中只需o(σ⁻²)分数误差，而恢复特定分布需要o(1)误差；学习流形上的均匀分布同样具有O(σ⁻²)优势；贝叶斯逆问题中最大熵先验对分数误差更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 基于分数的方法应被视为几何学习而非分布学习，这一视角转变提供了更强的理论保证和实际优势，初步实验在Stable Diffusion等大规模模型上验证了理论发现。

Abstract: Score-based methods, such as diffusion models and Bayesian inverse problems,
are often interpreted as learning the data distribution in the low-noise limit
($\sigma \to 0$). In this work, we propose an alternative perspective: their
success arises from implicitly learning the data manifold rather than the full
distribution. Our claim is based on a novel analysis of scores in the
small-$\sigma$ regime that reveals a sharp separation of scales: information
about the data manifold is $\Theta(\sigma^{-2})$ stronger than information
about the distribution. We argue that this insight suggests a paradigm shift
from the less practical goal of distributional learning to the more attainable
task of geometric learning, which provably tolerates $O(\sigma^{-2})$ larger
errors in score approximation. We illustrate this perspective through three
consequences: i) in diffusion models, concentration on data support can be
achieved with a score error of $o(\sigma^{-2})$, whereas recovering the
specific data distribution requires a much stricter $o(1)$ error; ii) more
surprisingly, learning the uniform distribution on the manifold-an especially
structured and useful object-is also $O(\sigma^{-2})$ easier; and iii) in
Bayesian inverse problems, the maximum entropy prior is $O(\sigma^{-2})$ more
robust to score errors than generic priors. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with preliminary experiments on large-scale models,
including Stable Diffusion.

Abstract: We study empirical risk minimization in a single-head tied-attention layer
trained on synthetic high-dimensional sequence tasks, given by the recently
introduced attention-indexed model. Using tools from random matrix theory,
spin-glass physics, and approximate message passing, we derive sharp
asymptotics for training and test errors, locate interpolation and recovery
thresholds, and characterize the limiting spectral distribution of the learned
weights. Weight decay induces an implicit nuclear-norm regularization, favoring
low-rank query and key matrices. Leveraging this, we compare the standard
factorized training of query and key matrices with a direct parameterization in
which their product is trained element-wise, revealing the inductive bias
introduced by the factorized form. Remarkably, the predicted spectral
distribution echoes empirical trends reported in large-scale transformers,
offering a theoretical perspective consistent with these phenomena.

Abstract: The geometry of dynamical systems estimated from trajectory data is a major
challenge for machine learning applications. Koopman and transfer operators
provide a linear representation of nonlinear dynamics through their spectral
decomposition, offering a natural framework for comparison. We propose a novel
approach representing each system as a distribution of its joint operator
eigenvalues and spectral projectors and defining a metric between systems
leveraging optimal transport. The proposed metric is invariant to the sampling
frequency of trajectories. It is also computationally efficient, supported by
finite-sample convergence guarantees, and enables the computation of Fr\'echet
means, providing interpolation between dynamical systems. Experiments on
simulated and real-world datasets show that our approach consistently
outperforms standard operator-based distances in machine learning applications,

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing noisy,
expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. When the objective exhibits
invariances under a group action, exploiting these symmetries can substantially
improve BO efficiency. While using maximum similarity across group orbits has
long been considered in other domains, the fact that the max kernel is not
positive semidefinite (PSD) has prevented its use in BO. In this work, we
revisit this idea by considering a PSD projection of the max kernel. Compared
to existing invariant (and non-invariant) kernels, we show it achieves
significantly lower regret on both synthetic and real-world BO benchmarks,

Motivation: 研究正交可分解张量的谱学习，旨在理解统计极限、优化几何和初始化之间的复杂关系。与矩阵不同，张量恢复不依赖特征间隙，这可能在噪声条件下提供更好的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用谱学习方法研究正交可分解张量，分析扰动边界、非凸优化几何特性，并探讨各种初始化策略。比较迭代方法（如张量幂迭代）的统计效率。

Result: 发现张量恢复不依赖特征间隙，在噪声条件下具有更好的鲁棒性。迭代方法如张量幂迭代可以达到统计效率，但初始化成为主要计算瓶颈。

Conclusion: 阐明了高效算法何时能达到统计极限，以及何时存在基本障碍。初始化策略在正交可分解张量的谱学习中起着关键作用，是计算效率的主要决定因素。

Abstract: We study spectral learning for orthogonally decomposable (odeco) tensors,
emphasizing the interplay between statistical limits, optimization geometry,
and initialization. Unlike matrices, recovery for odeco tensors does not hinge
on eigengaps, yielding improved robustness under noise. While iterative methods
such as tensor power iterations can be statistically efficient, initialization
emerges as the main computational bottleneck. We investigate perturbation
bounds, non-convex optimization analysis, and initialization strategies,
clarifying when efficient algorithms attain statistical limits and when
fundamental barriers remain.
