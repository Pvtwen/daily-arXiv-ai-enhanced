### [1] [Rate-Adaptive Semantic Communication via Multi-Stage Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02646)
*Jinsung Park,Junyong Shin,Yongjeong Oh,Jihun Park,Yo-Seb Jeon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于多阶段向量量化的速率自适应语义通信框架MSVQ-SC，通过动态激活量化模块实现细粒度速率控制，降低计算复杂度和码本崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单阶段VQ方法需要指数级增大码本才能提高保真度，存在计算复杂度和码本崩溃问题，需要更灵活的速率自适应方案。

Method: 将量化过程分解为多个阶段，动态激活阶段和VQ模块；使用增量分配算法解决模块选择问题；结合熵编码利用非均匀码字分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上的仿真结果表明，该框架优于现有数字语义通信方法，在更低复杂度下实现更优的语义保真度和灵活的速率控制。

Conclusion: MSVQ-SC框架通过多阶段VQ和动态模块激活，有效解决了语义通信中的速率自适应问题，在性能和复杂度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for rate-adaptive semantic
communication based on multi-stage vector quantization (VQ), termed
\textit{MSVQ-SC}. Unlike conventional single-stage VQ approaches, which require
exponentially larger codebooks to achieve higher fidelity, the proposed
framework decomposes the quantization process into multiple stages and
dynamically activates both stages and individual VQ modules. This design
enables fine-grained rate adaptation under varying bit constraints while
mitigating computational complexity and the codebook collapse problem. To
optimize performance, we formulate a module selection problem that minimizes
task loss subject to a rate constraint and solve it using an incremental
allocation algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the framework by incorporating
entropy coding to exploit non-uniform codeword distributions, further reducing
communication overhead. Simulation results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate
that the proposed framework outperforms existing digital semantic communication
methods, achieving superior semantic fidelity with lower complexity while
providing flexible and fine-grained rate control.

### [2] [Mutual Information-Driven Visualization and Clustering for Core KPI Selection in O-RAN Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02696)
*Anish Pradhan,Lingjia Liu,Harpreet S. Dhillon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出AMIF-MDS方法，使用聚合互信息(AMIF)和多维缩放(MDS)来识别O-RAN系统中性能测量之间的依赖关系，从而确定核心性能指标集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着O-RAN系统复杂度增加，性能测量数量呈指数增长，测试变得困难。需要识别各种性能测量之间的依赖关系来简化测试流程和改进系统设计。

Method: 使用聚合互信息(AMIF)作为定向信息的实用代理，结合多维缩放(MDS)来量化和可视化时间序列间的依赖关系，并应用DBSCAN聚类识别相互信息度量的群组。

Result: 该方法成功识别了链路适配指示器和其他群组，并得出了用于未来学习驱动O-RAN测试的核心性能测量集。

Conclusion: AMIF-MDS方法能够有效识别O-RAN性能测量间的依赖关系，为简化测试和系统设计提供了实用工具。

Abstract: O-RAN testing is becoming increasingly difficult with the exponentially
growing number of performance measurements as the system grows more complex,
with additional units, interfaces, applications, and possible implementations
and configurations. To simplify the testing procedure and improve system design
for O-RAN systems, it is important to identify the dependencies among various
performance measurements, which are inherently time-series and can be modeled
as realizations of random processes. While information theory can be utilized
as a principled foundation for mapping these dependencies, the robust
estimation of such measures for random processes from real-world data remains
challenging. This paper introduces AMIF-MDS, which employs aggregate mutual
Information in frequency (AMIF), a practical proxy for directed information
(DI), to quantify similarity and visualize inter-series dependencies with
multidimensional scaling (MDS). The proposed quantile-based AMIF estimator is
applied to O-RAN time-series testing data to identify dependencies among
various performance measures so that we can focus on a set of ``core''
performance measures. Applying density-based spatial clustering of applications
with noise (DBSCAN) to the MDS embedding groups mutually informative metrics,
organically reveals the link-adaptation indicators among other clusters, and
yields a ``core'' performance measure set for future learning-driven O-RAN
testing.

*Yupeng Li,Ruhao Zhang,Yitong Liu,Chunju Shao,Jing Jin,Shijian Gao*

Main category: eess.SP

Motivation: 解决原始信号在导频位置的严重噪声问题，以及深度学习网络训练所需大量数据的问题，提高信道估计精度。

Method: 使用DDPM进行数据去噪和增强，提出无监督结构清理现场数据，通过调整反向步骤生成新信道数据，采用分段前向策略处理不同SNR。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于DDPM的信道估计算法有效解决了噪声和数据不足问题，在通信系统中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This letter introduces a dual application of denoising diffusion
probabilistic model (DDPM)-based channel estimation algorithm integrating data
denoising and augmentation. Denoising addresses the severe noise in raw signals
at pilot locations, which can impair channel estimation accuracy. An
unsupervised structure is proposed to clean field data without prior knowledge
of pure channel information. Data augmentation is crucial due to the
data-intensive nature of training deep learning (DL) networks for channel state
information (CSI) estimation. The network generates new channel data by
adjusting reverse steps, enriching the training dataset. To manage varying
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in communication data, a piecewise forward
strategy is proposed to enhance the DDPM convergence precision. The link-level
simulations indicate that the proposed scheme achieves a superior tradeoff
between precision and computational cost compared to existing benchmarks.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于近完美码的多标签检测方法，用于环境反向散射系统中的零能耗设备检测，显著提高了峰值旁瓣比和标签可分性。

Result: 在CorteXlab测试平台上验证，在低信噪比下表现出鲁棒性，峰值旁瓣比从约11dB提升到约22dB。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际多标签环境中的可扩展、可靠的环境反向散射定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, a novel ultra-low-power indoor localization system based on
Zero-Energy Devices (ZEDs) has shown promising results in ambient backscatter
communication. In this paper, we study detection of multiple coexisting ZEDs in
ambient backscatter systems under interference and synchronization uncertainty.
Building on a Neyman-Pearson (NP) formulation previously applied to single-tag
detection, we introduce a detector tailored to multi-tag scenarios. The core
idea is to use a Near-Perfect Code (NPC) as the synchronization sequence, which
substantially improves the peak-to-sidelobe (PSL) ratio and thus separability
among concurrent tags. The proposed scheme replaces dual band-pass filtering
with dual correlators, enabling an explicit Bayesian detector and tight control
of the false-alarm rate; we further incorporate a contrast metric and
multi-frequency combining to reveal secondary tags. Experiments on the
CorteXlab testbed (part of the SLICES-EU infrastructure) confirm robustness at
low SNR, with observed PSL improvements from about 11 dB to about 22 dB. These
results advance scalable, reliable ambient backscatter localization in
practical multi-tag environments.

Abstract: The mid-band frequency range, combined with extra large-scale multiple-input
multiple-output (XL-MIMO), is emerging as a key enabler for future
communication systems. Thanks to the advent of new spectrum resources and
degrees of freedom brought by the near-field propagation, the mid-band XL-MIMO
system is expected to significantly enhance throughput and inherently support
advanced functionalities such as integrated sensing and communication. Although
theoretical studies have highlighted the benefits of mid-band XL-MIMO systems,
the promised performance gains have yet to be validated in practical systems,
posing a major challenge to the standardization. In this paper, preliminaries
are first discussed, followed by an analysis of key challenges in constructing
a real-time prototype system. Subsequently, the design and implementation of a
real-time mid-band XL-MIMO prototype system are presented. Benefiting from the
novel architecture, the proposed prototype system supports metrics aligned with
standardization, including a bandwidth of 200 MHz, up to 1024 antenna elements,
and up to 256 transceiver chains. Operating in time-division duplexing (TDD)
mode, the prototype enables multiuser communication with support for up to 12
users, while retaining standard communication procedures. Built on
software-defined radio (SDR) platforms, the system is programmable and allows
for flexible deployment of advanced algorithms. Moreover, the modular
architecture ensures high scalability, making the system adaptable to various
configurations, including distributed deployments and decentralized signal
processing. Experimental results with the proposed prototype system demonstrate
real-time digital sample processing at 1167.85 Gbps, a peak data throughput of
15.81 Gbps for 12 users, and a maximal spectral efficiency approaching 80
bit/s/Hz.

Abstract: In this correspondence, a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
framework is proposed to accomplish data communication, vehicle positioning,
and environment sensing simultaneously in a cellular vehicular network. By
incorporating the vehicle positioning problem with the existing
computational-imaging-based ISAC models, we formulate a special integrated
sensing, communication, and positioning problem in which the unknowns are
highly coupled. To mitigate the rank deficiency and make it solvable, we
discretize the region of interest (ROI) into sensing and positioning pixels
respectively, and exploit both the line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight
propagation of the vehicles' uplink access signals. The resultant problem is
shown to be a polynomial bilinear compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction
problem, which is then solved by the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to
iteratively achieve symbol detection, vehicle positioning and environment
sensing. Performance analysis and numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between nerve anatomy and the functional
outcomes of electrical stimulation is critical for optimizing neural interface
design. In this study, we conducted acute experiments on four pigs in which
epineural cuff electrodes with multiple contacts were placed around upper limb
nerves. A subset of electrical stimulation configurations -- previously
identified via computational study -- was applied, and the resulting evoked
electromyographic (EMG) responses were recorded from target muscles. Muscle
recruitment curves were extracted and analysed offline to quantify activation
patterns. Following the electrophysiological experiments, the stimulated nerves
were harvested and processed for histological analysis to visualize fascicular
organization and distribution. This work presents preliminary results from the
combined analysis of muscle activation profiles and fascicle anatomy in one
animal. Our findings aim to inform the design of stimulation strategies by
linking electrode configuration to selective muscle recruitment, ultimately
contributing to more effective neuromodulation and neuroprosthetic
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高铁隧道通信系统需要可靠的无线电波传播预测来确保运营安全，但传统仿真方法计算复杂度高，且无法有效处理实际铁路运营中收集的稀疏测量数据。

Result: 数值仿真验证表明，Inc-GAN能够基于实际列车运营中收集的测量数据准确预测电场，相比传统方法显著提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于实际运营数据的铁路通信系统优化提供了新颖的解决方案。

Abstract: High-speed railway tunnel communication systems require reliable radio wave
propagation prediction to ensure operational safety. However, conventional
simulation methods face challenges of high computational complexity and
inability to effectively process sparse measurement data collected during
actual railway operations. This letter proposes an inception-enhanced
generative adversarial network (Inc-GAN) that can reconstruct complete electric
field distributions across tunnel cross-sections using sparse value lines
measured during actual train operations as input. This directly addresses
practical railway measurement constraints. Through an inception-based generator
architecture and progressive training strategy, the method achieves robust
reconstruction from single measurement signal lines to complete field
distributions. Numerical simulation validation demonstrates that Inc-GAN can
accurately predict electric fields based on measured data collected during
actual train operations, with significantly improved computational efficiency
compared to traditional methods, providing a novel solution for railway
communication system optimization based on real operational data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多频段感知方法受限于经典波束成形或计算复杂度高的方法，需要更高效的集成感知与通信解决方案。

Method: 使用交替方向乘子法辅助的压缩多频段感知框架，基于上行QAM调制导频符号，开发自适应ADMM算法以适应噪声并确保自动停止。

Result: 相比Bartlett型波束成形，ADMM-CMS在实现0.9成功恢复概率时，每天线发射功率增益达34 dB；相比单独在7 GHz和10 GHz子频段进行压缩感知，延迟均方根误差分别降低35%和38.1%。

Conclusion: ADMM-CMS是6G系统在FR3频段实现集成感知与通信的高效使能技术。

Abstract: Joint detection and localization of users and scatterers in multipath-rich
channels on multiple bands is critical for integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) in 6G. Existing multiband sensing methods are limited by classical
beamforming or computationally expensive approaches. This paper introduces
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-assisted compressed
multiband sensing (CMS), hereafter referred to as ADMM-CMS, which is a novel
framework for multiband sensing using uplink QAM-modulated pilot symbols. To
solve the CMS problem, we develop an adaptive ADMM algorithm that adjusts to
noise and ensures automatic stopping if converged. ADMM combines the
decomposability of dual ascent with the robustness of augmented Lagrangian
methods, making it suitable for large-scale structured optimization.
Simulations show that ADMM-CMS achieves higher spatial resolution and improved
denoising compared to Bartlett-type beamforming, yielding a 34 dB gain in
per-antenna transmit power for achieving a 0.9 successful recovery probability
(SRP). Moreover, compared to performing compressed sensing separately on the
constituent 7 GHz and 10 GHz sub-bands, ADMM-CMS achieves reductions in delay
root mean squared error of 35% and 38.1%, respectively, at -41 dBm per-antenna
transmit power, while also yielding improved SRP. Our findings demonstrate
ADMM-CMS as an efficient enabler of ISAC in frequency range 3 (FR3, 7-24 GHz)
for 6G systems.

### [10] [A Study of Neural Polar Decoders for Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03069)
*Rom Hirsch,Ziv Aharoni,Henry D. Pfister,Haim H. Permuter*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 将神经极化解码器(NPD)应用于实际通信系统，在5G信道上相比标准5G极化解码器在BER、BLER和吞吐量方面表现更优，特别适用于低码率和短块配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然先前研究证明了NPD在合成信道上的有效性，但需要将其扩展到实际通信系统以满足实际系统需求。

Method: 将NPD适配到完整的OFDM和单载波通信系统，通过速率匹配支持任意码长、高阶调制，并增强在不同信道条件下的鲁棒性。NPD直接在有记忆的信道上运行，利用信道结构实现更高数据速率，无需导频和循环前缀。

Result: 在5G信道上的实验结果表明，NPD在BER、BLER和吞吐量方面持续优于5G极化解码器，特别是在低码率和短块配置下改进显著。单载波系统的NPD性能与OFDM相当但具有更低的PAPR。

Conclusion: NPD可作为高性能、无导频且鲁棒的解码解决方案，适用于实际通信系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we adapt and analyze Neural Polar Decoders (NPDs) for
end-to-end communication systems. While prior work demonstrated the
effectiveness of NPDs on synthetic channels, this study extends the NPD to
real-world communication systems. The NPD was adapted to complete OFDM and
single-carrier communication systems. To satisfy practical system requirements,
the NPD is extended to support any code length via rate matching, higher-order
modulations, and robustness across diverse channel conditions. The NPD operates
directly on channels with memory, exploiting their structure to achieve higher
data rates without requiring pilots and a cyclic prefix. Although NPD entails
higher computational complexity than the standard 5G polar decoder, its neural
network architecture enables an efficient representation of channel statistics,
resulting in manageable complexity suitable for practical systems. Experimental
results over 5G channels demonstrate that the NPD consistently outperforms the
5G polar decoder in terms of BER, BLER, and throughput. These improvements are
particularly significant for low-rate and short-block configurations, which are
prevalent in 5G control channels. Furthermore, NPDs applied to single-carrier
systems offer performance comparable to OFDM with lower PAPR, enabling
effective single-carrier transmission over 5G channels. These results position
the NPD as a high-performance, pilotless, and robust decoding solution.

*Junru Hua,Rahul Ahluwalia,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于极值预测的数据增强框架，结合GANs和SMOTE等数据增强方法与深度学习模型（Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM），通过基于相关函数的策略改进极值区域预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极值预测在金融和气候变化等领域具有重要应用价值，但面临数据稀缺的挑战。传统数据增强方法主要针对模式分类和计算机视觉应用，需要专门针对极值预测的数据增强框架。

Method: 使用Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步超前预测，结合GANs和SMOTE等数据增强技术，并提出了基于相关函数的极值数据增强策略。

Result: SMOTE-based策略在短期和长期预测中均表现出更好的适应性，Conv-LSTM在周期性稳定数据集中表现优异，BD-LSTM在混沌或非平稳序列中表现更好。

Conclusion: 数据增强能有效提升极值预测性能，不同模型在不同数据特性下具有互补优势，SMOTE方法在计算效率和预测准确性方面表现最佳。

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary
sequences.

*Shaifalee Saxena,Alan Williams,Rafael Fierro,Alexander Scheinker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合深度强化学习(DRL)和有界极值搜索(ES)的混合控制器，用于提高非线性时变系统的鲁棒性控制性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL能够从大数据集中学习以快速控制多参数系统，但在系统模型快速变化时性能会急剧下降；而ES虽然能处理时变系统和未知控制方向，但收敛速度慢且容易陷入局部最优。

Method: 将DRL和ES结合形成混合控制器：DRL利用历史数据快速学习多参数系统的控制策略，ES确保对时变系统的鲁棒性。

Result: 混合控制器的性能超过了单独使用DRL或ES的效果，在数值研究和粒子加速器自动调谐应用中表现出色。

Conclusion: DRL和ES的结合能够发挥各自优势，实现既快速又鲁棒的控制性能，特别适用于时变多参数系统的控制问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

TL;DR: OpenTSLM是一个时间序列语言模型家族，通过将时间序列作为原生模态集成到预训练LLMs中，解决了LLMs无法处理时间序列的限制。该研究提出了两种架构：SoftPrompt（隐式建模）和Flamingo（显式建模），在多个医疗时间序列推理任务中显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多模态数据解释方面表现出强大能力，但在医学领域面临无法处理时间序列数据的主要限制。为了克服这一差距，需要开发能够理解和推理时间序列的模型。

Method: 提出了两种架构：OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt通过软提示将可学习的时间序列标记与文本标记连接进行隐式建模；OpenTSLM-Flamingo通过交叉注意力机制将时间序列与文本集成进行显式建模。在三个数据集（HAR-CoT、Sleep-CoT、ECG-QA-CoT）上进行基准测试。

Result: OpenTSLM模型在所有任务中都优于基线模型，在睡眠分期任务中达到69.9 F1，在HAR任务中达到65.4 F1，而仅文本微调模型分别为9.05和52.2。即使是1B参数的OpenTSLM模型也超过了GPT-4o的表现（15.47和2.95）。OpenTSLM-Flamingo在性能上与SoftPrompt相当，在长序列上表现更好，且内存需求稳定。

Conclusion: OpenTSLM成功地将时间序列作为原生模态集成到LLMs中，显著提升了时间序列推理能力。显式建模方法（Flamingo）在性能和内存效率方面都优于隐式方法（SoftPrompt）。该研究为时间序列语言建模提供了开源工具和基准数据集。

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models

*Lin Chen,Jun Chen,Minghui Qiu,Shuxin Zhong,Binghong Chen,Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RainSeer是一个结构感知的降雨场重建框架，利用雷达反射率作为物理结构先验，通过两阶段架构解决雷达体积场到地面降雨的转换问题，显著提升了降雨场重建的精度和结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间插值方法在重建高分辨率降雨场时往往过度平滑，无法捕捉尖锐过渡和局域极端值，这影响了洪水预报、水文建模和气候分析的准确性。

Method: RainSeer采用物理信息驱动的两阶段架构：1) 结构到点映射器通过双向映射将中尺度雷达结构投影到局域地面降雨；2) 地理感知降雨解码器通过因果时空注意力机制捕捉水凝物下降、融化和蒸发的语义转换。

Result: 在两个公共数据集(RAIN-F和MeteoNet)上的评估显示，RainSeer相比最先进基线方法持续改进，MAE降低超过13.31%，并显著提升了重建降雨场的结构保真度。

Conclusion: RainSeer通过将雷达反射率重新解释为物理结构先验，成功解决了雷达体积场到地面降雨观测的转换挑战，为高精度降雨场重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

### [15] [How to Train Your Advisor: Steering Black-Box LLMs with Advisor Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02453)
*Parth Asawa,Alan Zhu,Matei Zaharia,Alexandros G. Dimakis,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Advisor Models方法，通过轻量级参数化策略在上下文环境中向黑盒模型发出自然语言指导指令，实现动态优化而非静态提示优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型作为黑盒服务部署时，模型权重无法修改，只能通过提示进行定制。静态提示优化产生单一固定提示，无法适应不同输入、用户或环境。

Method: 使用强化学习训练轻量级参数化策略（Advisor Models），作为第二个小模型位于输入和模型之间，基于环境奖励信号对每个实例进行行为塑造。

Result: 在涉及推理和个性化的多个领域中，Advisor Models优于静态提示优化器，能够发现环境动态并提高下游任务性能。

Conclusion: Advisor Models为黑盒系统提供了可学习的接口，是使个性化与环境自适应AI具备前沿能力的有前景方向。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

### [16] [Market-Based Data Subset Selection -- Principled Aggregation of Multi-Criteria Example Utility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02456)
*Ashish Jha,Valentin Leplat,AH Phan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于预测市场的训练数据选择方法，通过市场机制自动整合多种信号（不确定性、稀有性、多样性等），用单一流动性参数控制选择集中度，在固定计算预算下实现多信号数据筛选的统一框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练数据选择方法需要手动组合异构信号（不确定性、稀有性、多样性等），权重设置随意，缺乏统一框架。

Method: 使用成本函数预测市场（LMSR）为每个样本定价，信号作为交易者，通过价格-每令牌规则处理令牌预算，加入轻量级多样性头提高覆盖度。

Result: 在GSM8K（60k令牌预算）上，市场方法达到强基线性能，减少种子方差，选择开销<0.1 GPU小时；在AGNews（保留5-25%数据）上实现竞争性准确率，改善平衡性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架在固定计算预算下统一了多信号数据筛选，适用于提示级推理和分类任务，提供了透明的聚合强度控制。

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索PTQ在安全关键环境中可能导致的极端性能下降，分析输入分布特征如何引发这种下降，强调实际部署中需要谨慎。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏和强化学习来学习网络和位宽策略对，分析量化下的最坏情况失效潜力。

Result: 确认存在"有害"的网络-策略对，多个实例显示精度下降10-65%，而稳健对应物仅下降<2%。通过系统实验提供了最高脆弱点的初步探索。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调在现实世界部署中需要谨慎，鼓励对鲁棒性进行更严格的检查，并在深度学习领域更重视安全考虑。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

TL;DR: 论文发现了超参数损失曲面的新结构，提出了一种基于随机搜索的新理论来理解超参数优化中的渐近行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超参数对模型能力影响巨大，但现代模型规模过大无法进行广泛搜索。目前缺乏理解超参数损失曲面的工具。

Method: 开发了一种基于随机搜索的新技术来揭示损失曲面的渐近状态，发现在接近最优解时损失曲面呈现出简单结构，由有效维度和最佳可能损失等基本特征定义。

Result: 发现了随机搜索最佳分数的新分布，其参数正好定义了渐近状态下的损失曲面特征。推导出了随机搜索的渐近定律，可以解释和推断其收敛性。

Conclusion: 这些新工具支持新的分析，如最佳性能的置信区间或确定有效超参数数量，相关工具已在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

TL;DR: SAGE是一种流式数据子集选择方法，通过维护梯度几何的紧凑Frequent Directions草图，优先选择与共识方向对齐的样本，实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络在大型数据集上训练计算和能耗密集，需要高效的子集选择方法来减少计算和内存需求。

Method: 使用Frequent Directions草图在O(ℓD)内存中维护梯度几何，通过两遍GPU友好的流水线消除N×N成对相似性和显式N×ℓ梯度存储，基于草图梯度与共识方向的对齐度对样本评分。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SAGE使用小子集预算训练，保持与全数据训练和最新子集选择基线相当的准确性，同时减少端到端计算和峰值内存。

Conclusion: SAGE提供了一种实用的恒定内存替代方案，与剪枝和模型压缩互补，用于高效训练。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个在差分隐私保护下计算Wasserstein重心的方法，并在合成数据、MNIST和大规模人口数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wasserstein重心在机器学习、统计学和计算机图形学中有广泛应用，但输入数据通常是来自敏感数据集的经验分布，因此需要差分隐私保护。

Method: 开发了在差分隐私约束下计算Wasserstein重心的算法。

Result: 在合成数据、MNIST和大规模美国人口数据集上的实验表明，该方法能生成高质量的私有重心，并在准确性和隐私性之间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: 这是首个在差分隐私框架下计算Wasserstein重心的可行方法，为处理敏感数据的重心计算提供了隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter is defined as the mean of a set of probability
measures under the optimal transport metric, and has numerous applications
spanning machine learning, statistics, and computer graphics. In practice these
input measures are empirical distributions built from sensitive datasets,
motivating a differentially private (DP) treatment. We present, to our
knowledge, the first algorithms for computing Wasserstein barycenters under
differential privacy. Empirically, on synthetic data, MNIST, and large-scale
U.S. population datasets, our methods produce high-quality private barycenters
with strong accuracy-privacy tradeoffs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于不确定性的模型选择策略，通过选择预测不确定性最低的TabPFN模型进行集成，在siRNA敲低效能预测任务中优于传统集成方法和单一模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习器如TabPFN在生物分子效能预测中表现优异，但其性能对提供的上下文高度敏感。如何在无法获得真实标签的情况下选择最佳模型进行集成是一个开放性问题。

Method: 使用TabPFN模型和简单序列特征，通过模型预测的inter-quantile range(IQR)作为不确定性度量，选择不确定性最低的模型进行集成。

Result: TabPFN模型在siRNA敲低效能预测任务中超越了专门的先进预测器；模型的不确定性(IQR)与真实预测误差呈负相关；基于不确定性选择的模型集成方法优于传统集成和单一模型。

Conclusion: 模型不确定性是一种强大的、无需标签的启发式方法，可用于优化生物分子效能预测。

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于分数蒸馏的快速蛋白质骨架生成方法，通过Score identity Distillation技术训练少步采样生成器，在保持生成质量的同时将采样速度提升20倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于扩散和流的蛋白质生成模型采样速度慢的问题，这些模型通常需要数百次迭代步骤，限制了在大规模蛋白质发现中的实际应用。

Method: 采用Score identity Distillation技术，结合多步生成和推理时噪声调制，训练少步蛋白质骨架生成器。

Result: 蒸馏后的少步生成器实现了超过20倍的采样速度提升，同时保持了与Proteina教师模型相当的可设计性、多样性和新颖性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了推理成本，使基于扩散的模型更接近实际的蛋白质工程应用，实现了大规模计算机蛋白质设计。

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练时间长、能耗巨大，现代模型需要数月计算时间和千兆瓦时电力，亟需解决这些效率问题。

Method: 结合架构改进和算法增强，优化transformer注意力机制和MLP层，最大化模型FLOPs利用率，同时保持与标准transformer实现的兼容性。

Result: 在3B和30B参数Llama模型上测试显示：训练吞吐量提升2-6倍，能耗降低55%-83%，在多节点H200 GPU集群上验证有效。

Conclusion: 这些优化方法具有模型和硬件无关性，可广泛应用于transformer架构，并扩展到监督微调和直接偏好优化等后训练阶段。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation
and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce
Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad
applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training
phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习率预热已成为深度学习中的普遍启发式方法，但其理论基础尚未得到充分理解，本文旨在提供原理性解释。

Method: 基于广义(L0,L1)-平滑性条件，该条件将局部曲率约束为损失次优性的线性函数，并证明了该条件在常见神经网络架构中成立。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，在预热调度下的梯度下降比固定步长收敛更快，建立了上下复杂度界。

Conclusion: 预热策略在理论和实践中都被证实能带来训练效益，特别是在语言和视觉模型中表现显著。

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language
and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Action-Controllable Factorization (ACF)的对比学习方法，用于从高维观察中发现可独立控制的潜在变量，解决了传统方法需要预先知道因子化表示的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因子化MDP方法需要预先知道因子化表示，这在智能体只能看到高维观察时失效；而深度强化学习虽然能处理高维输入，但无法利用因子化结构。

Method: ACF利用稀疏性原理：动作通常只影响变量的子集，而其余变量在环境动态下演化，这为对比训练提供了信息丰富的数据。

Result: ACF在三个具有已知因子化结构的基准测试（Taxi、FourRooms和MiniGrid-DoorKey）上直接从像素观察中恢复了真实可控因子，始终优于基线解耦算法。

Conclusion: ACF成功解决了表示问题，能够从高维观察中发现可独立控制的潜在变量，为结合因子化MDP和深度强化学习的优势提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的LLM推理策略Best-of-Majority (BoM)，结合了多数投票和Best-of-N的优势，在Pass@k设置下实现了最优的推理扩展性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM推理中的多数投票和Best-of-N策略在困难任务下表现不佳，特别是在Pass@k评估设置中缺乏理想的扩展性。

Method: 提出Best-of-Majority策略，首先限制候选集为高频响应，然后选择前k个奖励最高的响应，结合了多数投票和BoN的优点。

Result: 理论证明当采样预算N=Ω(C*)时，BoM的遗憾为O(ε_opt + √(ε_RM²C*/k))，并建立了匹配的下界，证明算法是最小最大最优的。数学问题推理实验显示BoM优于多数投票和BoN。

Conclusion: BoM是一种在Pass@k设置下具有最优扩展性能的LLM推理策略，其性能不会随N增加而下降，优于现有方法。

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了监督微调(SFT)与逆强化学习的等价性，证明SFT不仅学习策略，还学习隐式的密集奖励模型，并提出了从SFT模型中恢复密集奖励信号的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上将SFT视为简单的模仿学习过程，但本文挑战这一观点，旨在证明SFT实际上是一种强大的奖励学习机制。

Method: 建立了SFT与逆Q学习的等价性，提出了基线相对奖励函数来从SFT模型中恢复密集奖励信号，并开发了Dense-Path REINFORCE方法。

Result: Dense-Path REINFORCE方法在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于原始SFT模型。

Conclusion: SFT不仅是对策略的模仿，更是一种强大的奖励学习机制，为利用专家演示开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

Motivation: 模拟内存计算加速器使用电阻交叉阵列直接在内存中进行深度神经网络计算，但实际中许多有前景的忆阻器件（如ReRAM）由于制造限制只有约4位分辨率，这种有限的更新精度会显著降低训练精度。

Method: 采用残差学习框架，在多块交叉阵列片上顺序学习以补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差。理论分析显示最优性差距随片数增加而缩小，并实现线性收敛速率。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，该方法在有限状态设置下始终优于最先进的模拟内存训练策略，成本分析确认仅产生适度的硬件开销。

Conclusion: 该残差学习框架能够有效解决有限状态忆阻器件的训练精度问题，为实际应用中的片上训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了Spectral Geodesic Flow Matching (SFMG)框架，通过谱特征映射将图嵌入到连续黎曼流形中，定义测地流并沿流匹配分布来生成图，在保持性能的同时实现30倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图生成方法通常只对齐图的谱或度分布，但忽略了特征向量诱导的几何结构和图的全局结构。

Method: 使用谱特征映射将输入图和目标图嵌入到连续黎曼流形中，定义测地流，并沿这些流匹配分布来生成输出图。

Result: SFMG在多种基准测试中在图元、度和谱指标上与最先进方法性能相当，同时比基于扩散的模型快30倍，并能泛化到未见过的图规模。

Conclusion: SFMG通过将谱几何与流匹配相结合，为图合成提供了一种新方法，具有更好的几何结构捕捉能力、灵活性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its
ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new
approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow
matching.

TL;DR: 提出基于动物间变换类(IATC)的模型-脑比较方法，通过双向映射评估神经网络模型能否像典型受试者一样表现，解决了模型预测性与机制准确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏比较模型激活与脑响应的共识方法，需要建立更严格的比较框架来评估神经网络作为脑机制模型的准确性。

Method: 使用IATC方法，识别在动物种群中准确映射神经响应所需的最严格函数集，通过双向映射评估模型能否像真实受试者一样被变换。

Result: IATC能够解析神经机制的细节特征（如非线性激活函数），实现神经活动的高精度预测，同时在不同脑区响应模式间实现高特异性区分。

Conclusion: IATC证明模型预测性与机制准确性之间不存在固有权衡，为深度神经网络作为视觉系统模型提供了新证据，改进了模型-脑比较方法。

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided
transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural
networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables
principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the
predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon
previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

Motivation: 开发能够同时处理纵向可穿戴数据时序聚类和结果预测的模型，以识别行为亚型并提供临床可解释的风险解释。

Method: 使用注意力GRU自编码器联合优化三个目标：序列重构学习紧凑潜在表示、二元分类预测抑郁率、GMM软聚类识别行为亚型。

Result: 在372名参与者数据上，聚类质量（轮廓系数0.70 vs 0.32-0.70）和抑郁分类（AUC 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67）均优于基线；332名参与者的外部验证确认了聚类的可重复性。

Conclusion: AttentiveGRUAE在纵向可穿戴数据分析中表现出色，能够识别临床相关的行为亚型，并通过时间注意力机制提供可解释的风险解释。

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated
recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and
prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs
0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67).
Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters
and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep
regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

Motivation: 尽管图神经网络取得了显著进展，但其有限的表达能力仍然是一个基本挑战。现有的GNN表达能力研究产生了许多表达能力强的架构，但图神经网络相对于节点特征的导数作为增强表达能力的手段尚未被探索。

Method: 引入高阶导数GNN（HOD-GNN），通过利用基础模型的高阶节点导数来增强消息传递神经网络（MPNN）的表达能力。这些导数生成具有表达力的结构感知节点嵌入，由第二个GNN在端到端可训练架构中处理。

Result: 理论证明HOD-GNN架构族的表达能力与WL层次结构对齐，并与子图GNN和流行的结构编码方案建立了深层联系。在流行的图学习基准上的评估表明HOD-GNN在图学习任务上表现出色。

Conclusion: 高阶节点导数提供了一种自然的方式来增强GNN的表达能力，HOD-GNN方法在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

increased reproducibility. For geospatial machine learning (GeoML), the
availability of Earth observation data has outpaced the development of domain

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标网络虽然稳定但学习速度慢，而在线网络虽然直观但会导致学习不稳定。作者希望结合两者的优点，实现快速且稳定的价值函数学习。

Method: 提出MINTO方法，使用目标网络和在线网络的最小值估计来计算目标值，从而减少在线网络可能带来的高估偏差。该方法可以无缝集成到各种基于价值和演员-评论家算法中。

Result: 在在线和离线强化学习、离散和连续动作空间等多种基准测试中，MINTO始终提高了性能表现。

Conclusion: MINTO通过简单而有效的修改，实现了更快更稳定的价值函数学习，具有广泛的适用性和有效性。

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value
functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target
network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of
slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic
modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive
improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding.
Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-
and temporally-varying process dominance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征过滤器依赖统计成对依赖度量来建模特征-目标关系，但当目标依赖于高阶特征交互而非个体贡献时，这种方法可能会失败。

Method: 使用神经网络参数化互信息近似，通过精心设计的损失函数和稀疏诱导正则化器进行特征选择，采用两阶段过程分离表示学习和特征选择。

Result: 在合成和真实欺诈数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法能有效捕捉复杂特征-目标关系，并能执行精确解决方案。

Conclusion: MINERVA方法能够有效处理传统方法难以捕捉的高阶特征交互问题，在特征选择任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA通过超网络机制有效加速了AdaLoRA的收敛，提供了一种高效且通用的参数高效微调解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

Conclusion: 这是首个系统优化驱动式传感平台的研究，提出了专门设计的检测车辆配置。

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency-domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

Motivation: 随着学生越来越多地使用LLMs作为学习辅助工具，需要构建能够处理辅导细微差别的模型，包括识别学生核心需求、适应性、个性化指导和准确性。

Method: 构建TutorBench数据集，包含高中和AP课程水平的1,490个样本，涵盖三个辅导任务：自适应解释、作业反馈和提示生成。使用样本特定评分标准和LLM-judge进行自动评估。

Result: 评估了16个前沿LLMs，结果显示所有模型得分均不超过56%，在辅导技能相关标准上的通过率低于60%。不同模型家族表现各异：Claude模型在支持主动学习方面表现最好，但在其他两个用例中落后。

Conclusion: 当前前沿LLMs在展示完整辅导技能方面仍有不足，TutorBench为开发下一代AI辅导系统提供了全面且未饱和的基准。

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated
benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于指数集中现象的低精度浮点数格式ECF8，通过理论分析和实验验证，在保持计算无损的同时实现了显著的内存节省和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 指数集中现象是训练模型的一个统计规律，为FP8时代的无损低精度浮点设计开辟了原则性路径。

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型能有效捕捉训练数据分布，但需要根据下游应用通过奖励函数调整分布。现有策略梯度方法（如PPO）在扩散模型中因边缘似然难以处理而受限。

Method: 1. 将RAFT变体统一为GRAFT框架，证明其隐含执行带重塑奖励的PPO；2. 提出P-GRAFT在中间噪声级别调整分布；3. 提出逆噪声校正改进流模型。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、布局生成、分子生成和无条件图像生成等任务上验证。Stable Diffusion 2在T2I基准上VQAScore优于策略梯度方法，相对基础模型提升8.81%。无条件图像生成中，逆噪声校正以更低FLOPs/图像改善FID。

Conclusion: GRAFT框架有效统一了RAFT方法，P-GRAFT通过中间噪声调整实现更有效的微调，逆噪声校正可在无显式奖励下改进模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域，离线强化学习需要避免灾难性风险，但现有风险规避方法过于保守且限制策略类别，而表达性策略只在风险中性设置中使用。

Method: 提出RAMAC框架，将表达性生成actor与分布critic耦合，通过生成路径区分组合目标（分布风险和BC损失），在复杂多模态场景中实现风险敏感学习。

Result: 在大多数Stochastic-D4RL任务中，RAMAC在保持强回报的同时，在CVaR0.1指标上获得持续提升。

Conclusion: RAMAC框架成功解决了离线强化学习中风险规避与策略表达性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

Abstract: The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian
domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due
to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks.
Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability,
efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource
constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net,
a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion
detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self

spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse
intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline
and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection
within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone
Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records,
demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in
multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while
maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比属性图聚类方法主要依赖边作为辅助信息获取节点级嵌入表示，仅关注节点级嵌入增强，忽略了边级嵌入增强以及不同粒度下节点级和边级嵌入增强的交互作用。同时，这些方法通常平等对待所有对比样本对，忽视了硬/易正负样本对之间的显著差异，限制了其判别能力。

Method: RAGC方法包含两个核心模块：混合协作增强(HCA)同时执行节点级和边级嵌入表示与增强，建立更全面的相似性度量标准；对比样本自适应差分感知(CSADA)利用高置信度伪标签信息，自适应识别所有对比样本对，并通过创新的权重调制函数进行差异化处理。两个模块在良性循环中相互促进。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的综合图聚类评估表明，所提出的RAGC方法在多个最先进的CAGC方法中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: RAGC通过混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知策略，有效提升了表示学习的判别能力，在属性图聚类任务中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

TL;DR: TokenFlow是一个新颖的LLM服务系统，通过抢占式请求调度和主动KV缓存管理，显著提升文本流式传输性能，在保持整体token吞吐量的同时提高有效吞吐量并降低响应延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时LLM交互需要流式token生成，但现有系统由于非抢占式请求调度和被动内存管理导致资源利用率低、请求处理并行度差，特别是在请求突发时表现不佳。

Method: TokenFlow采用动态请求优先级调度（基于token缓冲区占用率和token消耗率），并主动在GPU和CPU内存间传输KV缓存，同时重叠I/O与计算以最小化请求抢占开销。

Result: 在Llama3-8B和Qwen2.5-32B模型及多种GPU上的实验表明，TokenFlow有效吞吐量提升高达82.5%，P99 TTFT降低高达80.2%，且不降低整体token吞吐量。

Conclusion: TokenFlow通过创新的抢占式调度和主动KV缓存管理机制，显著提升了LLM服务的流式传输性能，为实时LLM交互提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV
cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with
computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on
Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200)
demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput
(accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to
80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to
segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了生物神经网络是否使用类似梯度下降的学习策略，发现非梯度的"旋度"组件可以在不影响优化能力的情况下存在于学习动态中，这些旋度项在抑制-兴奋性连接或Hebbian/反Hebbian可塑性中自然出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生物神经网络是否使用梯度下降策略，以及多样化的突触可塑性规则是否构成梯度下降的近似。

Method: 使用前馈网络在可分析的学生-教师框架内，通过规则翻转可塑性的神经元系统性地引入非梯度动态。

Result: 小旋度项保持原始解流形的稳定性，学习动态类似梯度下降；强旋度项会破坏解流形稳定性，可能导致混沌学习动态或意外加速学习。

Conclusion: 特定架构能够通过多样化的学习规则支持稳健学习，为神经网络中基于梯度学习的规范性理论提供了重要补充。

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

Motivation: 研究动机是探究常见的安全干预措施（如拒绝训练或元标签训练）在面对简单的激活编辑时是否仍然有效，评估模型安全性的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用模型消融技术移除拒绝敏感方向，在SmolLM2-1.7B的安全预训练检查点上进行控制评估，对20个系统（原始和消融后）发出100个提示，使用多个评判者分类响应为拒绝或非拒绝。

Conclusion: 研究提供了检查点级别的安全组件鲁棒性特征描述，并提出了将推理时编辑整合到安全评估中的实用协议。

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

Conclusion: 该工作首次为深度ReLU网络建立了最优泛化率，仅产生多项式深度依赖，为理解梯度下降在深度学习中的泛化性能提供了重要理论保证。

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的在线共形预测方法，通过用更广泛的函数类别替代二元评估来量化预测区间的相关性，从而产生更窄的预测区间同时保持覆盖有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线共形预测方法在阈值更新步骤中仅关注预测区间的有效性（真实值是否在区间内），而忽略了区间的相关性。本文旨在利用这一被忽视的方面来改进方法。

Method: 提出在阈值更新步骤中，用一类更广泛的函数替代二元评估（内部/外部），这些函数使用真实值来量化预测区间的相关性。这种方法有助于防止阈值突变，可能产生更窄的预测区间。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，这些函数相比现有的OCP方法能够产生更紧的区间，同时保持覆盖有效性。

Conclusion: 通过考虑预测区间的相关性而不仅仅是有效性，可以改进在线共形预测方法，产生更窄的预测区间，同时保持所需的覆盖保证。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLEAR方法，首次对Transformer架构各组件进行细粒度推理能耗分析，发现注意力块的能耗与FLOPs不成比例，为构建节能Transformer模型提供了组件级优化基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理在全球范围内持续进行，已成为AI能耗的主要来源，但现有研究缺乏细粒度测量方法，仅报告粗粒度的模型级指标，未能将能效作为主要目标。

Method: 提出CLEAR方法，通过重复采样克服微秒级组件执行与毫秒级能耗监测的时间不匹配问题，评估了15个涵盖四种架构类型的模型。

Result: 注意力块每FLOP消耗显著更多能量，表明能耗与FLOP计数不成比例，FLOPs无法准确反映组件级真实能耗成本。组件级能耗方差保持在9.5%以下，捕获了模型总能耗的90%以上。

Conclusion: 建立了详细的组件级能耗基准，为通过组件级优化构建节能Transformer模型提供了重要见解和基础。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法容易受到伪相关性的影响，特别是在测试数据分布偏移时。现有方法如Group DRO虽然对组间偏移鲁棒，但对组内分布偏移仍然脆弱，这在样本有限的少数群体中尤为常见。

Method: 提出了层次化Group DRO扩展，同时处理组间和组内不确定性，提供多层次的分布偏移鲁棒性。

Result: 在新设计的模拟现实少数群体分布偏移的基准测试中，该方法表现出强鲁棒性，而现有鲁棒学习方法均失败。在标准基准测试中也取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，扩大模糊集以更好地捕捉组间和组内分布不确定性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机顺序模型中的输入序列虽然渐近等价于随机i.i.d.输入，但在有限时间内可能表现出显著的非平稳性，这会阻碍随机学习算法的性能。现有的对抗性输入算法虽然能保持遗憾保证，但简单的无遗憾算法在随机顺序实例中可能失效。

Method: 提出了一个通用模板来调整随机学习算法，使其适应随机顺序模型，而不显著影响其遗憾保证。

Result: 该方法能够恢复延迟预测、带约束的在线学习和切换成本的赌博机等场景的改进遗憾界限。此外，证明了在随机顺序下，在线分类的可学习性由VC维度而非Littlestone维度刻画。

Conclusion: 该模板成功地将随机学习算法适配到随机顺序模型，提供了与一般对抗模型的进一步分离，特别是在在线分类中VC维度成为可学习性的关键特征。

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

Method: 采用自适应混合精度量化方案，选择性对值范围小的特征通道应用低比特计算，使用高效的比特降低方法最小化量化误差，同时实时调整低比特通道比例。

Result: 在11个卷积和基于transformer的视觉模型上评估，FlexiQ在4位模型上平均实现6.6%的精度提升，优于四种最先进的量化技术。50%4位模型仅损失0.6%精度，达到100%4位模型相对于8位模型40%的加速效果。

Conclusion: FlexiQ在NPU和GPU上引入最小运行时开销，证明了其硬件效率和整体性能优势，能够有效管理波动的推理工作负载。

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and
GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and
it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for
computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to
feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art
quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an
efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ
introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and
overall performance benefits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在处理长序列任务时面临计算负担与表达能力之间的平衡挑战，需要找到既能最大化表达能力又能限制计算成本的方法。

Method: 利用控制理论中的Hankel奇异值分析，在训练过程中识别高能量状态维度并进行平衡截断，从大模型开始训练并在训练过程中逐步缩小维度。

Result: 实验表明，训练过程中的降维显著加速了优化过程，压缩后的模型保留了任务关键结构，性能优于直接训练的小维度模型。

Conclusion: 从大模型开始训练并在训练过程中逐步缩小的SSMs能够在实现计算效率的同时保持更高的性能表现。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

Result: 识别了三个关键设计选择对模型效率和保真度的具体影响；展示了该框架可扩展到图生成和概率性天气预报等任务；提出了VAR利用扩散生态系统工具的实用接口。

Conclusion: 迭代精化框架为理解VAR提供了新视角，揭示了其高效性的关键因素，并展示了该框架在多领域的扩展潜力，同时保持了少步、尺度并行生成的优势。

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

Motivation: 现有深度学习和梯度提升模型在预测个性化健康结果时牺牲了可解释性，且未能充分处理个体间差异。需要开发既准确又可解释的个性化健康预测方法。

Result: 在CH-2025数据集（10个受试者约450个日观测）上的评估显示，SASL-LightGBM混合框架在预测性能上与复杂黑盒方法相当，但参数更少、透明度更高。

Conclusion: SASL框架在保持可解释性的同时实现了与黑盒方法相当的预测准确性，为临床医生提供了清晰可操作的见解。

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear
and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

Conclusion: Karma模型具有鲁棒性、泛化能力和物理一致性，为各种应用场景提供更安全可靠的电池管理解决方案。

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large
language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time
Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMark是首个专门为扩散大语言模型设计的水印框架，通过三种互补策略解决传统水印方法在非顺序解码模型上的失效问题，在保持文本质量的同时实现92.0-99.5%的高检测率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型提供比自回归模型更快的生成速度且保持可比质量，但由于其非顺序解码特性，现有的水印方法无法适用，因为传统水印依赖于因果顺序设计。

Method: DMark引入三种策略：预测水印（在缺乏实际上下文时使用模型预测的token）、双向水印（利用扩散解码特有的前后依赖关系）、预测-双向水印（结合两者最大化检测强度）。

Result: 在多个扩散大语言模型上的实验显示，DMark在1%误报率下达到92.0-99.5%的检测率，而现有方法的简单适配只能达到49.6-71.2%，同时保持文本质量。

Conclusion: DMark证明了有效水印对于非自回归语言模型是可行的，并展示了对抗文本操作的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

TL;DR: Cell-MNN是一种端到端的编码器-解码器架构，通过学习局部线性化的ODE来建模细胞分化动态，能够发现可解释的基因相互作用，并在单细胞基准测试中取得竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的细胞分化动态模型依赖计算成本高的最优传输预处理和多阶段训练，且无法发现明确的基因相互作用。

Method: 提出Cell-MNN编码器-解码器架构，其潜在表示是控制从干细胞到组织细胞演化动态的局部线性化ODE，完全端到端训练（除标准PCA预处理外）。

Result: Cell-MNN在单细胞基准测试中达到竞争性性能，在扩展到更大数据集和跨多个数据集联合训练方面超越现有基线，并学习到可解释的基因相互作用（通过TRRUST数据库验证）。

Conclusion: Cell-MNN能够有效建模细胞分化动态，同时提供生物学一致且可解释的基因相互作用，为疾病理解和治疗提供新工具。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

Motivation: 解决非IID设置下联邦学习的性能下降和公平性问题，特别关注提升表现不佳客户端的训练效果。

Method: 结合动态提升机制和自适应梯度聚合策略，采用类似SAMME算法的权重分配机制，为低错误率客户端分配更高权重，同时动态调整焦点损失参数来强调难以分类的样本。

Result: 在MNIST、FEMNIST和CIFAR10三个基准数据集上的评估显示，FeDABoost相比FedAvg和Ditto实现了更好的公平性和竞争性性能。

Conclusion: FeDABoost框架有效提升了联邦学习在非IID设置下的公平性和整体性能，为处理客户端异构性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

Result: 在四个医疗中心收集的iEEG记录上实现了竞争性的分类性能，同时为从业者提供了更高的透明度和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法在可靠和可解释的临床变长时间序列分类方面具有潜力，特别适用于iEEG分析。

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

Conclusion: 本文为风险感知持续强化学习建立了理论基础，提出的遍历风险度量解决了经典风险度量在持续设置中的局限性，为智能体在不确定环境中进行终身学习提供了新工具。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

Abstract: Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is
fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue
changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and
response to treatment. We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow
matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of
structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically,
ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor
communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes
the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints,
ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent
but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics
data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and
qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence. Our code is

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

Conclusion: 该框架适用于行为分析和风险感知模仿学习，能够捕捉专家行为中的丰富结构并实现优越的模仿性能。

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic
simulations at scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZeroShotOpt是一个通过离线强化学习预训练的通用黑盒优化模型，在2D到20D的连续优化任务中实现零样本泛化，性能优于传统贝叶斯优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化(BO)的性能依赖于需要手动调整的超参数，且难以在不同问题场景中泛化。为解决这一问题，作者提出了预训练优化模型的方法。

Method: 使用12种BO变体收集大规模优化轨迹，通过离线强化学习在数百万个合成高斯过程函数上进行预训练，学习可迁移的优化策略。

Result: ZeroShotOpt在多种未见基准测试中实现了稳健的零样本泛化，匹配或超越了包括BO在内的领先全局优化器的样本效率。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可重用的优化基础，为未来扩展和改进奠定了基础，代码、数据集和模型均已开源。

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model
are available at: https://github.com/jamisonmeindl/zeroshotopt

Result: PAGAC在所有算法中表现最优，在Platform游戏中完成5000回合仅需41:24，在Robot Soccer Goal游戏中仅需24:04，获得了最高的回报和最快的训练速度。

Conclusion: PAGAC在复杂动作空间中具有速度和稳定性优势，是快速收敛和鲁棒性能任务的理想选择。未来可探索熵正则化与截断方法的混合策略。

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Soft Actor Critic (SAC), Greedy Actor
Critic (GAC), and Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC) in high-dimensional
decision-making tasks using fully observable environments. The focus is on
parametrized action (PA) spaces, eliminating the need for recurrent networks,
with benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 testing discrete actions linked to
continuous action-parameter spaces. Hyperparameter optimization was performed
with Microsoft NNI, ensuring reproducibility by modifying the codebase for GAC
and TQC. Results show that Parameterized Action Greedy Actor-Critic (PAGAC)
outperformed other algorithms, achieving the fastest training times and highest
returns across benchmarks, completing 5,000 episodes in 41:24 for the Platform
game and 24:04 for the Robot Soccer Goal game. Its speed and stability provide
clear advantages in complex action spaces. Compared to PASAC and PATQC, PAGAC
demonstrated superior efficiency and reliability, making it ideal for tasks
requiring rapid convergence and robust performance. Future work could explore
hybrid strategies combining entropy-regularization with truncation-based
methods to enhance stability and expand investigations into generalizability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的双解码器深度强化学习框架UD3RL来解决接近旅行商问题，将决策分为节点选择和路径点确定两个子任务，在解质量和运行时间上都优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习在旅行商问题上取得了进展，但针对接近旅行商问题的研究较少，主要挑战在于其基于邻域的访问标准，即只要进入节点的紧凑邻域即视为访问。

Method: 使用离散化方案构建马尔可夫决策过程，提出UD3RL框架，包含特征提取编码器、节点解码器和位置解码器，并引入k近邻子图交互策略增强空间推理能力。

Result: UD3RL在解质量和运行时间上都优于传统方法，在不同问题规模、空间分布和半径范围内表现出强泛化能力，对动态环境具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UD3RL是一个有效的统一模型，能够泛化到不同问题规模和邻域半径类型，为接近旅行商问题提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

*Marc Lelarge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于图对齐问题的链式GNN方法，通过训练一系列GNN网络迭代优化相似度矩阵，在推理时产生自举效应，大幅提升了图对齐的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络在组合优化问题上难以超越传统优化方法，限制了其实际应用价值。图对齐作为基础的NP难问题，需要找到仅基于结构信息的节点对应关系。

Method: 训练一系列GNN网络，每个网络学习迭代优化前一个网络产生的相似度矩阵。结合在节点对上操作而非单个节点上的强大架构，捕获标准消息传递网络无法表示的全局结构模式。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，链式GNN比现有方法准确率提高3倍以上，在规则图上唯一成功解决而其他方法均失败。与传统优化后处理结合后，在图对齐基准上显著优于最先进的求解器。

Conclusion: 链式GNN方法通过迭代精化和自举效应，成功克服了GNN在组合优化问题上的局限性，为图对齐问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

*Ali Azizpour,Madeline Navarro,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于图神经网络的自适应节点特征选择方法，通过在训练期间识别和移除不必要的特征来提高模型性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构数据引入了复杂的依赖关系，传统特征重要性度量方法可能不适用，需要开发能够衡量特征对模型输出贡献的方法来提升模型可解释性、降低维度甚至改善性能。

Method: 基于干预的方法，在训练过程中通过置换特征值后验证性能的变化来确定相关特征，该方法与模型和任务无关，能够跟踪特征相关性的演化过程。

Result: 经验结果验证了该方法对不同图架构的灵活性以及对更具挑战性的图学习环境的适应性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅能在训练结束时返回特征重要性评分，还能跟踪特征被逐步移除时相关性的演化，有效监控特征消除过程并评估其他指标。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

*Irene Tenison,Soumyajit Chatterjee,Fahim Kawsar,Mohammad Malekzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaBet是一种无需梯度的层选择方法，通过分析激活空间的拓扑特征来识别重要层，用于在边缘设备上进行高效的重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘和移动设备上使用预训练神经网络时，需要高效适应用户特定的运行时数据分布，但受限于计算和内存资源。现有方法依赖标记数据、完整反向传播或服务器端元训练，不适合受限设备。

Method: AdaBet通过Betti数分析激活空间的拓扑特征，仅使用前向传播来对重要层进行排序，无需标签或梯度。

Result: 在16对基准模型和数据集上的评估显示，AdaBet比基于梯度的基线方法平均分类准确率提高5%，同时平均峰值内存消耗减少40%。

Conclusion: AdaBet提供了一种无需梯度的高效层选择方法，适用于资源受限的边缘设备上的神经网络重训练。

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

Motivation: 提高城市地铁系统的实时调度效率，确保服务可靠性、最大化资源利用率和提升乘客满意度，避免计算密集型模拟。

Conclusion: 该框架为铁路运营商提供了强大且计算高效的工具，可优化调度策略，显著改善服务一致性和乘客满意度。

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

Conclusion: 投资组合感知的目标和几何感知的归纳偏置对于机器学习系统中的风险感知资本配置至关重要。

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

Motivation: 现有测试时算法结合语言模型和过程验证器时，验证器的微小错误可能导致生成过程中的灾难性失败，需要更鲁棒的解码策略。

Conclusion: VGB算法通过理论基础的随机游走和回溯机制，显著提高了对验证器错误的鲁棒性，为过程引导推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

Conclusion: 混合专家模型学习中近似误差与估计误差的权衡取决于专家数量，为MoE模型的理论分析提供了新的视角。

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

Conclusion: 通过考虑模型校准误差的主动学习方法能有效提升深度神经网络在主动学习中的性能，降低校准误差和泛化误差。

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

Motivation: 联邦学习在资源受限的边缘节点部署面临内存、能耗和通信带宽限制，传统同步和异步方法在异构大规模网络中受到慢客户端延迟和收敛缓慢的困扰。

Method: 采用半异步联邦学习框架，结合稀疏参数更新和基于更新年龄与方差的陈旧度加权聚合机制。

Conclusion: FTTE是首个适用于异构且主要资源受限边缘设备的实用且可扩展的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: 提出Density-QUCB算法，使用转移密度函数检测分布漂移，并利用其似然增强Q-learning UCB的不确定性估计质量。

Result: 理论证明DQUCB比QUCB具有更好的遗憾保证，实验表明在RL任务和COVID-19患者医院分配任务中DQUCB具有更低遗憾和计算效率。

Conclusion: DQUCB算法能有效检测分布漂移，在非平稳强化学习环境中实现更好的性能，兼具模型无关RL的计算效率优势。

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution
shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了叠加现象如何影响神经网络对齐度量，发现不同叠加排列会降低对齐分数，而通过稀疏自编码器解耦叠加可以揭示真实的表征对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究叠加现象是否会影响神经网络对齐度量的准确性，特别是当模型以不同的叠加排列表示相同特征时，是否会干扰预测映射度量。

Method: 开发了关于严格排列度量依赖叠加排列的理论，通过训练稀疏自编码器在玩具模型中解耦叠加，并测试DNN→DNN和DNN→大脑线性回归对齐。

Result: 当用稀疏过完备潜在代码替换基础神经元时，对齐分数通常会增加，在视觉领域的DNN→DNN和DNN→大脑线性回归对齐中也观察到类似增长。

Conclusion: 叠加解耦对于映射度量揭示神经编码之间真实表征对齐是必要的。

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习和可穿戴传感器数据估计单臂哑铃弯举时的主观疲劳程度(RPE)，随机森林分类器表现最佳，准确率达41.4%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计主观疲劳程度可以增强抗阻训练效果，通过个性化反馈和预防损伤

Method: 收集69组超过1000次重复的惯性传感器和肌电图数据，提取统计特征训练机器学习模型

Result: 随机森林分类器表现最佳，精确准确率41.4%，±1 RPE准确率85.9%；离心重复时间是最强的RPE预测因子

Conclusion: 证明了基于可穿戴传感器的RPE估计可行性，并确定了提高模型泛化能力的关键挑战

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance
resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This
study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE
during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and
electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在部分可观测环境中，特权专家蒸馏与标准强化学习之间的权衡，发现潜在动态的随机性是该权衡的关键因素，且最优潜在策略并不总是最佳蒸馏对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分可观测性是强化学习中的主要挑战，需要学习复杂的历史依赖策略。特权专家蒸馏利用训练期间的潜在状态信息来学习最优马尔可夫策略，但存在已知的失败模式，需要系统研究其与标准RL的权衡。

Method: 通过理论模型（扰动块MDP）和模拟运动任务的受控实验，对比特权专家蒸馏与无特权信息的标准RL方法。

Result: 实验表明该权衡取决于潜在动态的随机性，与理论预测一致；同时发现最优潜在策略并不总是最佳蒸馏对象。

Conclusion: 研究结果为有效利用特权信息提供了新指导原则，有望提升部分可观测领域中策略学习的效率。

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了低概率正则化(Lp-Reg)方法，通过保护推理火花(reasoning sparks)来解决RLVR训练中的探索退化问题，在数学推理任务上实现了60.17%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在训练过程中会出现性能平台期，原因是策略熵崩溃导致探索能力丧失。传统方法简单地维持高熵策略，但未能有效保护有价值的低概率探索性token。

Method: 提出Lp-Reg方法，通过构建启发式代理分布来正则化策略。该代理分布通过过滤噪声token并重新归一化剩余候选token的概率来增强推理火花的概率，然后作为软正则化目标保护这些有价值的token。

Result: Lp-Reg能够实现约1000步的稳定在线训练，而基线熵控制方法会崩溃。在五个数学基准测试上达到60.17%的平均准确率，比先前方法提升2.66%。

Conclusion: 保护推理火花对于RLVR的持续探索至关重要，Lp-Reg通过低概率正则化有效解决了探索退化问题，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

Conclusion: 本文为时间序列中的预测推断方法提供了理论分析工具，特别适用于具有记忆的预测器，并提出了衡量时间依赖性影响的新指标。

Abstract: We consider the problem of uncertainty quantification for prediction in a
time series: if we use past data to forecast the next time point, can we
provide valid prediction intervals around our forecasts? To avoid placing
distributional assumptions on the data, in recent years the conformal
prediction method has been a popular approach for predictive inference, since
it provides distribution-free coverage for any iid or exchangeable data
distribution. However, in the time series setting, the strong empirical
performance of conformal prediction methods is not well understood, since even
short-range temporal dependence is a strong violation of the exchangeability
assumption. Using predictors with "memory" -- i.e., predictors that utilize
past observations, such as autoregressive models -- further exacerbates this
problem. In this work, we examine the theoretical properties of split conformal
prediction in the time series setting, including the case where predictors may
have memory. Our results bound the loss of coverage of these methods in terms
of a new "switch coefficient", measuring the extent to which temporal
dependence within the time series creates violations of exchangeability. Our
characterization of the coverage probability is sharp over the class of
stationary, $\beta$-mixing processes. Along the way, we introduce tools that
may prove useful in analyzing other predictive inference methods for dependent
data.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks with
widespread applications across machine learning and artificial intelligence
systems. While current research has predominantly focused on linear diffusions,
these approaches can face significant challenges when modeling a conditional
distribution, $P(Y|X=x)$, when $P(X=x)$ is small. In these regions, few
samples, if any, are available for training, thus modeling the corresponding
conditional density may be difficult. Recognizing this, we show it is possible
to adapt the data representation and forward scheme so that the sample
complexity of learning a score-based generative model is small in low
probability regions of the conditioning space. Drawing inspiration from
conditional extreme value theory we characterize this method precisely in the
special case in the tail regions of the conditioning variable, $X$. We show how
diffusion with a data-driven choice of nonlinear drift term is best suited to
model tail events under an appropriate representation of the data. Through
empirical validation on two synthetic datasets and a real-world financial
dataset, we demonstrate that our tail-adaptive approach significantly
outperforms standard diffusion models in accurately capturing response
distributions at the extreme tail conditions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in high-dimensional problems, outperforming models
such as kernel methods, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality. However,
the theoretical foundations of this success remain poorly understood. We follow
the idea that the compositional structure of the learning task is the key
factor determining when deep networks outperform other approaches. Taking a
step towards formalizing this idea, we consider a simple compositional model,
namely the multi-index model (MIM). In this context, we introduce and study
hyper-kernel ridge regression (HKRR), an approach blending neural networks and
kernel methods. Our main contribution is a sample complexity result
demonstrating that HKRR can adaptively learn MIM, overcoming the curse of
dimensionality. Further, we exploit the kernel nature of the estimator to
develop ad hoc optimization approaches. Indeed, we contrast alternating
minimization and alternating gradient methods both theoretically and
numerically. These numerical results complement and reinforce our theoretical
findings.

Conclusion: NJODE为伊藤过程提供了一种无需对抗训练的生成建模方法，能有效处理现实世界中的不规则采样和路径依赖问题。

Abstract: In this work, we explore how Neural Jump ODEs (NJODEs) can be used as
generative models for It\^o processes. Given (discrete observations of) samples
of a fixed underlying It\^o process, the NJODE framework can be used to
approximate the drift and diffusion coefficients of the process. Under standard
regularity assumptions on the It\^o processes, we prove that, in the limit, we
recover the true parameters with our approximation. Hence, using these learned
coefficients to sample from the corresponding It\^o process generates, in the
limit, samples with the same law as the true underlying process. Compared to
other generative machine learning models, our approach has the advantage that
it does not need adversarial training and can be trained solely as a predictive
model on the observed samples without the need to generate any samples during
training to empirically approximate the distribution. Moreover, the NJODE
framework naturally deals with irregularly sampled data with missing values as
well as with path-dependent dynamics, allowing to apply this approach in
real-world settings. In particular, in the case of path-dependent coefficients
of the It\^o processes, the NJODE learns their optimal approximation given the
past observations and therefore allows generating new paths conditionally on
discrete, irregular, and incomplete past observations in an optimal way.
