We study this problem under an additional constraint of\nDifferential Privacy, where the agent needs to ensure that the sequence of\nquery points is differentially private with respect to both the sequence of\ncontexts and rewards. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves the\nstate-of-the-art cumulative regret of\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{\\gamma_TT}+\\frac{\\gamma_T}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{DP}}})$\nand\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{\\gamma_TT}+\\frac{\\gamma_T\\sqrt{T}}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{DP}}})$\nover a time horizon of $T$ in the joint and local models of differential\nprivacy, respectively, where $\\gamma_T$ is the effective dimension of the\nkernel and $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{DP}} > 0$ is the privacy parameter. The key\ningredient of the proposed algorithm is a novel private kernel-ridge regression\nestimator which is based on a combination of private covariance estimation and\nprivate random projections. It offers a significantly reduced sensitivity\ncompared to its classical counterpart while maintaining a high prediction\naccuracy, allowing our algorithm to achieve the state-of-the-art performance\nguarantees."}

Vejling", "Shashi Raj Pandey", "Christophe A. N. Biscio", "Petar Popovski"], "title": "Conformal Data Contamination Tests for Trading or Sharing of Data", "comment": null, "summary": "The amount of quality data in many machine learning tasks is limited to what\nis available locally to data owners. The set of quality data can be expanded\nthrough trading or sharing with external data agents. However, data buyers need\nquality guarantees before purchasing, as external data may be contaminated or\nirrelevant to their specific learning task. Previous works primarily rely on\ndistributional assumptions about data from different agents, relegating quality\nchecks to post-hoc steps involving costly data valuation procedures. We propose\na distribution-free, contamination-aware data-sharing framework that identifies\nexternal data agents whose data is most valuable for model personalization. To\nachieve this, we introduce novel two-sample testing procedures, grounded in\nrigorous theoretical foundations for conformal outlier detection, to determine\nwhether an agent's data exceeds a contamination threshold. The proposed tests,\ntermed conformal data contamination tests, remain valid under arbitrary\ncontamination levels while enabling false discovery rate control via the\nBenjamini-Hochberg procedure. Empirical evaluations across diverse\ncollaborative learning scenarios demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness\nof our approach. Overall, the conformal data contamination test distinguishes\nitself as a generic procedure for aggregating data with statistically rigorous\nquality guarantees."}

In many instances it is important to understand the real dimension\nof the data, hence the complexity of the dataset at hand. A great variety of\ndimension estimators have been developed to find the intrinsic dimension of the\ndata but there is little guidance on how to reliably use these estimators.\n  This survey reviews a wide range of dimension estimation methods,\ncategorising them by the geometric information they exploit: tangential\nestimators which detect a local affine structure; parametric estimators which\nrely on dimension-dependent probability distributions; and estimators which use\ntopological or metric invariants.\n  The paper evaluates the performance of these methods, as well as\ninvestigating varying responses to curvature and noise. Key issues addressed\ninclude robustness to hyperparameter selection, sample size requirements,\naccuracy in high dimensions, precision, and performance on non-linear\ngeometries. In identifying the best hyperparameters for benchmark datasets,\noverfitting is frequent, indicating that many estimators may not generalise\nwell beyond the datasets on which they have been tested."}

A central challenge in this setting is predicting a\nresponse associated with a new covariate value. Most of the existing\nstatistical and machine learning literature has focused either on point\nprediction of bounded outcomes or on interval prediction based on asymptotic\napproximations. We develop conformal prediction intervals for bounded outcomes\nbased on transformation models and beta regression. We introduce tailored\nnon-conformity measures based on residuals that are aligned with the underlying\nmodels, and account for the inherent heteroscedasticity in regression settings\nwith bounded outcomes. We present a theoretical result on asymptotic marginal\nand conditional validity in the context of full conformal prediction, which\nremains valid under model misspecification. For split conformal prediction, we\nprovide an empirical coverage analysis based on a comprehensive simulation\nstudy. The simulation study demonstrates that both methods provide valid\nfinite-sample predictive coverage, including settings with model\nmisspecification. Finally, we demonstrate the practical performance of the\nproposed conformal prediction intervals on real data and compare them with\nbootstrap-based alternatives."}

Like existing,\nfully amortized, policy-based BED approaches, Step-DAD trains a design policy\nupfront before the experiment. However, rather than keeping this policy fixed,\nStep-DAD periodically updates it as data is gathered, refining it to the\nparticular experimental instance. This test-time adaptation improves both the\nflexibility and the robustness of the design strategy compared with existing\napproaches. Empirically, Step-DAD consistently demonstrates superior\ndecision-making and robustness compared with current state-of-the-art BED\nmethods."}
