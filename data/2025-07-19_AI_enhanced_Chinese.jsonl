The channel when viewed in the DD domain is\npredictable. However, even with Zak-OTFS, pilots need to be sent periodically,\nalbeit at a lower rate. In this paper, we propose a differential communication\nscheme for Zak-OTFS systems that alleviates the need for periodic pilot\ntransmission. Towards this, we analytically show that the detected data can be\nused as a pilot and that the channel estimate obtained from the detected data\ncan enable further detection enabling the \"differential\" aspect of the\ncommunication. Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD\nchannel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data\nsymbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next\ninstant and propagate this forward. The advantages are two fold. First, it\nallows the data symbols to enjoy higher energy since the energy that would\notherwise be required for pilot symbols can also be allocated to data symbols.\nSecond, it allows for full spectral efficiency compared to point or embedded\npilots.

Despite advances in\nmulti-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures\nthat effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different\nphysiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in\nmany biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional\nmethods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified\ndeep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across\ndifferent signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an\nattention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:\ntime-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to\ngenerate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase\nsignal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in\nthe best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps\nincluded wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class\nimbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced\ndata augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were\napplied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the\nproposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH\nArrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,\nand 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types\nand clinical contexts.

DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift.

Using a\nstate-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22%\nand 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3)\nrespectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with\nearlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement\nholds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also\nyields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary\nfor maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs,\nand using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a\nfact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast\nmodels. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market\nparticipants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within\nincreasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5e02\u573a\u5173\u95f8\u65f6\u95f4\uff08GCT\uff09\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u7535\u4ef7\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u4ef7\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u6bd4\u5229\u65f6\u548c\u745e\u5178\u5e02\u573a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8622%\u548c9%\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u77ed\u671f\u7535\u4ef7\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u8c03\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u5f02\u6b65\u7535\u4ef7\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5fb7\u56fd-\u5362\u68ee\u5821\u3001\u5965\u5730\u5229\u548c\u745e\u58eb\u7b49\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u7535\u4ef7\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6bd4\u5229\u65f6\u548c\u745e\u5178\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534722%\u548c9%\uff0c\u4f46\u9891\u7e41\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e14\u5e76\u975e\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u603b\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6b27\u6d32\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7ade\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Its attractiveness stems from\nleveraging existing lighting infrastructures equipped with light-emitting\ndiodes (LEDs), enabling cost-efficient deployments and achieving high-precision\npositioning accuracy in the centimeter-todecimeter range. However, widespread\nadoption of traditional VLP solutions faces significant barriers due to the\nincreased costs and operational complexity associated with modulating LEDs,\nwhich consequently reduces illumination efficiency by lowering their radiant\nflux.

Existing DCT methods\nmainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete\none-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their\napplications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of\ndata, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful\nmeasurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex\ndistributions, into DCT scenarios.

To mitigate the\nissue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive\nMMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.\nBased on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the\nNAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.\nTheoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to\nMMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive\nexperiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).\nFurthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample\ntesting problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than\nthe MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u63a5\u8fd1\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5NAMMD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408RKHS\u8303\u6570\u6539\u8fdbMMD\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DCT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u4e00\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u4e14MMD\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1NAMMD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RKHS\u8303\u6570\u7f29\u653eMMD\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5176\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u51faNAMMD-based DCT\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eNAMMD-based DCT\u6bd4MMD-based DCT\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NAMMD\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8eDCT\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u4e24\u6837\u672c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eMMD\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Our\ninfrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated\nCross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on\nPinterest internal data.

NTKs typically actively change during\ntraining and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on\nGradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in\nwhich the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely\nproportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored\nthe underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the\nunderstanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still\nmissing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in\ndetail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates\ncause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK\nmatrix, to have greater alignment with the training target.

To address this,\nwe first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding\npolicy ($\\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the\ntraining of the target policy ($\\pion$). This approach improves training\nstability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size.\nSecondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are\noften discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these\nsamples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance\nsample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods,\ndemonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution\nwithin the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning.

However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying\nlayer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence\nof graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This\nwork revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir\nGraph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a\nvariant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of\nsurface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band\nspectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted\nto the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral\nformulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks\nwhere smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph\nclassification.

This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract\nmulti-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration\nsignal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long\nShort-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network\neffectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement\nspeeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal\ndependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors\nfor health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a\nsequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,\ncapturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.\nThis architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of\ninfrastructure health conditions.

At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide\nrange of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,\ntraining generative models typically requires large datasets and significant\ncomputational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.\nAcquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many\nunderutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying\ncapabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due\nto privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling\nto share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach\nfor decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data\nand underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw\nform. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized\nenvironments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address\nthe issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous\nU-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under\nstrict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether\nreal or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes.

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent\nrelations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nKGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such\nas translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These\ngeometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific\nstructural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs\nby KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific\ntransformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by\nensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite\nversion of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent\nall the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how\nwell each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this\nranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each\nrelation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply\nacross all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT\nin low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we\nuse the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low\ndimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space.

However, it is highly\nsusceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which\nlead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG\nlearning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer\nknowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.\nNevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label\nmisalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual\nfeature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create\ndiscrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper\naddresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined\nlabels.

To explore this gap, we\nbegin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for\nmaintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able\nto train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.\nWe find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves\nstandard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models\nto reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's\nupdate having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method\nthat improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter\ntransformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches\nvalidation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz\ntransformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the\nNanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound\nincreases to 10^264. Nonetheless, our Lipschitz transformers train without\nstability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7Lipschitz\u7ea6\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u73b0\u4ee3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982Transformer\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u6270\u52a8\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d1\u6563\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709Lipschitz\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982Transformer\uff09\u7684\u5168\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u7ea6\u675f\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5668Muon\u6539\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u6743\u91cd\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347Lipschitz\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bad\u7ec32-Lipschitz Transformer\uff08Shakespeare\u6587\u672c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u738760%\uff09\u548c10-Lipschitz Transformer\uff08\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u6587\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u738721%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5339\u914d\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u9700\u653e\u5bbdLipschitz\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "Lipschitz\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9700\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}
