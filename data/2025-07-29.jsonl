As a\nresult, simulated behavior is oftentimes computationally expensive. In an\nincreasingly data-driven world, the usage of efficient data-driven design\nschemes is a popular choice. Among them, Bayesian optimization (BO) with\nGaussian process regression is one of the most important representatives. The\nauthors argue that computational savings can be obtained from exploiting\nthorough surrogate modeling and selecting a design candidate based on multiple\nacquisition functions. This is feasible due to the relatively low computational\ncost, compared to the expensive simulation objective. This paper addresses the\nshortcomings in the adjacent literature by providing and implementing a novel\nheuristic framework to perform BO with adaptive hyperparameters across the\nvarious optimization iterations. Adaptive BO is subsequently compared to\nregular BO when faced with synthetic objective minimization problems. The\nresults show the efficiency of adaptive BO when compared any worst-performing\nregular Bayesian schemes.

We\nconducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings\nfrom ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that\nProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large\ndatasets.

Although notable progress has been made in this area, a\nunified framework for systematically organizing and integrating existing work\nis still lacking. The substantial differences among current studies in terms of\nunlearning objectives and evaluation protocols hinder the objective and fair\ncomparison of various approaches. While some studies focus on specific types of\ngenerative models, they often overlook the commonalities and systematic\ncharacteristics inherent in Generative Model Unlearning (GenMU). To bridge this\ngap, we provide a comprehensive review of current research on GenMU and propose\na unified analytical framework for categorizing unlearning objectives,\nmethodological strategies, and evaluation metrics. In addition, we explore the\nconnections between GenMU and related techniques, including model editing,\nreinforcement learning from human feedback, and controllable generation.

Second-order methods, which use curvature\ninformation from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are\ncomputationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order\ntechnique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry\nof a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only\ngradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for\nlocating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel\nframework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the\nDimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating\nthe Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By\nperiodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the\nminimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points\nand flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.\nPreliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves\ncompetitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving\nnavigation of complex loss landscapes.

Although some attempts address this by designing more\nsophisticated aggregation functions, these methods tend to rely heavily on\nlabeled data, which is often scarce in real-world tasks. In this work, we\npropose a novel unsupervised framework, \"Aggregation-aware Multilayer\nPerceptron\" (AMLP), which shifts the paradigm from directly crafting\naggregation functions to making MLP adaptive to aggregation. Our lightweight\napproach consists of two key steps: First, we utilize a graph reconstruction\nmethod that facilitates high-order grouping effects, and second, we employ a\nsingle-layer network to encode varying degrees of heterophily, thereby\nimproving the capacity and applicability of the model.

Previous PDA works managed to correct the\nlabel distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,\nthe simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and\nsufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on\nthe source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based\nshift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a\nbuilt sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as\nthe target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of the model.

In this paper, we introduce a non-linear method based on neural\nnetworks combining simulation and measurement data via transfer learning. The\nnetwork training accounts for the heterogeneity of the data, as simulation data\nusually features a high spatial resolution, while measurement data is sparse\nbut more accurate. In a first step, the neural network is trained on simulation\ndata to learn spatial features of the distributed quantities.

Project page:\n  https://jacky1128.github.io/RepMTL/", "summary": "Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary\nknowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques\nremain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and\ngradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this\npaper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions\nnaturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations\ncomplementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the\ninter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition\nleads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to\nquantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared\nrepresentation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based\npenalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate\nnegative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks\ninstead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary\ninformation sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL\nbenchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results\nshow that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves\ncompetitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard\nperformance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's\nefficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing.

FPO\ncasts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed\nfrom the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the\npopular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood\ncomputation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models.\nUnlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind\ntraining to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of\ndiffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that\nFPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous\ncontrol tasks.

As a\nresult, simulated behavior is oftentimes computationally expensive. In an\nincreasingly data-driven world, the usage of efficient data-driven design\nschemes is a popular choice. Among them, Bayesian optimization (BO) with\nGaussian process regression is one of the most important representatives. The\nauthors argue that computational savings can be obtained from exploiting\nthorough surrogate modeling and selecting a design candidate based on multiple\nacquisition functions. This is feasible due to the relatively low computational\ncost, compared to the expensive simulation objective. This paper addresses the\nshortcomings in the adjacent literature by providing and implementing a novel\nheuristic framework to perform BO with adaptive hyperparameters across the\nvarious optimization iterations. Adaptive BO is subsequently compared to\nregular BO when faced with synthetic objective minimization problems. The\nresults show the efficiency of adaptive BO when compared any worst-performing\nregular Bayesian schemes. As an engineering use case, the solder joint\nreliability problem is tackled by minimizing the accumulated non-linear creep\nstrain under a cyclic thermal load. Results show that adaptive BO outperforms\nregular BO by 3% on average at any given computational budget threshold,\ncritically saving half of the computational expense budget.

The BoC test reframes confidence estimation as a\nfrequentist hypothesis test: does the model's top-ranked class win 1-v-1\ncontests against random competitors at a rate consistent with its own stated\nsoftmax probability? When applied to modern deep learning architectures, this\nsimple probe reveals a fundamental dichotomy.
