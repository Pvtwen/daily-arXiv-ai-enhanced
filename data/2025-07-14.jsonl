Moreover,\npatient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data\nacross institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which\nrely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study\nproposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving\nmechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection\nin diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient\ndescent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises\nfrom insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for\nneural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient\nleakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is\nintegrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local\ndata, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the\nimpracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across\nvarious medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to\naggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the\nadaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of\ndifferential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using\ndata from different structures, categories, and distributions."}

Notably, most interpretability\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\naccuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:\ncausal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it\nbecomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.\nStudying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal\nabstraction should lead to exciting future work."}

Under this model, observed rankings are noisy\nperturbations of a central ranking $\\sigma$, with likelihood decaying\nexponentially in distance from $\\sigma$, i.e, $P (\\pi) \\propto \\exp\\big(-\\beta\n\\cdot d(\\pi, \\sigma)\\big),$ where $\\beta > 0$ controls dispersion and $d$ is a\ndistance function.\n  Existing methods mainly focus on fixed distances (such as Kendall's $\\tau$\ndistance), with no principled approach to learning the distance metric directly\nfrom data. In practice, however, rankings naturally vary by context; for\ninstance, in some sports we regularly see long-range swaps (a low-rank team\nbeating a high-rank one), while in others such events are rare. Motivated by\nthis, we propose a generalization of Mallows model that learns the distance\nmetric directly from data. Specifically, we focus on $L_\\alpha$ distances:\n$d_\\alpha(\\pi,\\sigma):=\\sum_{i=1} |\\pi(i)-\\sigma(i)|^\\alpha$.\n  For any $\\alpha\\geq 1$ and $\\beta>0$, we develop a Fully Polynomial-Time\nApproximation Scheme (FPTAS) to efficiently generate samples that are\n$\\epsilon$- close (in total variation distance) to the true distribution. Even\nin the special cases of $L_1$ and $L_2$, this generalizes prior results that\nrequired vanishing dispersion ($\\beta\\to0$). Using this sampling algorithm, we\npropose an efficient Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm that jointly\nestimates the central ranking, the dispersion parameter, and the optimal\ndistance metric. We prove strong consistency results for our estimators (for\nany values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$), and we validate our approach empirically\nusing datasets from sports rankings."}

Since these statistics are being estimated across the feature\nmaps within a batch, this problem is ideally suited for the application of\nStein's shrinkage estimation, which leads to a better, in the\nmean-squared-error sense, estimate of the mean and variance of the batch. In\nthis paper, we prove that the Stein shrinkage estimator for the mean and\nvariance dominates over the sample mean and variance estimators in the presence\nof adversarial attacks when modeling these attacks using sub-Gaussian\ndistributions. This facilitates and justifies the application of Stein\nshrinkage to estimate the mean and variance parameters in BN and use it in\nimage classification (segmentation) tasks with and without adversarial attacks.\nWe present SOTA performance results using this Stein corrected batch norm in a\nstandard ResNet architecture applied to the task of image classification using\nCIFAR-10 data, 3D CNN on PPMI (neuroimaging) data and image segmentation using\nHRNet on Cityscape data with and without adversarial attacks."}

In this study, we propose\na novel deep learning framework designed to address such shifts in missingness\ndistributions. We begin by introducing a set of mutual information-based\nconditions, called MI robustness conditions, which guide a prediction model to\nextract label-relevant information while remaining invariant to diverse\nmissingness patterns, thereby enhancing robustness to unseen missingness\nscenarios at test-time. To make these conditions practical, we propose simple\nyet effective techniques to derive loss terms corresponding to each and\nformulate a final objective function, termed MIRRAMS(Mutual Information\nRegularization for Robustness Against Missingness Shifts). As a by-product, our\nanalysis provides a theoretical interpretation of the principles underlying\nconsistency regularization-based semi-supervised learning methods, such as\nFixMatch. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets show that\nMIRRAMS consistently outperforms existing baselines and maintains stable\nperformance across diverse missingness scenarios. Moreover, our approach\nachieves state-of-the-art performance even without missing data and can be\nnaturally extended to address semi-supervised learning tasks, highlighting\nMIRRAMS as a powerful, off-the-shelf framework for general-purpose learning."}

The halfspace depth was the first depth to aim at generalising\nthe notion of quantile beyond the univariate case. Among the existing variety\nof depth definitions, it remains one of the most used notions of data depth.\nTaking a different angle from the quantile point of view, we show that the\nhalfspace depth can also be regarded as the minimum loss of a set of\nclassifiers for a specific labelling of the points. By changing the loss or the\nset of classifiers considered, this new angle naturally leads to a family of\n\"loss depths\", extending to well-studied classifiers such as, e.g., SVM or\nlogistic regression, among others. This framework directly inherits\ncomputational efficiency of existing machine learning algorithms as well as\ntheir fast statistical convergence rates, and opens the data depth realm to the\nhigh-dimensional setting. Furthermore, the new loss depths highlight a\nconnection between the dataset and the right amount of complexity or simplicity\nof the classifiers. The simplicity of classifiers as well as the interpretation\nas a risk makes our new kind of data depth easy to explain, yet efficient for\nanomaly detection, as is shown by experiments."}
