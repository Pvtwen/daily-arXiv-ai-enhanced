*Mohammad Mehedi Hasan,Pedro G. Lind,Hernando Ombao,Anis Yazidi,Rabindra Khadka*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于EEG微状态分析的智力衰退诊断框架EEG-MSAF，通过自动化特征提取、机器学习分类和SHAP特征排名，在两个数据集上实现了高准确率和良好的可推广性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智力衰退是全球急需解决的健康挑战，需要早期准确诊断。传统EEG方法难以抓取脑电活动的过渡复杂性，需要更有效的分析框架。

Method: 设计了结构化的EEG微状态分析框架(EEG-MSAF)，包含三个阶段：自动化微状态特征提取、机器学习分类、以及使用SHAP进行特征排名来确认关键生物标记。

Result: 在CAUEEG数据集上达到89%准确率，超过深度学习基准CEEDNET 19.3%；在Thessaloniki数据集上达到95%准确率，与EEGConvNeXt相当。SHAP分析确定平均相关性和出现频率是最关键的指标。

Conclusion: EEG-MSAF框架通过结合高准确性、良好可推广性和可解释性，推进了基于EEG的智力衰退诊断，并揭示了认知过程中的脑动态机制。

Abstract: Dementia (DEM) is a growing global health challenge, underscoring the need
for early and accurate diagnosis. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a
non-invasive window into brain activity, but conventional methods struggle to
capture its transient complexity. We present the \textbf{EEG Microstate
Analysis Framework (EEG-MSAF)}, an end-to-end pipeline that leverages EEG
microstates discrete, quasi-stable topographies to identify DEM-related
biomarkers and distinguish DEM, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal
cognition (NC). EEG-MSAF comprises three stages: (1) automated microstate
feature extraction, (2) classification with machine learning (ML), and (3)
feature ranking using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to highlight key
biomarkers. We evaluate on two EEG datasets: the public Chung-Ang University
EEG (CAUEEG) dataset and a clinical cohort from Thessaloniki Hospital. Our
framework demonstrates strong performance and generalizability. On CAUEEG,
EEG-MSAF-SVM achieves \textbf{89\% $\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, surpassing the deep
learning baseline CEEDNET by \textbf{19.3\%}. On the Thessaloniki dataset, it
reaches \textbf{95\% $\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, comparable to EEGConvNeXt. SHAP
analysis identifies mean correlation and occurrence as the most informative
metrics: disruption of microstate C (salience/attention network) dominates DEM
prediction, while microstate F, a novel default-mode pattern, emerges as a key
early biomarker for both MCI and DEM. By combining accuracy, generalizability,
and interpretability, EEG-MSAF advances EEG-based dementia diagnosis and sheds
light on brain dynamics across the cognitive spectrum.

### [3] [minPIC: Towards Optimal Power Allocation in Multi-User Interference Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02797)
*Sagnik Bhattacharya,Abhiram Rao Gorle,John M. Cioffi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: minPIC框架：6G无蜂窝网络中针对多用户干扰信道的最优功率、子载波和解码顺序分配方法，通过双变量排序准则和凸优化实现帕累托边界


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G大规模无蜂窝网络需要解决空间嵌套多址接入和广播信道的资源分配问题，现有OMA、NOMA和RSMA方案依赖固定启发式方法，导致速率次优、功率效率低下和可扩展性问题

Method: 提出minPIC框架，引入双变量引导的排序准则识别全局最优SIC顺序，然后通过带有辅助对数行列式约束的凸优化进行求解，采用二分搜索高效实现

Result: minPIC能够实现高斯干扰信道SIC可达速率区域的帕累托边界，有望满足沉浸式XR等6G应用的高速率、低功耗要求

Conclusion: minPIC是首个算法实现高斯干扰信道SIC可达速率区域帕累托边界的方法，为无蜂窝网络的可扩展干扰管理开辟了新途径

Abstract: 6G envisions massive cell-free networks with spatially nested multiple access
(MAC) and broadcast (BC) channels without centralized coordination. This makes
optimal resource allocation across power, subcarriers, and decoding orders
crucial for interference channels (ICs), where neither transmitters nor
receivers can cooperate. Current orthogonal multiple access (OMA) methods, as
well as non-orthogonal (NOMA) and rate-splitting (RSMA) schemes, rely on fixed
heuristics for interference management, leading to suboptimal rates, power
inefficiency, and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel minPIC
framework for optimal power, subcarrier, and decoding order allocation in
general multi-user ICs. Unlike existing methods, minPIC eliminates heuristic
SIC order assumptions. Despite the convexity of the IC capacity region, fixing
an SIC order induces non-convexity in resource allocation, traditionally
requiring heuristic approximations. We instead introduce a dual-variable-guided
sorting criterion to identify globally optimal SIC orders, followed by convex
optimization with auxiliary log-det constraints, efficiently solved via binary
search. We also demonstrate that minPIC could potentially meet the stringent
high-rate, low-power targets of immersive XR and other 6G applications. To the
best of our knowledge, minPIC is the first algorithmic realisation of the
Pareto boundary of the SIC-achievable rate region for Gaussian ICs, opening the
door to scalable interference management in cell-free networks.

### [4] [Protecting Legacy Wireless Systems Against Interference: Precoding and Codebook Approaches Using Massive MIMO and Region Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02819)
*Sameer Mathad,Taejoon Kim,David J. Love*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于通信理论的方案，通过在大规模MIMO系统中加入区域约束来保护继承用户免受干扰，而不是使用地理排除区方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着高速无线通信需求的增长，需要利用与继承无线系统相邻的频段。但这会对重要基础设施网络中的继承用户造成干扰，需要开发保护继承用户的方案。

Method: 提出在大规模MIMO系统设计中加入区域约束（接收功率约束），并进行单用户和多用户系统的容量分析和预编码设计。

Result: 设计了一种预编码方法，允许在使用新频段的同时保护继承用户。

Conclusion: 通过通信理论基础的方法可以有效减少对继承用户的干扰影响，而不需要地理排除区，为新频段的利用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The ever-increasing demand for high-speed wireless communication has
generated significant interest in utilizing frequency bands that are adjacent
to those occupied by legacy wireless systems. Since the legacy wireless systems
were designed based on often decades-old assumptions about wireless
interference, utilizing these new bands will result in interference with the
existing legacy users. Many of these legacy wireless devices are used by
critical infrastructure networks upon which society depends. There is an urgent
need to develop schemes that can protect legacy users from such interference.
For many applications, legacy users are located within
geographically-constrained regions. Several studies have proposed mitigating
interference through the implementation of exclusion zones near these
geographically-constrained regions. In contrast to solutions based on
geographic exclusion zones, this paper presents a communication theory-based
solution. By leveraging knowledge of these geographically-constrained regions,
we aim to reduce the interference impact on legacy users. We achieve this by
incorporating received power constraints, termed as region constraints, in our
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system design. We perform a
capacity analysis of single-user massive MIMO and a sum-rate analysis of the
multi-user massive MIMO system with transmit power and region constraints. We
present a precoding design method that allows for the utilization of new
frequency bands while protecting legacy users.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了在概率视距阻塞下采用可重构夹持天线的功率分割SWIPT系统，通过联合优化天线位置和功率分割比来最大化平均信噪比，同时满足能量收集要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态环境中概率性视距阻塞对SWIPT系统性能的影响，通过机械可重构性来增强系统的可持续性和能量可行性。

Method: 采用功率分割技术，联合优化可重构夹持天线的位置和功率分割比例，推导出闭式最优解，实现平均信噪比最大化。

Result: 结果表明能量收集要求对最优天线位置和可行域具有决定性影响，需要将天线尽可能靠近用户以最大化平均信道增益。

Conclusion: 空间自适应与动态功率分割相结合，能够在概率视距阻塞下实现稳健的SWIPT性能，机械可重构性主要通过确保动态环境中的能量可行性来增强可持续性。

Abstract: This paper considers a power-splitting (PS)-based simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT) system employing a reconfigurable
pinching antenna (PA) under probabilistic line-of-sight (LoS) blockage. We
formulate a joint optimization of the PA position and the PS ratio to maximize
the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at a user, subject to its average
energy harvesting (EH) and PA placement limits. We derive a closed-form optimal
solution. Results demonstrate that the EH requirement has a deterministic
impact on the optimal PA position as well as its feasible region, requiring
deployment of the PA as close to the user as possible to maximize average
channel gain. This spatial adaptation, combined with dynamic PS, enables robust
SWIPT performance in the presence of probabilistic LoS blockage, revealing that
mechanical reconfigurability primarily enhances sustainability by ensuring
energy feasibility in dynamic environments.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: S2M2ECG是一个基于状态空间模型(SSM)的新型心电图分析架构，通过三级融合机制实现多导联ECG信号的高效处理，在性能、计算复杂度和ECG特征融合之间取得了良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多导联心电图(CVD诊断的重要方法)存在多传感器信息融合挑战，现有深度学习算法难以在性能、计算复杂度和多源ECG特征融合之间保持平衡。状态空间模型(特别是Mamba)在高效计算和线性复杂度方面的优势使其特别适合ECG这类低维数据。

Conclusion: S2M2ECG在性能、计算复杂度和ECG特异性特征之间取得了极佳平衡，为CVD诊断中的高性能轻量级计算开辟了新途径。

Abstract: As one of the most effective methods for cardiovascular disease (CVD)
diagnosis, multi-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals present a characteristic
multi-sensor information fusion challenge that has been continuously researched
in deep learning domains. Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with
different DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance,
computational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains
challenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent
design for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them
particularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes
S2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1)
Spatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level
signal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional
scanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward
directions, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information
fusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in
ECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated,
enabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration
with others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior
performance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios. Moreover,
its lightweight architecture ensures it has nearly the fewest parameters among
existing models, making it highly suitable for efficient inference and
convenient deployment. Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative
that strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity,
and ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance,
lightweight computations in CVD diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该CWT-YOLO流水线为旋转机械状态监控提供了一种高精度、高通用性且可视化故障位置的实用解决方案。

Abstract: This letter proposes a YOLO-based framework for spatial bearing fault
diagnosis using time-frequency spectrograms derived from continuous wavelet
transform (CWT). One-dimensional vibration signals are first transformed into
time-frequency spectrograms using Morlet wavelets to capture transient fault
signatures. These spectrograms are then processed by YOLOv9, v10, and v11
models to classify fault types. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets,
including Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Paderborn University (PU),
and Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS), the proposed CWT--YOLO pipeline
achieves significantly higher accuracy and generalizability than the baseline
MCNN--LSTM model. Notably, YOLOv11 reaches mAP scores of 99.4% (CWRU), 97.8%
(PU), and 99.5% (IMS). In addition, its region-aware detection mechanism
enables direct visualization of fault locations in spectrograms, offering a
practical solution for condition monitoring in rotating machinery.

*Ogechukwu Kanu,Ashkan Eshaghbeigi,Hatem Abou-Zeid*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于动量对比的自监督学习方案，用于无线电信号表示学习，通过在两个无线通信任务（AoA估计和AMC分类）上验证其有效性，展示了自监督学习在减少标注数据依赖和提升模型泛化能力方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 这是首个在多个任务上证明自监督学习对无线电信号有效性的工作，展示了自监督学习在改变无线通信AI方面的潜力，为可扩展的基础6G AI模型和解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to play a pivotal role in 6G.
However, a key challenge in developing AI-powered solutions is the extensive
data collection and labeling efforts required to train supervised deep learning
models. To overcome this, self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have
recently demonstrated remarkable success across various domains by leveraging
large volumes of unlabeled data to achieve near-supervised performance. In this
paper, we propose an effective SSL scheme for radio signal representation
learning using momentum contrast. By applying contrastive learning, our method
extracts robust, transferable representations from a large real-world dataset.
We assess the generalizability of these learned representations across two
wireless communications tasks: angle of arrival (AoA) estimation and automatic
modulation classification (AMC). Our results show that carefully designed
augmentations and diverse data enable contrastive learning to produce
high-quality, invariant latent representations. These representations are
effective even with frozen encoder weights, and fine-tuning further enhances
performance, surpassing supervised baselines. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to propose and demonstrate the effectiveness of
self-supervised learning for radio signals across multiple tasks. Our findings
highlight the potential of self-supervised learning to transform AI for
wireless communications by reducing dependence on labeled data and improving
model generalization - paving the way for scalable foundational 6G AI models
and solutions.

### [9] [Handwriting Imagery EEG Classification based on Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03111)
*Hao Yang,Guang Ouyang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用深度神经网络解码与非侵入式脑电图（EEG）相关的手写想象活动，将其转换为英文字母的极限，首次尝试解码与非侵入式EEG相关的手写想象，为脑机接口文本输出提供了概念验证和基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写想象已成为脑机接口（BCI）的有前景范式，旨在将大脑活动转换为文本输出。相比侵入式EEG记录，非侵入式记录为捕获BCI脑信号提供了更实用可行的方法。

Method: 5名参与者被指示想象书写26个英文字母，同时记录头皮EEG。首先进行EEG相似性测量以研究字母特异性模式，然后训练四个卷积神经网络（CNN）模型进行EEG分类。

Result: EEG数据明显表现出字母特异性模式，作为EEG到文本转换的概念验证。在3.85%的随机水平下，每个参与者的CNN分类器最高达到约20%的准确率。

Conclusion: 虽然达到的准确率不足以用于实用的脑到文本BCI，但模型性能在揭示将非侵入式记录的脑信号转换为文本输出的潜力方面值得注意，并为未来研究建立了基准。

Abstract: Handwriting imagery has emerged as a promising paradigm for brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) aimed at translating brain activity into text output.
Compared with invasively recorded electroencephalography (EEG), non-invasive
recording offers a more practical and feasible approach to capturing brain
signals for BCI. This study explores the limit of decoding non-invasive EEG
associated with handwriting imagery into English letters using deep neural
networks. To this end, five participants were instructed to imagine writing the
26 English letters with their EEG being recorded from the scalp. A measurement
of EEG similarity across letters was conducted to investigate letter-specific
patterns in the dataset. Subsequently, four convolutional neural network (CNN)
models were trained for EEG classification. Descriptively, the EEG data clearly
exhibited letter-specific patterns serving as a proof-of-concept for
EEG-to-text translation. Under the chance level of accuracy at 3.85%, the CNN
classifiers trained on each participant reached the highest limit of around
20%. This study marks the first attempt to decode non-invasive EEG associated
with handwriting imagery. Although the achieved accuracy is not sufficient for
a usable brain-to-text BCI, the model's performance is noteworthy in revealing
the potential for translating non-invasively recorded brain signals into text
outputs and establishing a baseline for future research.

### [10] [Deep Learning for High Speed Optical Coherence Elastography with a Fiber Scanning Endoscope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03193)
*Maximilian Neidhardt,Sarah Latus,Tim Eixmann,Gereon Hüttmann,Alexander Schlaefer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于深度学习的小型化光纤扫描内镜系统，用于快速实时弹性成像，在幻影和猪组织中显示出更高的测量精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弹性成像技术在微估中不适用，需要一种适合介入性手术的小型化、快速实时弹性测量方案。

Method: 设计光纤扫描内镜使用锐形扫描模式（5.05kHz），通过深度学习网络处理复杂波场图像序列，在幻影上进行端到端训练实现实时弹性估计。

Result: 与传统相位跟踪法相比，2D扫描锐形方法MAE从11.33kPa降至6.31kPa，3D方法从19.75kPa降至4.48kPa，在猪组织中也证明了可行性。

Conclusion: 该小型化光纤内镜系统结合深度学习处理，能够在微估手术中实现高精度实时弹性成像，为软组织病理诊断提供新方案。

Abstract: Tissue stiffness is related to soft tissue pathologies and can be assessed
through palpation or via clinical imaging systems, e.g., ultrasound or magnetic
resonance imaging. Typically, the image based approaches are not suitable
during interventions, particularly for minimally invasive surgery. To this end,
we present a miniaturized fiber scanning endoscope for fast and localized
elastography. Moreover, we propose a deep learning based signal processing
pipeline to account for the intricate data and the need for real-time
estimates. Our elasticity estimation approach is based on imaging complex and
diffuse wave fields that encompass multiple wave frequencies and propagate in
various directions. We optimize the probe design to enable different scan
patterns. To maximize temporal sampling while maintaining three-dimensional
information we define a scan pattern in a conical shape with a temporal
frequency of 5.05 kHz. To efficiently process the image sequences of complex
wave fields we consider a spatio-temporal deep learning network. We train the
network in an end-to-end fashion on measurements from phantoms representing
multiple elasticities. The network is used to obtain localized and robust
elasticity estimates, allowing to create elasticity maps in real-time. For 2D
scanning, our approach results in a mean absolute error of 6.31+-5.76 kPa
compared to 11.33+-12.78 kPa for conventional phase tracking. For scanning
without estimating the wave direction, the novel 3D method reduces the error to
4.48+-3.63 kPa compared to 19.75+-21.82 kPa for the conventional 2D method.
Finally, we demonstrate feasibility of elasticity estimates in ex-vivo porcine
tissue.

Conclusion: 该研究成功地将DRL技术应用于解决可移动天线系统中的聚焦优化问题，为应对天线交调挖提供了有效的解决方案，显著提升了ISAC系统的性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates a movable antenna (MA) enabled integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) system under the influence of antenna crosstalk. First, it
generalizes the antenna crosstalk model from the conventional fixed-position
antenna (FPA) system to the MA scenario. Then, a Cramer-Rao bound (CRB)
minimization problem driven by joint beamforming and antenna position design is
presented. Specifically, to address this highly non-convex flexible beamforming
problem, we deploy a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to train a
flexible beamforming agent. To ensure stability during training, a Twin Delayed
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm is adopted to balance
exploration with reward maximization for efficient and reliable learning.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed crosstalk-resilient (CR)
algorithm enhances the overall ISAC performance compared to other benchmark
schemes.

### [12] [Credible Uncertainty Quantification under Noise and System Model Mismatch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03311)
*Penggao Yan,Li-Ta Hsu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种统一的多指标评估框架，用于评估状态估计器的可信度，通过结合传统指标和适当评分规则，能够高精度识别模型缺陷类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态估计器自我评估的不确定性指标（如协方差矩阵）可能因模型偏差而导致误导，影响下游任务的可靠性。

Method: 构建了一个紧凑的可信度评估组合，结合传统指标（NEES、NCI）和适当评分规则（NLL、ES），提出了基于能量距离的位置测试和利用NLL与ES不对称敏感性的方法。

Result: 在六种不同可信度场景的蒙特卡洛模拟中，该方法实现了80-100%的高分类准确率，显著超过单一指标基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为将可信度指标模式转化为可操作的模型缺陷诊断提供了实用工具。

Abstract: State estimators often provide self-assessed uncertainty metrics, such as
covariance matrices, whose reliability is critical for downstream tasks.
However, these self-assessments can be misleading due to underlying modeling
violations like noise or system model mismatch. This letter addresses the
problem of estimator credibility by introducing a unified, multi-metric
evaluation framework. We construct a compact credibility portfolio that
synergistically combines traditional metrics like the Normalized Estimation
Error Squared (NEES) and the Noncredibility Index (NCI) with proper scoring
rules, namely the Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and the Energy Score (ES). Our
key contributions are a novel energy distance-based location test to robustly
detect system model misspecification and a method that leverages the asymmetric
sensitivities of NLL and ES to distinguish optimism covariance scaling from
system bias. Monte Carlo simulations across six distinct credibility scenarios
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high classification accuracy
(80-100%), drastically outperforming single-metric baselines which consistently
fail to provide a complete and correct diagnosis. This framework provides a
practical tool for turning patterns of credibility indicators into actionable
diagnoses of model deficiencies.

Conclusion: 通过理论分析截止率并优化星座设计，能够有效应对混合噪声环境，提升通信系统性能，所提出的界限和方法具有实用价值。

Abstract: Mixed noise, composed of white Gaussian noise (WGN) and impulsive noise (IN),
appears in numerous communication scenarios and can severely degrade system
performance. In this paper, we address this issue by optimizing the transmitted
constellation under mixed noise based on a theoretical analysis of the cutoff
rate (CR). First, starting from the passband model of the mixed noise, we
derive its corresponding baseband representation. Due to the complexity of the
CR, an exact analytic expression is generally intractable. Therefore, the
baseband noise model is employed to obtain closed-form lower and upper bounds
of the CR. A piecewise linear approximation is applied to derive efficient
bounds by exploiting the algebraic properties of the integral terms. These
bounds are then used as criteria to optimize the transmitted constellation
points in both geometric and probabilistic distributions. The projected
gradient method is employed to solve the optimization problem, and the
convergence and properties of the solutions are analyzed. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed CR bounds are tight and exhibit the expected
asymptotic behavior. Furthermore, the optimized constellation scheme achieves a
significant rate improvement compared to baselines.

Result: 在仿真中实现了接近Cramér-Rao下界的近最优精度，优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 该方法为混合模拟数字架构提供了有效的DoA估计解决方案，在保持成本效益的同时实现了高性能

Abstract: Hybrid Analog and Digital (HAD) architectures provide a cost-effective
alternative for large-scale antenna arrays, but accurate Direction-of-Arrival
(DoA) estimation remains challenging due to limited digital dimensionality and
constrained beamforming design. In this work, we propose a HAD architecture
that employs Butler matrices to synthesize DFT beams over a uniform linear
array. By exploiting the Cauchy-like displacement structure of the beamformed
signal, we introduce a second-order statistics estimation algorithm that
achieves near-optimal accuracy, approaching the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB)
and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in simulation.

TL;DR: 通过地震信号检测大象脚步的分析框架，提出了上下文自定义窗口技术，在资源约束环境下实现了高准确度的实时分类


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人象冲突中的大象检测问题，克服依赖人工分类的限制，开发适合实时分类的资源约束解决方案

Method: 提出上下文自定义窗口(CCW)事件检测技术，与STA/LTA方法进行对比，采用SVM支持向量机进行分类，使用解释性AI进行特征影响分析

Result: 最大检测距离可达155.6米(受控)和140米(自然)，SVM分类准确玉受控环境99%、自然生境73%、人象冲突区70%，零交叉点数和DTW对齐成本是最重要特征

Conclusion: 该框架能在资源约束环境下实现高效大象脚步检测，CCW技术和SVM分类器表现优异，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic
aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the
promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of
elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time
classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our
previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting
resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and
computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection
technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically
for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were
conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average
(STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection
range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments.
Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across
multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73%
in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most
challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI
identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while
Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.

### [16] [The Lifecycle Principle: Stabilizing Dynamic Neural Networks with State Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02575)
*Zichuan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了生命周期(LC)原则，通过状态记忆机制解决长期神经元停活导致的训练不稳定问题，提高了模型的沿半性和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法如Dropout只是瞬时停用神经元，本文探索更强的正则化方式：长期停活神经元。但这种方法导致严重的训练不稳定问题，特别是当神经元复活时使用随机权重会破坏已学习的知识。

Method: 提出生命周期(LC)原则，核心是状态记忆机制。当神经元复活时，不是重新初始化，而是恢复到其上一次有效状态的参数。这种方法保留了已学习知识，避免了破坏性的优化冲击。

Result: 理论分析显示L原则能够平滑损失几何地形，导向更平坦的最小值，这与更好的沿半性相关。图像分类实验证明该方法提高了沿半性和稳健性。分离实验确认状态记忆是获得这些收益的关键因素。

Conclusion: 生命周期原则通过状态记忆机制，有效解决了长期神经元停活导致的训练不稳定问题，在保留已学习知识的同时提高了模型的沿半性和稳健性能力。

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for
extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like
Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge:
severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To
solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism
centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a
revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective
state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive
optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle
smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima
associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness.
Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for
achieving these gains.

Conclusion: 该方法在存在共同噪声的情况下表现出强大的鲁棒性和适应性，为均值场游戏中的纳什均衡学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale
multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a
challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or
when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an
efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve
population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical
sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting
policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common
noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we
demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of
Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the
presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our
approach.

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical
challenge, particularly in vast and partially observable environments where
real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the
context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) coordination in wildlife protection. By modeling hidden
environmental factors and inter-agent dynamics through latent variables, our
method enhances exploration and coordination under uncertainty.We implement and
evaluate our EM-MARL framework using a custom simulation involving 10 UAVs
tasked with patrolling protected habitats of the endangered Iranian leopard.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection
accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence when compared to standard
algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG). Our findings underscore the potential of combining EM
inference with MARL to improve decentralized decisionmaking in complex,
high-stakes conservation scenarios. The full implementation, simulation
environment, and training scripts are publicly available on GitHub.

*Hunter Gittlin*

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种组别敏感的阈值检测方法，通过为不同人口组设置不同的决策阈值，在类别不平衡问题中较合成数据生成方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统类别不平衡处理方法的局限性，特别是合成数据生成方法常带来新的问题。需要找到更简单、更可解释且更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用组别敏感的阈值检测方法，为不同人口组设置不同的决策阈值。这种方法优化了平衡准确率和最差组平衡准确率之间的底特雷效率前沿。

Result: 组别特定阈值方法比SMOTE和CT-GAN增强模型获得1.5-4%更高的平衡准确率，同时改善了最差组平衡准确率。在7种模型家族中都获得了一致的结果。

Conclusion: 组别敏感的阈值检测提供了一种更简单、更可解释且更有效的类别不平衡解决方案。与合成数据生成方法结合使用并没有显著改善，说明这两种方法存在重复性。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, with
traditional solutions often creating as many problems as they solve. We
demonstrate that group-aware threshold calibration--setting different decision
thresholds for different demographic groups--provides superior robustness
compared to synthetic data generation methods. Through extensive experiments,
we show that group-specific thresholds achieve 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy
than SMOTE and CT-GAN augmented models while improving worst-group balanced
accuracy. Unlike single-threshold approaches that apply one cutoff across all
groups, our group-aware method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced
accuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy, enabling fine-grained control over
group-level performance. Critically, we find that applying group thresholds to
synthetically augmented data yields minimal additional benefit, suggesting
these approaches are fundamentally redundant. Our results span seven model
families including linear, tree-based, instance-based, and boosting methods,
confirming that group-aware threshold calibration offers a simpler, more
interpretable, and more effective solution to class imbalance.

TL;DR: 提出了DPO-PRO算法，一种基于直接偏好优化的鲁棒微调方法，用于在公共卫生领域的序列资源分配问题中设计奖励函数，能够有效处理偏好信号中的噪声并降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共卫生领域的序列资源分配问题具有复杂模糊的目标和有限的数据可用性，这为对齐技术提供了具有挑战性的测试环境。需要开发能够处理偏好分布不确定性的鲁棒算法。

Method: 基于直接偏好优化(DPO)，提出了DPO-PRO算法，采用轻量级的分布鲁棒优化(DRO)公式来考虑偏好分布的不确定性，相比之前的DRO-based DPO方法更加不保守。

Result: 在ARMMAN运营的真实世界母婴移动健康项目以及标准对齐基准测试中，DPO-PRO相比现有DPO变体在噪声偏好信号下的鲁棒性持续提升，同时与基于自反思的基线方法性能相当但推理成本显著降低。

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种有效的鲁棒微调算法，能够在复杂公共卫生场景中处理偏好不确定性，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for
sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human
preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging
testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data
availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust
Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is
significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal
mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well
as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to
existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to
prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while
requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)在深度神经网络中通过最小化损失和锐度来改善泛化性能，但在分布式大批次训练中存在效率低下的问题

Method: LSAM将SAM的对抗步骤与异步分布式采样策略相结合，生成异步分布式采样方案，产生平滑的锐度感知损失景观进行优化

Result: 该设计消除了同步瓶颈，加速了大批次收敛，与数据并行SAM相比提供了更高的最终准确率

Conclusion: LSAM在保持SAM泛化优势的同时，显著提高了分布式大批次训练的效率

Abstract: While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in deep
neural networks by minimizing both loss and sharpness, it suffers from
inefficiency in distributed large-batch training. We present Landscape-Smoothed
SAM (LSAM), a novel optimizer that preserves SAM's generalization advantages
while offering superior efficiency. LSAM integrates SAM's adversarial steps
with an asynchronous distributed sampling strategy, generating an asynchronous
distributed sampling scheme, producing a smoothed sharpness-aware loss
landscape for optimization. This design eliminates synchronization bottlenecks,
accelerates large-batch convergence, and delivers higher final accuracy
compared to data-parallel SAM.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently utilize
deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a shared backbone of feature
representations used to compute likelihoods in an action selection layer.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the convergence and global optima of
policy networks, but few have analyzed representational structures of those
underlying networks. While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that
under certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which
we refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the
state-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal
actions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)
the variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to
zero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations
collapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed
those aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since
the collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise
angles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:
can we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target
configuration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that
learning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads
to the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,
which accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG
induces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action
selection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI
Gym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any
discrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and
robustly.

TL;DR: 该论文将似然函数校准从二元分类扩展到多分类问题，利用Aitchison几何和等距对数比变换，提出了多假设情况下的校准定义、幂等性和分布约束，并应用于机器学习中的非线性判别分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统校准研究主要关注概率预测，而似然函数校准（特别是在生物识别中）仅限于二元分类情况。本文旨在将似然函数校准的概念和方法扩展到多假设场景。

Method: 使用Aitchison几何和单纯形空间理论，通过等距对数比变换将对数似然比扩展到多分类情况，恢复了贝叶斯规则的向量形式，并定义了多假设下的校准概念和幂等性。

Result: 成功将二元分类的似然函数校准理论扩展到多分类场景，提出了基于等距对数比变换的多假设校准框架，并在非线性判别分析中实现了校准的似然函数。

Conclusion: 本文为多假设情况下的似然函数校准提供了理论框架，提高了机器学习方法的可解释性和可靠性，特别是在需要校准证据权重的应用中。

Abstract: While calibration of probabilistic predictions has been widely studied, this
paper rather addresses calibration of likelihood functions. This has been
discussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and
mutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be
written as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs
and its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the
idempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the
LLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been
limited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two
hypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to
recover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending
therefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.
Especially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the
constraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple
hypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio
transformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still
provide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear
discriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated
likelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability
and the reliability of the method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号具有噪声大、高维、非线性的特点，传统机器学习方法难以捕捉其复杂的时空动态特性，需要更强大的序列建模方法来提升神经疾病诊断效果。

Method: 采用Mamba选择性状态空间模型，在大规模癫痫和非癫痫EEG数据集上，先进行自监督重建任务预训练，然后进行癫痫检测任务微调。

Result: 在独立测试集上达到0.72的AUROC性能，证明了该模型在EEG癫痫检测任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发大规模、临床可应用的EEG基础模型迈出了重要一步，展示了基础模型在神经疾病诊断中的潜力。

Abstract: This work explores the potential of foundation models, specifically a
Mamba-based selective state space model, for enhancing EEG analysis in
neurological disorder diagnosis. EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like
epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional,
and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances
in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex
spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in
sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and
expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a
Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG
recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure
detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of
0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward
developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: t-SNE和UMAP等降维方法在可视化聚类数据时虽然能很好分离簇群，但往往会扭曲数据的全局几何结构

Method: 采用三步法：先对数据进行聚类，然后分别嵌入每个簇，最后对齐所有簇以获得全局嵌入

Result: 在多个合成和真实数据集上验证，该方法与现有方法竞争力相当，但更加透明

Conclusion: 这种模块化方法提供了比传统降维方法更好的透明度和全局结构保持能力

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular methods
for visualizing data with a potential (latent) clustered structure. They are
known to group data points at the same time as they embed them, resulting in
visualizations with well-separated clusters that preserve local information
well. However, t-SNE and UMAP also tend to distort the global geometry of the
underlying data. We propose a more transparent, modular approach consisting of
first clustering the data, then embedding each cluster, and finally aligning
the clusters to obtain a global embedding. We demonstrate this approach on
several synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it is competitive with
existing methods, while being much more transparent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型的专家剪枝方法主要减少内存使用但无法显著提升GPU推理性能，且固定激活专家数量导致冗余计算和次优性能。

Method: LExI利用模型权重估计每层相对重要性，无需训练数据即可自适应确定每层最优激活专家数量。

Result: 在语言和视觉MoE基准测试中，LExI显著优于传统剪枝方法，Qwen1.5-MoE在H100 GPU上实现相同吞吐量且精度提升10%。

Conclusion: LExI提供了一种有效的MoE模型推理优化方案，通过层间专家数量自适应分配实现计算效率的显著提升。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale efficiently by activating only a subset
of experts per token, offering a computationally sparse alternative to dense
architectures. While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and
intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in
inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures
typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers,
resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we
first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint
but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized
frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free
optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per
layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to
estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the
number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art
language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly
outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency
with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves
the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than
traditional expert pruning.

TL;DR: Transparent Earth是一个基于Transformer的架构，用于从稀疏度、分辨率和模态各异的异构数据集中重建地下属性，支持任意模态数量的扩展和上下文学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决从不同类型观测数据（如应力角度、地幔温度、构造板块类型等）重建地下属性的挑战，这些数据在稀疏性、分辨率和模态上存在差异，需要一个能够灵活处理多模态数据并支持新模态扩展的模型。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的架构，结合位置编码和模态编码（通过文本嵌入模型从每个模态的描述中衍生），支持任意数量的模态，目前包含八种模态（方向角度、分类类别、连续属性如温度和厚度），支持上下文学习，可无输入或任意数量观测进行预测。

Result: 在验证数据上，预测应力角度的误差减少了三倍以上，模型具有可扩展性，参数增加时性能提升。

Conclusion: Transparent Earth是地球地下属性的初步基础模型，旨在预测地球上任何地方的地下属性，具有可扩展性和高性能。

Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for
reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in
sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct
type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate
type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together
with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a
description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an
arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not
considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities
spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties
such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context
learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or
with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of
modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle
by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and
demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these
advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's
subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on
Earth.

Method: 使用Bregman散度诱导的质心聚合连接多假设预测和集成学习，支持闭式最小二乘估计和基于梯度的通用目标优化，提供可调多样性机制控制偏差-方差-多样性权衡

Conclusion: 该框架为回归和分类任务提供了与损失几何一致的预测不确定性统一处理方法，能够有效控制偏差-方差-多样性权衡

Abstract: Existing approaches to predictive uncertainty rely either on multi-hypothesis
prediction, which promotes diversity but lacks principled aggregation, or on
ensemble learning, which improves accuracy but rarely captures the structured
ambiguity. This implicitly means that a unified framework consistent with the
loss geometry remains absent. The Structured Basis Function Network addresses
this gap by linking multi-hypothesis prediction and ensembling through
centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences. The formulation applies
across regression and classification by aligning predictions with the geometry
of the loss, and supports both a closed-form least-squares estimator and a
gradient-based procedure for general objectives. A tunable diversity mechanism
provides parametric control of the bias-variance-diversity trade-off,
connecting multi-hypothesis generalisation with loss-aware ensemble
aggregation. Experiments validate this relation and use the mechanism to study
the complexity-capacity-diversity trade-off across datasets of increasing
difficulty with deep-learning predictors.

Result: 实验表明，通过该框架预训练的模型在各种基于图结构的任务上优于基线模型

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种有效的图神经网络预训练方法，能够更好地学习全局图结构信息，具有广泛的适用性和灵活性

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by
inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure
due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the
low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global
information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the
network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph.
Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform
baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most
existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge
feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is
structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all
graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when
task-specific data is sparse.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现视觉语言模型(VLMs)中存在可线性解码的冲突信号，冲突检测和解决机制在模型不同层中功能分离，这为改善模型鲁棒性提供了可解释性基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中冲突检测与冲突解决机制分解的挑战，以提升模型在复杂多模态场景下的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 对LLaVA-OV-7B模型进行机制性研究，使用线性探针监督度量和基于组的注意力模式分析来分解冲突检测与解决过程。

Result: 发现模型中间层出现可线性解码的冲突信号，冲突检测和解决的注意力模式在网络不同阶段出现分化，证实了二者是功能不同的机制。

Conclusion: 冲突检测与解决的分解为实现更可操作的可解释性和针对性干预提供了基础，有助于提升模型在挑战性多模态环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper highlights the challenge of decomposing conflict detection from
conflict resolution in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and presents potential
approaches, including using a supervised metric via linear probes and
group-based attention pattern analysis. We conduct a mechanistic investigation
of LLaVA-OV-7B, a state-of-the-art VLM that exhibits diverse resolution
behaviors when faced with conflicting multimodal inputs. Our results show that
a linearly decodable conflict signal emerges in the model's intermediate layers
and that attention patterns associated with conflict detection and resolution
diverge at different stages of the network. These findings support the
hypothesis that detection and resolution are functionally distinct mechanisms.
We discuss how such decomposition enables more actionable interpretability and
targeted interventions for improving model robustness in challenging multimodal
settings.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘方法在严格评估下效果不佳，需要更有效的方法来安全删除私有数据或有害知识，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 使用Jensen-Shannon散度作为训练目标，针对遗忘集和保留集进行优化，实现更稳定有效的遗忘动态。还提出了LKF数据集和基于LLM的语义评估方法。

Result: JensUn在实验中表现出更好的遗忘-效用权衡，对良性重新学习具有强韧性。新的评估框架显示许多现有方法效果不如预期。

Conclusion: JensUn提供了一种更有效的大语言模型遗忘方法，配合改进的评估框架，能够更准确地评估遗忘方法的有效性。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) involves precisely removing
specific information from a pre-trained model. This is crucial to ensure safety
of LLMs by deleting private data or harmful knowledge acquired during
pre-training. However, existing unlearning methods often fall short when
subjected to thorough evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce JensUn, where
we leverage the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the training objective for both
forget and retain sets for more stable and effective unlearning dynamics
compared to commonly used loss functions. In extensive experiments, JensUn
achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods, and even
demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Additionally, for a
precise unlearning evaluation, we introduce LKF, a curated dataset of
lesser-known facts that provides a realistic unlearning scenario. Finally, to
comprehensively test unlearning methods, we propose (i) employing an LLM as
semantic judge instead of the standard ROUGE score, and (ii) using worst-case
unlearning evaluation over various paraphrases and input formats. Our improved
evaluation framework reveals that many existing methods are less effective than
previously thought.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肥胖是一个重要的全球健康问题，与多种慢性疾病相关。机器学习在早期肥胖风险预测中展现出潜力，但对于集成技术（特别是混合多数投票咈集成堆叠）的比较评估仍有限。

Method: 使用两个数据集评估三种集成模型：多数硬投票、加权硬投票咈堆叠（以多层感知机为元分类器）。分析了9种机器学习算法的50个超参数配置，选择前三个模型作为基学习器。预处理步骤包括数据集平衡咈异常值检测，使用准确率咈F1分数评估模型性能。

Conclusion: 结果证明集成堆叠方法提供了更强大的预测能力，尤其适用于复杂的数据分布，而混合多数投票仍然是一个健壮的备选方案。

Abstract: Obesity is a critical global health issue driven by dietary, physiological,
and environmental factors, and is strongly associated with chronic diseases
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Machine learning has
emerged as a promising approach for early obesity risk prediction, yet a
comparative evaluation of ensemble techniques -- particularly hybrid majority
voting and ensemble stacking -- remains limited. This study aims to compare
hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk
prediction, identifying which approach delivers higher accuracy and efficiency.
The analysis seeks to highlight the complementary strengths of these ensemble
techniques in guiding better predictive model selection for healthcare
applications. Two datasets were utilized to evaluate three ensemble models:
Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer
Perceptron as meta-classifier). A pool of nine Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, evaluated across a total of 50 hyperparameter configurations, was
analyzed to identify the top three models to serve as base learners for the
ensemble methods. Preprocessing steps involved dataset balancing, and outlier
detection, and model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and F1-Score. On
Dataset-1, weighted hard voting and stacking achieved nearly identical
performance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard
voting. On Dataset-2, stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy:
0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to majority hard voting (Accuracy: 0.981707,
F1: 0.981675) and weighted hard voting, which showed the lowest performance.
The findings confirm that ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive
capability, particularly for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority
voting remains a robust alternative.

Conclusion: CPTC算法为带突变点的时间序列提供了有效的保形预测框架，在理论和实践上都证明了其优越性

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to
provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods
struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the
underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal
Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this
gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online
conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We
prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under
minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6
synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 传统神经网络和傅里叶神经网络在处理非周期信号叠加时存在局限，特别是在预测具有不可通约频率的准周期函数时，ARIMA等传统模型往往优于神经网络和大语言模型。

Method: 提出Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN混合模型，利用通用近视映射定理，使用Kolmogorov-Arnold网络处理静态非线性部分，并通过预训练的自回归组件引入记忆机制，保留有用信息并消除冗余。

Result: 实验数据显示，AR-KAN在72%的真实世界数据集上提供了更优越的结果。

Conclusion: AR-KAN模型成功结合了神经网络和自回归方法的优势，有效解决了准周期函数预测问题，在大多数实际应用中表现出更好的性能。

Abstract: Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis
of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and
similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of
neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the
superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic
signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of
signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most
neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we
propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the
benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply
a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include
memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the
most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data
indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world
datasets.

Motivation: 现有的PDE基础模型存在自回归滚动性能差、外部分布性能下降、计算资源和训练数据要求高等问题，限制了其在关键应用中的使用。

Method: 受大语言模型中"思考"策略的启发，提出了两种奖励模型来评估随机基础模型的预测结果，通过测试时计算来提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: TTC框架为PDE建模的更高级思维算法奠定了基础，包括基于强化学习的方法，有望转变物理和工程领域的计算工作流。

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern
computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally
expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating
such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by
the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,
especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have
significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in
many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking"
strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first
test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational
resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer
training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of
reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for
spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible
Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures
improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive
inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced
reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building
reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational
workflows in physics and engineering.

Conclusion: 该分布式强化学习框架为大规模电网管理提供了有效的实时控制解决方案，具有更好的适应性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the
expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in
controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human
and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving
context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control
strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning
framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture
consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual
power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural
Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information
within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and
enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and
potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized
approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global
observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level
agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment
constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment
show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the
standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed
model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the
simulation-based Expert method.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in machine learning (ML),
particularly in the medical domain, where underrepresented minority classes
lead to biased models and reduced predictive performance. This study introduces
Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that
enhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum
principles such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike
conventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that
preserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and
classification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
datasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical
significance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against
traditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN,
SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as
Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE
significantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA),
kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more
informative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired
transformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class
imbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models
in medical diagnostics and decision-making. This study highlights the potential
of quantum-inspired resampling techniques in advancing state-of-the-art ML
methodologies.

Conclusion: SBICE框架通过建模参数不确定性并进行后验推断，为因果评估提供了更可靠的数据生成方法，解决了现有方法在参数不确定性处理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world
observational data is critical for evaluating causal estimators, but remains a
challenging task. Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing
synthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing
variation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of
confounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide
point estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed
estimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the
source data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over
parameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially
leading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based
inference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative
parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source
dataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies
parameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with
the source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves
the reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,
which supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking
under uncertainty.

Abstract: Offloading footwear helps prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) by
lowering plantar pressure (PP), yet prescription decisions remain fragmented:
feature selection varies, personalization is limited, and evaluation practices
differ. We performed a narrative review of 45 studies (12 guidelines/protocols,
25 knowledge-based systems, 8 machine-learning applications) published to Aug
2025. We thematically analyzed knowledge type, decision logic, evaluation
methods, and enabling technologies. Guidelines emphasize PP thresholds (<=200
kPa or >=25--30\% reduction) but rarely yield actionable, feature-level
outputs. Knowledge-based systems use rule- and sensor-driven logic, integrating
PP monitoring, adherence tracking, and usability testing. ML work introduces
predictive, optimization, and generative models with high computational
accuracy but limited explainability and clinical validation. Evaluation remains
fragmented: protocols prioritize biomechanical tests; knowledge-based systems
assess usability/adherence; ML studies focus on technical accuracy with weak
linkage to long-term outcomes. From this synthesis we propose a five-part CDSS
framework: (1) a minimum viable dataset; (2) a hybrid architecture combining
rules, optimization, and explainable ML; (3) structured feature-level outputs;
(4) continuous validation and evaluation; and (5) integration with clinical and
telehealth workflows. This framework aims to enable scalable, patient-centered
CDSSs for DFU care; prioritizing interoperable datasets, explainable models,
and outcome-focused evaluation will be key to clinical adoption.

Conclusion: PDRL提供了一种简单高效的后处理方案，能够在不影响已训练模型预测准确性的前提下实现不确定性量化

Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs).
However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative
techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been
proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods
cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework
for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network
potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc
descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy
between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to
act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL
and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their
effectiveness and limitations.

Motivation: 自监督强化学习中，技能多样性学习面临两个主要挑战：高维特征空间中难以找到有意义技能，以及缺乏统一的多样性评估标准。传统方法需要预先定义特定多样性概念，导致结果难以比较且多样性形式受限。

Method: 采用生态学中的Vendi Score指标作为多样性度量，允许用户指定任意形式的相似性函数来定义多样性。基于此提出了VendiRL统一框架，通过不同的相似性函数来激励不同形式的技能多样性。

Conclusion: Vendi Score指标和VendiRL框架为解决强化学习中技能多样性评估和学习提供了灵活统一的解决方案，能够适应不同环境和任务需求，推动自监督RL的发展。

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is
learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.
Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent
issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured
by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across
downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what
constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific
notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to
inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across
different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity
unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity
that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --
allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We
demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,
a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given
distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,
which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive
environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

Motivation: 现有拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习方法假设完全客户端参与，但在实际通信约束和客户端可用性下，部分参与是常态。当采样客户端包含拜占庭多数时，现有方法会立即失效。

Method: 引入延迟动量聚合原则：服务器聚合最近接收的非参与客户端梯度，并结合活跃客户端的实时动量。提出D-Byz-SGDM优化器实现这一原则。

Result: 建立了收敛保证，恢复了完全参与的结果，并匹配了部分参与设置的基本下界。深度学习实验验证了理论发现，在各种拜占庭攻击下表现出稳定鲁棒的训练性能。

Conclusion: D-Byz-SGDM方法有效解决了部分参与联邦学习中的拜占庭攻击问题，提供了理论保证和实际验证，为稀疏通信场景下的安全联邦学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine
clients that exhibit malicious behavior. While existing Byzantine-robust FL
methods provide strong convergence guarantees (e.g., to a stationary point in
expectation) under Byzantine attacks, they typically assume full client
participation, which is unrealistic due to communication constraints and client
availability. Under partial participation, existing methods fail immediately
after the sampled clients contain a Byzantine majority, creating a fundamental
challenge for sparse communication. First, we introduce delayed momentum
aggregation, a novel principle where the server aggregates the most recently
received gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from
active clients. Our optimizer D-Byz-SGDM (Delayed Byzantine-robust SGD with
Momentum) implements this delayed momentum aggregation principle for
Byzantine-robust FL with partial participation. Then, we establish convergence
guarantees that recover previous full participation results and match the
fundamental lower bounds we prove for the partial participation setting.
Experiments on deep learning tasks validated our theoretical findings, showing
stable and robust training under various Byzantine attacks.

*Minxin Zhang,Yuxuan Liu,Hayden Schaeffer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaGO结合了正交化动量更新和AdaGrad型自适应步长，在保持正交化更新方向的同时通过累积梯度范数自适应调整步长，在理论和实验上都优于Muon和Adam。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器通过正交化动量更新权重矩阵，在大语言模型训练中表现出色，但缺乏确定学习率的方法。而AdaGrad作为广泛使用的自适应方法，通过累积历史梯度来缩放随机梯度。研究旨在结合两种方法的优势。

Method: 提出AdaGO算法，将基于范数的AdaGrad型步长与正交化更新方向结合。保持更新方向的正交性（可解释为谱下降方向），同时通过累积梯度范数缩放方向来适应优化地形。实现只需在Muon基础上增加一个标量变量（累积平方梯度范数）。

Result: 在非凸函数的随机和确定性设置下建立了最优理论收敛率。在CIFAR-10分类和函数回归任务上的实证结果表明，AdaGO优于Muon和Adam。

Conclusion: AdaGO成功结合了正交化更新和自适应步长的优势，计算和内存效率高，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via
orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large
language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the
learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a
widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated
past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based
AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing
together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of
Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be
interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to
the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past
gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification
to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared
gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient.
Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions
in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and
unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10
classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon
and Adam.

*Hritik Arasu,Faisal R Jahangiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种流式、无源测试时自适应方法，结合熵最小化、批量归一化统计更新和安全机制，用于睡眠分期模型的在线适应，在未见过的生理或记录条件下保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠分期模型在面对未见过的患者生理特征或记录条件时性能会下降，需要一种实用的在线自适应方法，无需源数据或患者校准，适合设备端或床边使用。

Method: 结合熵最小化(Tent)与批量归一化统计刷新，采用两个安全机制：熵门控在不确定窗口暂停适应，EMA重置机制防止漂移。模型无关，无需源数据。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF Expanded数据集上，使用单导联EEG，相比冻结基线模型在秒级延迟和最小内存占用下获得一致性能提升，报告了各阶段指标和Cohen's k。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用的流式测试时自适应方案，能够在部署时适应新条件，保持模型性能，适合实时临床应用。

Abstract: Sleep staging models often degrade when deployed on patients with unseen
physiology or recording conditions. We propose a streaming, source-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) recipe that combines entropy minimization (Tent)
with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and two safety rails: an entropy gate to
pause adaptation on uncertain windows and an EMA-based reset to reel back
drift. On Sleep-EDF Expanded, using single-lead EEG (Fpz-Cz, 100 Hz, 30s
epochs; R&K to AASM mapping), we show consistent gains over a frozen baseline
at seconds-level latency and minimal memory, reporting per-stage metrics and
Cohen's k. The method is model-agnostic, requires no source data or patient
calibration, and is practical for on-device or bedside use.

TL;DR: 多模态数据融合方法通过结合X射线和吸收率数据，提高了激光粉末床融池动力学预测精度，并可以仅使用低成本的吸收率数据进行预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单一传感器在增材制造过程监控中的局限性：X射线成本高不实用，而低成本光电二极管数据噪声大、预测准确性低

Method: 采用多模态数据融合框架，结合CNN网络处理X射线空间特征和RNN网络处理吸收率时间序列特征，通过转移学习把多模态模型知识转移到仅使用吸收率数据的模型

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不使用费用高昂的X射线设备的情况下，仅使用低成本的吸收率数据实现高精度的融池动力学预测，为增材制造提供了成本效益高的实时监控方案

Abstract: While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive
manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For
example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about
subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial
settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate
with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when
used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for
predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with
low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.
Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,
using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a
transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool
dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the
multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly
improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.
Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using
only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This
multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has
broad applicability in additive manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物理知识融入符号回归(PiSR)方法需要专门的形式化和手工特征工程，限制了其适用性和普及性，需要一种更自动化的方法来融入领域知识

Method: 将LLM集成到SR的损失函数中，添加一个表示LLM对SR生成方程评估的项，使用三种SR算法(DEAP, gplearn, PySR)和三种预训练LLM(Falcon, Mistral, LLama 2)在三种物理动力学问题上进行验证

Result: LLM集成一致地提升了从数据重构物理动力学的能力，增强了SR模型对噪声和复杂性的稳健性，更信息丰富的提示语进一步提高了性能

Conclusion: 利用LLMs的上下文理解能力可以有效地自动化领域知识融入符号回归过程，减少手工干预，使物理知识融入符号回归更加普及和适用于更广泛的科学问题

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated
scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from
experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of
integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's
generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by
incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized
formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only
to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the
contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim
to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual
intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of
scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,
adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We
extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and
PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three
physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic
wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the
reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR
models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt
engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve
performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的二进制量化方法，通过动态选择最优子矩阵和适应性分组策略，在仅需1.007比特的平均长度下，保持了模型性能，超越了之前的二进制量化方法并与4毕特方法相竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型需要大量内存和计算资源，二进制量化能大幅降低存储和推理成本，但传统二进制量化导致性能显著下降，需要找到新的优化方法来缩小与4毕特量化方法的性能差距。

Method: 提出了一种专门为二进制量化设计的新题优化目标，以及三种实现该目标的算法。通过动态识别最优的非结构化子矩阵，采用适应性分组策略来改进块量化。

Result: 平均比特长度仅为1.007比特，量化后的LLaMA 3.2 3B模型达到迷8.23的困惑度（原始为7.81），显著超越之前最佳二进制量化方法BiLLM（123.90困惑度），与GPTQ等4毕特方法相竞争。量化过程高效，单CPU核只需14秒完成LLaMA 3.2 3B权重量化，整体过程小于100分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效的二进制量化解决方案，在极低的毕特长度下保持了模型质量，为大语言模型的实际部署提供了可行的压缩技术。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require
substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which
compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in
{-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However,
such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation
compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we
propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along
with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances
blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured
sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007
bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA
3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original
7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90.
Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ
in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly
efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights
on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes
and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

TL;DR: 扩展ReLU过渡图(RTG)框架，通过图论模型分析ReLU网络的线性激活区域和函数行为，揭示了随机初始化时的扩展性质、度分布和谱特性，并通过区域熵、谱间隔等提供新的容量和泛化界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提供统一的框架来通过离散函数几何视角分析ReLU网络，理解其泛化特性，为识别和改善网络性能提供新工具。

Method: 将ReLU网络模型化为ReLU过渡图(RTG)，其中节点代表线性激活区域，边连接仅差一个ReLU激活翻转的区域。理论分析随机初始化时的图结构特性，并通过小网络实验验证。

Result: 证明随机初始化时RTG具有强扩展性、二项式度分布和特定谱特性，这些特性突出地控制泛化。区域熵在过参数化时饱和，谱间隔与泛化相关，相邻区域间的KL散度反映函数平滑性。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了通过离散函数几何分析ReLU网络的统一框架，为理解、诊断和改善泛化性能提供了新的理论基础和工具。

Abstract: We extend the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG) framework into a comprehensive
graph-theoretic model for understanding deep ReLU networks. In this model, each
node represents a linear activation region, and edges connect regions that
differ by a single ReLU activation flip, forming a discrete geometric structure
over the network's functional behavior. We prove that RTGs at random
initialization exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and
spectral properties that tightly govern generalization. These structural
insights enable new bounds on capacity via region entropy and on generalization
via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence. Empirically, we construct RTGs
for small networks, measure their smoothness and connectivity properties, and
validate theoretical predictions. Our results show that region entropy
saturates under overparameterization, spectral gap correlates with
generalization, and KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional
smoothness. This work provides a unified framework for analyzing ReLU networks
through the lens of discrete functional geometry, offering new tools to
understand, diagnose, and improve generalization.

Motivation: 解决LLM在多领域理由任务中遇到的高质量验证数据稀缺和人工监督成本高的挑战

Method: 构建了两个核心组件：LoongBench（包含8,729个人工审核示例的种子数据集）和LoongEnv（模块化合成数据生成环境），形成代理-环境循环进行强化学习

Result: 在广泛的开源和专有LLM上进行了基准测试，评估了领域覆盖范围和性能瓶颈，并对合成数据进行了正确性、难度和多样性分析

Conclusion: Loong框架为多领域理由能力培训提供了可扩展的合成数据生成和验证方案，有助于解决高质量数据稀缺问题

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their
reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like
mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be
automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other
reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In
this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for
scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of
reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)
LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples
across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired
with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic
data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to
produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an
agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based
agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align
with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad
suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and
reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,
difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DHCP的分层深度强化学习模型，用于交通信号控制，通过高层代理分配南北和东西方向的总周期时间，低层代理进一步分配直行和左转的时间，解决了传统方法在相位选择和安全性与效率之间的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度强化学习交通信号控制方法存在两种主要范式："选择相位"可能导致不可预测的相位序列影响驾驶员预期和安全，而"切换"范式虽然保持可预测性但可能导致不公平和低效的相位分配。需要一种既能保持可预测性又能灵活分配时间的方法。

Method: 提出了Deep Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP)模型，采用分层控制策略：高层代理根据整体交通状态分配南北和东西方向的总周期时间，低层代理在各自主要方向内进一步分配直行和左转运动的时间，实现更灵活的时间分配。

Result: 在真实和合成的道路网络以及多组真实和合成的交通流数据上进行测试，实证结果显示该模型在所有数据集上都优于基线方法，取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: DHCP模型通过分层周期规划的方法，有效解决了传统交通信号控制方法在安全性、可预测性和效率之间的权衡问题，为智能交通信号控制提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic
signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex
traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control
paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in
the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this
paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their
anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,
the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next
predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a
more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase
allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while
others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep
Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle
duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the
total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions
based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the
allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn
movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our
model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of
real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the
best performance over all datasets against baselines.

Motivation: 解决传统TDCR多核素分析中自动化程度低、依赖混合物标准的问题，特别是在标准源不易获得的情况下

Method: 采用Geant4模拟生成β谱，结合统计检测器响应金样，训练特制神经网络学习各种核素混比和滑灭场景

Conclusion: 该AI驱动方法具有强大的演绎能力、实时处理能力和工程可行性，特别适用于标准材料缺乏或需要快速现场分析的场景

Abstract: Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is
widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of
its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability,
and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide
analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on
mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral
simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\beta$
spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with
statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network
architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and
quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide
activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The
model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions
(mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error =
0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998),
validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\beta$ spectroscopy. This
AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated
safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization,
real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in
scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is
required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可解释AI在安全关键应用中至关重要，但Rashomon效应导致多个准确模型提供分析的解释，挑战了XAI的可靠性。需要实证量化这种效应在自动驾驶行为预测中的影响。

Method: 使用谨解释性图形(QXGs)作为符号场景表示，训练两类模型的Rashomon集合：可解释的基于对的梯度提升模型和复杂的图神经网络(GNNs)，通过特征归因方法测量内部和类间解释一致性。

Result: 发现显著的解释不一致性，不同模型在相同准确性下产生异质解释，说明解释模糊性不仅仅是模型工艺的产物。

Conclusion: 解释模糊性是自动驾驶行为预测问题的内在特性，Rashomon效应对XAI的可靠性构成重大挑战，需要在安全关键应用中重视这一问题。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for validating and trusting models in
safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, the reliability
of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate
models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper
provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of
action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable
Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two
distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and
complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution
methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these
classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings
suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not
just a modeling artifact.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个无阈值评估框架(AUC-IoU)来解决归因方法评估中的阈值选择偏差问题，通过在完整阈值谱上计算性能，避免了单阈值评估导致的矛盾结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前归因方法评估存在阈值选择偏差，单一阈值选择可以改变方法排名超过200个百分点，这削弱了评估结论的可靠性。

Method: 开发了阈值无关的评估框架，计算交并比曲线下面积(AUC-IoU)，捕捉归因质量在整个阈值谱上的表现。

Result: 在皮肤镜图像上评估7种归因方法，显示单阈值指标产生矛盾结果，而无阈值评估提供可靠区分。XRAI比LIME提升31%，比普通积分梯度提升204%。

Conclusion: 该框架建立了消除评估伪影的方法学标准，为医学影像及其他领域的稳健比较提供了理论洞见和实践指导。

Abstract: Attribution methods explain neural network predictions by identifying
influential input features, but their evaluation suffers from threshold
selection bias that can reverse method rankings and undermine conclusions.
Current protocols binarize attribution maps at single thresholds, where
threshold choice alone can alter rankings by over 200 percentage points. We
address this flaw with a threshold-free framework that computes Area Under the
Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU), capturing attribution quality
across the full threshold spectrum. Evaluating seven attribution methods on
dermatological imaging, we show single-threshold metrics yield contradictory
results, while threshold-free evaluation provides reliable differentiation.
XRAI achieves 31% improvement over LIME and 204% over vanilla Integrated
Gradients, with size-stratified analysis revealing performance variations up to
269% across lesion scales. These findings establish methodological standards
that eliminate evaluation artifacts and enable evidence-based method selection.
The threshold-free framework provides both theoretical insight into attribution
behavior and practical guidance for robust comparison in medical imaging and
beyond.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted
Network (TabPFN) - a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data - to
geotechnical site characterization problems defined in the GEOAI benchmark
BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025. Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the
spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth
profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site
dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning
setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional
context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that
TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and
well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional
hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant
gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction),
TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an
order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical
parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target
parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative
computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time
inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation
model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in
probabilistic site characterization.

Conclusion: 论文扩展了公平性决策树的设计空间，证明了第二和第三种方法的可行性和价值，为该领域提供了更多的设计选择和研究方向。

Abstract: Decision trees have been studied extensively in the context of fairness,
aiming to maximize prediction performance while ensuring non-discrimination
against different groups. Techniques in this space usually focus on imposing
constraints at training time, constraining the search space so that solutions
which display unacceptable values of relevant metrics are not considered,
discarded, or discouraged. If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive
attribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as
follows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function
that is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on
the weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)
The second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function
in y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the
objective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting
a further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y
fails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is
to backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.
(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for
s, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared. In this
way, information regarding y and regarding s can be used independently, without
having to constrain the choices in tree construction by the mutual information
between the two variables. Quite surprisingly, of the three options, only the
first one and the greedy variant of the second have been studied in the
literature so far. In this paper, we introduce the above two additional options
from that design space and characterize them experimentally on multiple
datasets.

Motivation: 解决GCSL框架中存在的两大问题：1)仅从自我生成经验学习会加剧机器人偏见；2)重新标签策略使得机器人只关注成功结果，无法从失败中学习

Method: 在GCSL框架中集成对比学习原理，让机器人同时从成功和失败的经验中学习

Result: 算法克服了机器人初始偏见的限制，促进了更多的探索行为，在多个具有挑战性的环境中实现了更优的性能

Conclusion: 通过从成功和失败两方面学习，该方法有效提升了自主系统的学习效果和性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning faces significant challenges when applied to tasks
characterized by sparse reward structures. Although imitation learning, within
the domain of supervised learning, offers faster convergence, it relies heavily
on human-generated demonstrations. Recently, Goal-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (GCSL) has emerged as a potential solution by enabling self-imitation
learning for autonomous systems. By strategically relabelling goals, agents can
derive policy insights from their own experiences. Despite the successes of
this framework, it presents two notable limitations: (1) Learning exclusively
from self-generated experiences can exacerbate the agents' inherent biases; (2)
The relabelling strategy allows agents to focus solely on successful outcomes,
precluding them from learning from their mistakes. To address these issues, we
propose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the
GCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by
agents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior. This
facilitates the identification and adoption of effective policies, leading to
superior performance across a variety of challenging environments.

TL;DR: TeRA是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过张量网络实现高秩权重更新，同时保持向量化方法的参数效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LoRA风格适配器在高表达性和参数效率之间的权衡问题，高秩适配器需要更多参数，而向量化方法参数效率高但表达性有限

Method: 使用Tucker-like张量网络参数化权重更新矩阵，冻结大型随机初始化因子并在层间共享，仅训练由对角因子矩阵条目组成的小型层特定缩放向量

Result: TeRA匹配甚至超越高秩适配器的性能，同时只需要与向量化方法相似的训练参数量

Conclusion: TeRA成功实现了高秩权重更新与参数效率的平衡，理论分析和实验验证了该方法的有效性

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style
adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model
expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter
reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches
present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates
typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency
offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a
vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for
high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel
PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the
parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by
parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor
network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared
across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by
entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively
decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable
parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even
outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count
similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 传统评估指标如F1和F1_pa在真实不平衡数据集上时常导致模型性能评估偏差，特别是当地面真实为单点注释而实际现象是渐进性时

Method: 提出窗口基于F1指标(F1_w)，包含时间宽容机制，在三个生理数据集上进行实证分析，包括两个野外数据集和一个实验室数据集

Result: F1_w能够显示传统指标无法发现的有意义模型性能模式，在TimesFM预测中只有时间宽容指标能显示统计显著的改善

Conclusion: 评估指标的选择强烈影响模型性能的解释，F1_w指标填补了时间序列评估的关键空白，为健康领域应用提供了实用指南

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for
applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground
truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying
phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and
point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such
real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$)
that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of
event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in
three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one
experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance
patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be
adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of
evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance:
using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal
statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the
two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series
evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where
requirements for temporal precision vary by context.

Abstract: The increasing demand for high data rates and seamless connectivity in
wireless systems has sparked significant interest in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) and artificial intelligence-based wireless applications. RIS
typically comprises passive reflective antenna elements that control the
wireless propagation environment by adequately tuning the phase of the
reflective elements. The allocation of RIS elements to multipleuser equipment
(UEs) is crucial for efficiently utilizing RIS. In this work, we formulate a
joint optimization problem that optimizes the RIS phase configuration and
resource allocation under an $\alpha$-fair scheduling framework and propose an
efficient way of allocating RIS elements. Conventional iterative optimization
methods, however, suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity
as the number of RIS elements increases and also complicate the generation of
training labels for supervised learning. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a five-layer fully connected neural network (FNN) combined with a
preprocessing technique to significantly reduce input dimensionality, lower
computational complexity, and enhance scalability. The simulation results show
that our proposed NN-based solution reduces computational overhead while
significantly improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing RIS
element allocation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves better
performance while reducing computational complexity, making it significantly
more scalable than the iterative optimization algorithms.

Motivation: 现有深度学习测试方法主要关注特定故障特征，而忽略了特征空间中其他区域的故障特征，需要一种系统性的方法来对输入特征空间进行全面映射和分组。

Method: 采用降维技术获得输入嵌入，然后进行聚类分析，使用深度神经网络作为人工评估器的近似来自动选择最优的嵌入/聚类配置，生成输入空间的拓扑地图。

Result: TopoMap生成的拓扑地图包含可区分且有意义的区域，在突变分析中，对可杀死突变体的选择效果比随机选择平均提高35%，对不可杀死突变体提高61%。

Conclusion: TopoMap提供了一种有效的方法来系统性地映射深度学习模型的输入特征空间，能够识别不同的故障特征区域，显著提高了突变测试的效率。

Abstract: Testing Deep Learning (DL)-based systems is an open challenge. Although it is
relatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping
of inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely
unexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may
focus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that
belong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an
explicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named
TopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features
that characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the
specific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain
input embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might
require specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a
meaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel
way to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering
techniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human
evaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based
on the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically
select the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are
produced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation
results show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and
meaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using
mutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our
topographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%
on average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones.

Conclusion: FoMEMO通过合成数据预训练的基础模型实现了对未知问题的卓越适应性，为昂贵多目标优化提供了高效且通用的解决方案

Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in
many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited
evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing
works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for
each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past
domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to
generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the
real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO
(Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables
the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory
and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the
predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing
extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that
pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of
synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without
necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization
process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and
real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive
performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 结构转移是一个系统无关的计算法，可在广泛的实际场景中识别替代表示，为解决表示转换问题提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to
communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this
paper, is how to devise \textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}
techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a
novel calculus, called \textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation
transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \textit{source}
representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us
to generate a \textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of
structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source
representation and the generated target representation satisfy \textit{any}
specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting
\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can
express \textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair
of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure
for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We
formalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\cite{raggi2022rst},
building on the key concept of a \textit{construction space}. The abstract
nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of
diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as
well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a
system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative
representations in a wide range of practical settings.

TL;DR: HyPV-LEAD是一个用于加密货币异常交易检测的早期预警框架，通过窗口-视野建模、峰谷采样和双曲嵌入技术，在比特币交易数据上实现了0.9624的PR-AUC性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币异常交易（如混币服务、欺诈转账和拉盘砸盘）对金融完整性构成日益严重的风险，但由于类别不平衡、时间波动性和复杂网络依赖关系，检测异常交易非常困难。现有方法主要是模型中心化和事后检测，只能在异常发生后进行标记，预防价值有限。

Method: HyPV-LEAD框架集成了三个创新：(1)窗口-视野建模确保可操作的提前预警；(2)峰谷采样缓解类别不平衡同时保持时间连续性；(3)双曲嵌入捕捉区块链交易网络的层次结构和无标度特性。

Result: 在大规模比特币交易数据上的实证评估表明，HyPV-LEAD始终优于最先进的基线方法，实现了0.9624的PR-AUC，在精确率和召回率方面都有显著提升。消融研究证实每个组件都提供了互补的益处。

Conclusion: 通过将异常检测从反应式分类转变为主动式早期预警，HyPV-LEAD为实时风险管理、反洗钱合规和动态区块链环境中的金融安全建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent
transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial
integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance,
temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are
predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they
occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces
HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a
data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into
anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three
innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time
alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while
preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the
hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.
Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that
HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation
studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic
embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,
with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly
detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD
establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money
laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain
environments.

Abstract: Missing data represents a fundamental challenge in machine learning
applications, often reducing model performance and reliability. This problem is
particularly acute in fields like bioinformatics and clinical machine learning,
where datasets are frequently incomplete due to the nature of both data
generation and data collection. While numerous imputation methods exist, from
simple statistical techniques to advanced deep learning models, no single
method consistently performs well across diverse datasets and missingness
mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Meta-Imputation approach that learns to
combine the outputs of multiple base imputers to predict missing values more
accurately. By training the proposed method called Meta-Imputation Balanced
(MIB) on synthetically masked data with known ground truth, the system learns
to predict the most suitable imputed value based on the behavior of each
method. Our work highlights the potential of ensemble learning in imputation
and paves the way for more robust, modular, and interpretable preprocessing
pipelines in real-world machine learning systems.

Abstract: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely
used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design
depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by
engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields
suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper
introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding
agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We
formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are
represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and
iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)
and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate
that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average
delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and
incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting
cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green
allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.
This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design
in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation
engineering.

Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple
coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking.
Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity,
averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In
this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model
the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables
direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries
through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that
aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate
learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of
systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams
and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching
significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in
capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering
a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in
high-dimensional systems.

Motivation: 虽然GANs和扩散模型都可以在差分隐私下训练以保护敏感数据，但它们对成员推理攻击的敏感性仍然未被充分理解，这是数据机密性的关键威胁。

Method: 通过稳定性分析比较GANs和扩散模型对数据扰动的敏感性，并使用标准化的MIA流程进行全面的实证研究，评估不同数据集和隐私预算下的隐私泄露情况。

Result: 研究结果显示GANs表现出显著较低的隐私泄露风险，即使在强差分隐私机制下，GANs相对于扩散模型存在明显的隐私鲁棒性差距。

Conclusion: 模型类型本身可以关键性地影响隐私泄露程度，GANs在抵抗成员推理攻击方面具有结构优势，这为选择隐私保护的生成模型提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as
leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained
under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality,
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified
theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially
private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based
analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data
perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in
resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical
study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across
datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy
robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that
model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

Conclusion: 生成式与预测式模型结合的方法可辅助表位发现，仅需氨基酸序列，无需几何框架或手工特征，有望实现更快、更经济的合成表位生成和筛选

Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by
antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of
immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of
synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial
sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,
making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental
techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,
pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,
which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,
which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of
known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of
epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to
predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus
narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying
specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and
predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses
only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a
geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a
method to create biologically feasible sequences, we anticipate faster and more
cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes, with relevant
applications in the development of new biotechnologies.

TL;DR: Fair-Synergy是一个开源算法框架，通过利用智能体准确性与系统资源之间的凹关系，在多智能体系统中实现公平资源分配，在推理和学习任务中分别比基准方法提升25%和11%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统资源分配方法往往忽视智能体不同的计算能力和复杂操作环境，导致资源分配效率低下且不公平，需要新的公平分配框架来优化云辅助多智能体智能的性能。

Method: 开发了Fair-Synergy算法框架，扩展传统分配方法以涵盖由模型参数、训练数据量和任务复杂性定义的多维机器学习效用景观，利用智能体准确性与系统资源之间的凹关系来确保公平分配。

Result: 在BERT、VGG16、MobileNet、ResNets等先进视觉和语言模型上，使用MNIST、CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、BDD和GLUE数据集进行评估，Fair-Synergy在多智能体推理中比标准基准提升25%，在多智能体学习中提升11%。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了整体性能，还探索了公平性水平对最弱势、最优势和平均智能体的影响，为公平的舰队智能提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of
cloud-assisted multi-agent intelligence. Traditional methods often overlook
agents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments,
leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we
open-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave
relationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure
fair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional
allocation approaches to encompass a multidimensional machine learning utility
landscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task
complexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models
such as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy
outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11%
in multi-agent learning settings. Also, we explore how the level of fairness
affects the least advantaged, most advantaged, and average agents, providing
insights for equitable fleet intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究分析61个国家的平均睡眠时长，发现夏令时制实施国家的睡眠时长平均更长，但这种影响受纬度调节：低纬度地区DST国家睡眠更短，高纬度地区更长


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索夏令时制对不同国家睡眠时长的影响，以及纬度在这一关系中的调节作用

Method: 收集61个国家的睡眠数据，进行统计相关分析，按夏令时制实施情况分组，通过可视化比较不同组别的睡眠模式

Result: DST实施国家平均睡眠时长更长，但纬度有显著调节作用：低纬度地区DST国家睡眠更短，高纬度地区DST国家睡眠更长

Conclusion: 夏令时制对睡眠的影响受到地理位置的调节，纬度是重要的调节因素

Abstract: In this study we analyzed average sleep durations across 61 countries to
examine the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) practices. Key metrics
influencing sleep were identified, and statistical correlation analysis was
applied to explore relationships among these factors. Countries were grouped
based on DST observance, and visualizations compared sleep patterns between DST
and non-DST regions. Results show that, on average, countries observing DST
tend to report longer sleep durations than those that do not. A more detailed
pattern emerged when accounting for latitude: at lower latitudes, DST-observing
countries reported shorter sleep durations compared to non-DST countries, while
at higher latitudes, DST-observing countries reported longer average sleep
durations. These findings suggest that the influence of DST on sleep may be
moderated by geographical location.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探索了使用图神经网络学习来处理流感病人数据，通过异质图模型和自动化强化学习为流感病人提供液体治疗和升压药决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流感是一种严重的生命危空情况，在治疗过程中确定正确的静脉液体和升压药用量非常具有挑战性。虽然自动化强化学习方法已经取得了有望的成果，但以往研究依赖关系数据，而图数据表示可能提供更自然和有效的方法。

Method: 研究将MIMIC-III数据集中的病人数据建模为时间演化的异质图，使用GraphSAGE和GATv2两种图神经网络架构学习病人状态表征。采用表征学习与策略学习解耦的方法，编码器与预测下一病人状态的解码器联合训练生成潜在状态表征，然后使用dBCQ算法进行策略学习。

Result: 实验评估结果证实了图基方法的潜力，同时也显示了在这个领域进行表征学习的复杂性。

Conclusion: 图神经网络在流感病人数据表征学习方面具有潜力，但这个领域的表征学习任务非常复杂，需要进一步研究和优化。

Abstract: Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is
challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and
vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising
results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity
of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more
natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the
well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time.
Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and
GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of
decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are
trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that
predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy
learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation
confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the
complexity of representation learning in this domain.

TL;DR: PROF是一种数据过程筛选方法，通过过程一致性过滤协调细粒度过程奖励和粗粒度结果奖励，提升数学推理任务的强化学习效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法中，结果奖励模型(ORM)过于粗粒度无法区分正确答案中的错误推理或错误答案中的有效推理，而过程奖励模型(PRM)虽然提供细粒度指导但存在不准确性和奖励攻击问题

Method: 提出PROF方法，通过一致性驱动的样本选择来协调PRM和ORM的互补优势，保留具有较高平均过程值的正确响应和较低平均过程值的错误响应，同时保持正负训练样本平衡

Result: 实验表明该方法相比混合方法持续提升最终准确率超过4%，同时增强了中间推理步骤的质量

Conclusion: PROF通过有效的数据过程筛选方法成功解决了细粒度过程奖励和粗粒度结果奖励之间的协调问题，显著提升了数学推理任务的性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged to be a
predominant paradigm for mathematical reasoning tasks, offering stable
improvements in reasoning ability. However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in
RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct
answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity
introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further
progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer
fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from
inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.
  To resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an
effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained
process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than
naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function
(arXiv:archive/2506.18896), PROF leverages their complementary strengths
through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct
responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with
lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training
sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only
consistently improves the final accuracy over $4\%$ compared to the blending
approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs作为一种新兴的神经网络架构，虽然已在科学和机器学习任务中成功应用，但其初始化策略尚未得到充分研究，需要系统性的初始化方法研究来提升性能。

Method: 提出了两种理论驱动的初始化方案（LeCun和Glorot启发）和一个可调指数的经验幂律初始化家族，通过大规模网格搜索在函数拟合和前向PDE基准上进行评估，并结合神经正切核分析训练动态。

Result: 研究发现Glorot启发的初始化在参数丰富的模型中显著优于基线，而幂律初始化在整体性能和不同规模架构上都取得了最强性能。

Conclusion: 本文为KANs提供了有效的初始化策略，Glorot初始化适合参数丰富的模型，幂律初始化在整体性能上表现最佳，所有代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a recently introduced neural
architecture that replace fixed nonlinearities with trainable activation
functions, offering enhanced flexibility and interpretability. While KANs have
been applied successfully across scientific and machine learning tasks, their
initialization strategies remain largely unexplored. In this work, we study
initialization schemes for spline-based KANs, proposing two theory-driven
approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot, as well as an empirical power-law
family with tunable exponents. Our evaluation combines large-scale grid
searches on function fitting and forward PDE benchmarks, an analysis of
training dynamics through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel, and
evaluations on a subset of the Feynman dataset. Our findings indicate that the
Glorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms the baseline in
parameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest
performance overall, both across tasks and for architectures of varying size.

TL;DR: LINKER是首个基于序列的模型，仅使用蛋白质序列和配体SMILES即可预测残基-功能基团相互作用类型，无需3D结构输入


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖3D结构输入或基于距离的接触标签，限制了应用范围和生物学相关性

Method: 使用结构监督的注意力机制，通过功能基团基序提取从3D蛋白-配体复合物获得交互标签，将配体结构抽象为功能基团

Result: 在LP-PDBBind基准测试中，基于功能基团抽象的结构监督能产生与真实生化注释高度一致的交互相测

Conclusion: LINKER仅需序列级输入即可实现大规模应用，特别适用于结构数据不可用的情况

Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand
functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide
rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand
interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based
contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We
introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional
group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using
only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with
structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D
protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By
abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on
chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather
than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level
input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where
structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark
demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group
abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth
biochemical annotations.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法主要局限于静态自由落体环境或简单操作设置，忽略了与动态移动刚体的复杂交互，需要开发能处理液体-刚体交互的动力学学习框架。

Method: 使用GNN框架，将粒子表示为图节点，采用BVH算法处理粒子-物体碰撞，利用表面表示来建模液体粒子与复杂几何表面的交互。

Conclusion: 该GNN框架成功解决了液体与刚体复杂交互的动力学学习问题，展示了在控制和操作任务中应用梯度优化方法的潜力。

Abstract: Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving
real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics,
and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on
graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.
However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in
static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving
primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically
moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed
from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body
interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph
nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations
with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the
network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate
surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic
settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.
Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our
model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel
manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the
learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using
gradient-based optimization methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化技术能大幅减少DP-SGD训练的时间和能耗，但研究发现量化会导致DP-SGD比普通SGD更严重的精度下降，这是因为噪声注入放大了量化方差。

Method: 提出QPQuant动态量化框架：1）概率性采样层轮换量化；2）使用差分隐私损失敏感度估计器进行损失感知层优先级排序，选择对模型质量影响最小的层进行量化。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验表明，QPQuant优于静态量化基线，达到接近帕累托最优的精度-计算权衡，理论吞吐量提升达2.21倍，验证精度下降小于2%。

Conclusion: QPQuant通过动态量化策略有效解决了DP-SGD中量化导致的精度下降问题，在保持差分隐私保护的同时显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Differentially-Private SGD (DP-SGD) is a powerful technique to protect user
privacy when using sensitive data to train neural networks. During training,
converting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,
quantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and
cost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that
quantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD
compared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in
DP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately
large accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a
dynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of
layers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that
effectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the
layers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware
layer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity
estimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model
quality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy
budget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,
and DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant
consistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near
Pareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical
throughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in
validation accuracy.

Motivation: 为之前提出的TwF方法提供严格的理论基础，证明其参数子空间的几何结构特性，超越一阶近似的理论保证

Method: 通过数学分析证明在非奇异控制条件下，TwF的参数子空间构成有限余维Banach子流形，并精确刻画其切空间结构

Result: 证明了TwF的参数子空间具有Banach子流形结构，其切空间对应控制函数沿该子流形切空间的连续变形，能够精确保持先前学习样本的端点映射

Conclusion: TwF方法具有坚实的数学理论基础，能够在顺序训练中精确实现映射保持（不遗忘），而不仅仅是一阶近似意义下的保持

Abstract: In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting
(TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added
iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions
that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the
manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this
letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of
finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent
space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the
control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing
a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the
sequential training exactly, beyond first-order approximation.

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The
advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein
foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding
and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has
raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating
proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the
first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best
of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and
heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct
tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which
includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a
comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks
on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate
for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein
foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security
protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly

Motivation: 传统熵正则化方法在机器人控制和游戏RL中有效，但在LLM-RL训练中效果有限，主要原因是LLM响应空间极大且最优输出稀疏。

Method: 提出AEnt方法：1）使用钳制熵奖励，在更小的标记空间上定义重归一化策略；2）自动调整熵系数，根据钳制熵值动态控制熵诱导偏差。

Result: 在多个基础模型和数据集上的数学推理任务测试中，AEnt方法始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: AEnt方法有效解决了LLM-RL中熵控制的问题，通过紧凑响应集探索和自动系数调整，显著提升了训练效果。

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their
effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy
regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including
PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic
and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in
LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL
setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy
regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the
sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy
control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically
adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized
policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration
within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically
adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively
controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.
AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and
datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently
across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurately obtaining crop type and its spatial distribution at a global scale
is critical for food security, agricultural policy-making, and sustainable
development. Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop
classification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many
regions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address
performance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote
sensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes
strategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a
global crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries
across five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,
soybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,
CropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,
and cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal
multi-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic
coefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization
under spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and
robust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal
data augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that
simulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median
temporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance
across all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,
particularly when training data diversity is limited. Overall, the work
identifies more invariant feature representations that enhance geographic
transferability and suggests a promising path toward scalable, low-cost crop
type applications across globally diverse regions.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across numerous edge
devices without requiring participants to share data; however, memory and
communication constraints on these edge devices may preclude their
participation in training. We consider a setting in which a subset of edge
devices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to
conduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these
devices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and
increases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method
used for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to
zeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order
optimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to
correct. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,
ZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.
ZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction
techniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource
clients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp
eliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the
server and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the
up-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various
datasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm
that can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with
a high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from
training, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of
data, thus improving training outcomes.

Motivation: 实现通用智能需要基于语言、物理世界和结构化数据的互补基础模型，当前缺乏专门处理结构化数据的基础模型

Conclusion: LimiX展示了结构化数据基础模型的可行性，为通用智能发展提供了重要组件，所有模型已开源

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

Conclusion: 研究为AI伦理讨论做出贡献，揭示了在高风险环境中部署LLM的风险，并提出了潜在的安全保障措施，有助于开发更可信的AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications
raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional
falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM
knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains
underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior
of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical
scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the
neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal
interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control
deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce
behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying
tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task
performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal
optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,
shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in
high-stakes environments. Code and more illustrations are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统高保真氏求解器在参数空间计算成本过高的问题，将数据驱动学习与物理约束相结合

Conclusion: 提出的LC-prior GP框架能够高效处理复杂几何形状上的多耦合变量问题，将物理约束与数据驱动方法有效结合

Abstract: Parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental mathematical
tools for modeling complex physical systems, yet their numerical evaluation
across parameter spaces remains computationally intensive when using
conventional high-fidelity solvers. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel physical law-corrected prior Gaussian process (LC-prior GP) surrogate
modeling framework that effectively integrates data-driven learning with
underlying physical constraints to flexibly handle multi-coupled variables
defined on complex geometries. The proposed approach leverages proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD) to parameterize high-dimensional PDE solutions
via their dominant modes and associated coefficients, thereby enabling
efficient Gaussian process (GP) surrogate modeling within a reduced-dimensional
coefficient space. A key contribution lies in the incorporation of physical
laws together with a limited number of parameter samples to correct the GP
posterior mean, thus avoiding reliance on computationally expensive numerical
solvers. Furthermore, interpolation functions are constructed to describe the
mapping from the full parameter space to the physics-based correction term.
This mapping is subsequently backpropagated to constrain the original GP
surrogate, yielding a more physically consistent conditional prior. To handle
irregular geometries, the radial basis function-finite difference (RBF-FD)
method is incorporated during training set computation, with its inherent
differentiation matrices providing both computational efficiency and numerical
accuracy for physical constraint optimization. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments involving a
reaction-diffusion model, miscible flooding models, and Navier-Stokes equations
with multi-physics coupling defined on irregular domains.

Result: 在Sobolev核回归、物理信息回归和加性模型中实例化，达到最小最大收敛率，可处理数百亿样本

Conclusion: 建立了一个灵活的方法，为核方法在大规模学习任务中的常规应用铺平了道路

Abstract: Kernel methods are powerful tools in statistical learning, but their cubic
complexity in the sample size n limits their use on large-scale datasets. In
this work, we introduce a scalable framework for kernel regression with O(n log
n) complexity, fully leveraging GPU acceleration. The approach is based on a
Fourier representation of kernels combined with non-uniform fast Fourier
transforms (NUFFT), enabling exact, fast, and memory-efficient computations. We
instantiate our framework in three settings: Sobolev kernel regression,
physics-informed regression, and additive models. When known, the proposed
estimators are shown to achieve minimax convergence rates, consistent with
classical kernel theory. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods can
process up to tens of billions of samples within minutes, providing both
statistical accuracy and computational scalability. These contributions
establish a flexible approach, paving the way for the routine application of
kernel methods in large-scale learning tasks.

Motivation: 基于流的生成模型在处理具有多尺度傅里叶频谱的科学数据时，往往在细尺度特征上产生较大误差，需要改进噪声分布和插值策略来提高建模效果。

Method: 在随机插值框架下，通过原则性设计噪声分布和插值调度：1）使用与目标数据频谱衰减率匹配的噪声；2）对于复杂非高斯分布，开发尺度自适应插值调度来处理数值病态问题。

Conclusion: 通过噪声频谱匹配和自适应插值调度的原则性设计，能够有效解决多尺度科学数据建模中的细尺度特征误差问题，提高基于流生成模型的数值效率和样本质量。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models can face significant challenges when modeling
scientific data with multiscale Fourier spectra, often producing large errors
in fine-scale features. We address this problem within the framework of
stochastic interpolants, via principled design of noise distributions and
interpolation schedules. The key insight is that the noise should not be
smoother than the target data distribution -- measured by Fourier spectrum
decay rates -- to ensure bounded drift fields near the initial time. For
Gaussian and near-Gaussian distributions whose fine-scale structure is known,
we show that spectrum-matched noise improves numerical efficiency compared to
standard white-noise approaches. For complex non-Gaussian distributions, we
develop scale-adaptive interpolation schedules that address the numerical
ill-conditioning arising from rougher-than-data noise. Numerical experiments on
synthetic Gaussian random fields and solutions to the stochastic Allen-Cahn and
Navier-Stokes equations validate our approach and demonstrate its ability to
generate high-fidelity samples at lower computational cost than traditional
approaches.

Motivation: BART模型虽然准确但缺乏可解释性，需要一种既能保持预测精度又能提供更好解释性的改进方法。

Method: 基于函数ANOVA分解的ANOVA-BART，将函数变异性分解为不同交互作用，每个代表不同协变量集的贡献。

Result: ANOVA-BART的后验集中率接近极小极大最优，为每个交互作用提供收敛率，在准确性和不确定性量化方面超越BART。

Conclusion: ANOVA-BART通过平衡预测准确性、可解释性和理论一致性，成为BART的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a powerful statistical model
that leverages the strengths of Bayesian inference and regression trees. It has
received significant attention for capturing complex non-linear relationships
and interactions among predictors. However, the accuracy of BART often comes at
the cost of interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose ANOVA
Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (ANOVA-BART), a novel extension of BART
based on the functional ANOVA decomposition, which is used to decompose the
variability of a function into different interactions, each representing the
contribution of a different set of covariates or factors. Our proposed
ANOVA-BART enhances interpretability, preserves and extends the theoretical
guarantees of BART, and achieves superior predictive performance. Specifically,
we establish that the posterior concentration rate of ANOVA-BART is nearly
minimax optimal, and further provides the same convergence rates for each
interaction that are not available for BART. Moreover, comprehensive
experiments confirm that ANOVA-BART surpasses BART in both accuracy and
uncertainty quantification, while also demonstrating its effectiveness in
component selection. These results suggest that ANOVA-BART offers a compelling
alternative to BART by balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and
theoretical consistency.

Motivation: 现有研究主要通过Frobenius范数分析Shampoo的估计方案，但二阶矩与协方差矩阵的自然联系促使作者从KL最小化的角度重新审视其估计问题

Method: 提出基于KL散度最小化的协方差估计视角，开发KL-Shampoo实用估计方案，消除对Adam稳定化的依赖

Result: 初步结果显示KL-Shampoo改进了Shampoo性能，无需Adam即可稳定，在神经网络预训练中甚至优于Adam稳定变体SOAP

Conclusion: KL散度视角揭示了Shampoo的隐藏局限性，KL-Shampoo方案不仅移除了额外内存开销，还实现了更好的性能表现

Abstract: As an adaptive method, Shampoo employs a structured second-moment estimation,
and its effectiveness has attracted growing attention. Prior work has primarily
analyzed its estimation scheme through the Frobenius norm. Motivated by the
natural connection between the second moment and a covariance matrix, we
propose studying Shampoo's estimation as covariance estimation through the lens
of Kullback-Leibler (KL) minimization. This alternative perspective reveals a
previously hidden limitation, motivating improvements to Shampoo's design.
Building on this insight, we develop a practical estimation scheme, termed
KL-Shampoo, that eliminates Shampoo's reliance on Adam for stabilization,
thereby removing the additional memory overhead introduced by Adam. Preliminary
results show that KL-Shampoo improves Shampoo's performance, enabling it to
stabilize without Adam and even outperform its Adam-stabilized variant, SOAP,
in neural network pretraining.

Motivation: 解决直接优化结果总和的非线性函数的问题，这种问题不等价于最大化单个贡献的期望值，如在A/B测试中最大化超过指定提升的成功概率。

Method: 利用结果总和的聚集性质，推导出一种可扩展的梯度下降算法，直接优化非线性函数目标。

Result: 算法能够直接优化非线性函数目标，在A/B测试等场景中有效最大化成功概率，而不仅仅是最大化期望收益。

Conclusion: 通过利用聚集性质提出的可扩展梯度下降算法，有效解决了直接优化非线性函数目标的问题，在实际应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: We consider the problem of directly optimizing a non-linear function of an
outcome, where this outcome itself is the sum of many small contributions. The
non-linearity of the function means that the problem is not equivalent to the
maximization of the expectation of the individual contribution. By leveraging
the concentration properties of the sum of individual outcomes, we derive a
scalable descent algorithm that directly optimizes for our stated objective.
This allows for instance to maximize the probability of successful A/B test,
for which it can be wiser to target a success criterion, such as exceeding a
given uplift, rather than chasing the highest expected payoff.

Conclusion: 开发大动作空间OPL算法时必须明确考虑优化因素，简单的加权对数似然方法在实际应用中可能比复杂估计器更有效。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) and off-policy learning (OPL) are foundational
for decision-making in offline contextual bandits. Recent advances in OPL
primarily optimize OPE estimators with improved statistical properties,
assuming that better estimators inherently yield superior policies. Although
theoretically justified, we argue this estimator-centric approach neglects a
critical practical obstacle: challenging optimization landscapes. In this
paper, we provide theoretical insights and extensive empirical evidence showing
that current OPL methods encounter severe optimization issues, particularly as
action spaces become large. We demonstrate that simpler weighted log-likelihood
objectives enjoy substantially better optimization properties and still recover
competitive, often superior, learned policies. Our findings emphasize the
necessity of explicitly addressing optimization considerations in the
development of OPL algorithms for large action spaces.
