Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a disruptive
technology for future wireless networks. To investigate their capabilities, we
study the sum rate maximization problem in an SIM-based multiuser (MU)
multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink system. A vast majority of pioneer
studies, if not all, address this fundamental problem using the prevailing
alternating optimization (AO) framework, where the digital beamforming (DB) and
SIM phase shifts are optimized alternately. However, many of these approaches
suffer from suboptimal performance, quickly leading to performance saturation,
when the number of SIM layers increases assuming the \emph{fixed SIM
thickness}. In this letter, we demonstrate that significant performance gains
can still be achieved, and such saturation does not occur with the proposed
method in the considered setting. To this end, we provide practical design
guidelines to improve AO-based optimization of digital precoders and SIM phase
shifts. Specifically, we show that (i) optimizing the SIM phase shifts first
yields significant performance improvements, compared to optimizing the DB
first; and (ii) when applying projected gradient (PG) methods, which are
gradually becoming more popular to optimize the phase shifts thanks to their
scalability, we find that using an iterative PG method achieves better
performance than the single PG step, which is commonly used in existing
solutions. Based on these customizations, the proposed method achieves a higher
achievable sum rate (ASR) of up to $\ensuremath{115.53\%}$, compared to
benchmark schemes for the scenarios under consideration.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology holds immense potential
for increasing the performance of wireless networks. Therefore, RIS is also
regarded as one of the solutions to address communication challenges in
high-mobility scenarios, such as Doppler shift and fast fading. This paper
investigates a high-speed train (HST) multiple-input single-output (MISO)
communication system aided by a RIS. We propose a block coordinate descent
(BCD) algorithm to jointly optimize the RIS phase shifts and the transmit
beamforming vectors to maximize the channel gain. Numerical results are
provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the
system performance, achieving an average channel gain improvement of 15 dB
compared to traditional schemes. Additionally, the introduction of RIS
eliminates outage probability and improves key performance metrics such as
achievable rate, channel capacity, and bit error rate (BER). These findings
highlight the critical role of RIS in enhancing HST communication systems.

Abstract: Ongoing discussions about the future of wireless communications are reaching
a turning point as standardization activities for the sixth generation of
mobile networks (6G) become more mature. New technologies must now face renewed
scrutiny by the industry and academia in order to be ready for deployment in
the near future. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) gained
attention as a promising solution for improving the propagation conditions of
signal transmission in general. The RIS is a planar array of tunable resonant
elements designed to dynamically and precisely manipulate the reflection of
incident electromagnetic waves. However, the physical structure of the RIS and
its components may be subject to practical limitations and imperfections. It is
imperative that the hardware imperfections (HWIs) associated with the RIS be
analyzed, so that it remains a feasible technology from a practical standpoint.
Moreover, solutions for mitigating the HWIs must be considered, as is discussed
in this work. More specifically, we introduce a gradient descent optimization
for mitigating HWIs in RIS-aided wideband communication systems. Numerical
results show that the proposed optimization is able to compensate for HWIs such
as the phase-shift noise (PSN) and RIS surface deformations.

Method: 提出RIS配置方法，提供对宽频带信号的频率选择性信号反射

Result: 该方法能够有效处理宽频带信号的反射问题

Conclusion: 所提出的频选反射配置方法有助于解决RIS在宽频带通信系统中的实际应用障碍

Abstract: Recently, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has ushered
in the prospect of control over the wireless propagation environment. By
establishing alternative propagation paths for the transmitted signals, and by
reflecting them in a controllable manner, the RIS is able to improve the signal
reception. However, an aspect often overlooked is the potential bandwidth
restrictions on the wideband signal reflected by the RIS. If not carefully
considered, this can become an impediment for the adoption of the RIS in the
next generation of communications systems. Therefore, in this work we propose a
RIS configuration method that provides frequency selective signal reflection
for wideband signals.

### [5] [On the Compromise Between Performance and Efficiency in RIS-aided Communication Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15599)

Main category: eess.SP

Result: 研究表明，NN方法显著减少了RIS重新配置次数，降低了配置开销。STAR-RIS技术能够增强覆盖范围、提高能效、减少延迟，同时在多个无线场景中提升总速率和物理层安全性。

Conclusion: STAR-RIS技术通过其双功能特性有效解决了传统RIS系统的局限性，为高移动性通信系统提供了更优的解决方案，在性能损失较小的情况下实现了多普勒频移补偿和系统性能的全面提升。

Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology for metasurfaces is
ushering in a new paradigm for wireless communication systems. It provides an
accessible way for controlling the interaction between electromagnetic waves
with the propagation medium. One particularly important aspect is the
configuration of the RIS elements or reflectors. Simply stated, the objective
of the RIS configuration is to choose the optimum phase-shift combination that
maximizes the channel capacity. Recently, neural networks (NNs) were proposed
for tackling this task and results have shown that the proposed NN promotes far
less reconfigurations of the RIS, consequently reducing the configuration
overhead. Beyond that, the RIS can be repurposed for tackling the Doppler shift
in high-mobility communication systems. Despite not being its usual primary
goal, results have also demonstrated that the RIS can compensate for the
Doppler shift at a small cost in performance. However, the typical
reflection-only constraint for RIS systems limits the spatial coverage and
signal amplification potential achieved by such systems. Therefore, the
simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface
(STAR-RIS) can be employed to address these limitations by its dual
functionality of transmitting and reflecting signals concurrently. It can be
shown that the STAR-RIS can augment coverage, energy efficiency, and latency
reduction, while enhancing sum-rate and physical-layer security across several
wireless contexts.

### [6] [Discrete Radar based on Modulo Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15671)
*Nishant Mehrotra,Sandesh Rao Mattu,Saif Khan Mohammed,Ronny Hadani,Robert Calderbank*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Zak-OTFS调制方案用于雷达感知，通过离散海森堡-外尔群和辛变换设计波形，将传统雷达信号处理复杂度从O(B²T²)降低到O(BT log T)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统连续雷达信号处理复杂度高，需要开发更高效的雷达感知方法，利用Zak-OTFS调制架构实现低复杂度的雷达信号处理。

Method: 在延迟-多普勒域形成雷达波形，通过匹配滤波和相关处理生成散射环境图像，利用离散海森堡-外尔群和辛变换进行波形设计，选择最大交换子群的共同特征向量作为雷达波形。

Result: 成功将雷达信号处理复杂度从O(B²T²)显著降低到O(BT log T)，并能够定义具有低峰均功率比的最优雷达波形库。

Conclusion: 基于离散海森堡-外尔群和辛变换的Zak-OTFS雷达感知方法提供了高效的波形设计和低复杂度信号处理方案，为雷达系统性能优化提供了新途径。

Abstract: Zak-OTFS is modulation scheme where signals are formed in the delay-Doppler
(DD) domain, converted to the time domain (DD) for transmission and reception,
then returned to the DD domain for processing. We describe how to use the same
architecture for radar sensing. The intended delay resolution is $\frac{1}{B}$
where $B$ is the radar bandwidth, and the intended Doppler resolution is
$\frac{1}{T}$ where $T$ is the transmission time. We form a radar waveform in
the DD domain, illuminate the scattering environment, match filter the return,
then correlate with delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. This
produces an image of the scattering environment, and the radar ambiguity
function expresses the blurriness of this image. The possible delay and Doppler
shifts generate the continuous Heisenberg-Weyl group which has been widely
studied in the theory of radar. We describe how to approach the problem of
waveform design, not from the perspective of this continuous group, but from
the perspective of a discrete group of delay and Doppler shifts, where the
discretization is determined by the intended delay and Doppler resolution of
the radar. We describe how to approach the problem of shaping the ambiguity
surface through symplectic transformations that normalize our discrete
Heisenberg-Weyl group. The complexity of traditional continuous radar signal
processing is $\mathcal{O}\big(B^2T^2\big)$. We describe how to reduce this
complexity to $\mathcal{O}\big(BT\log T\big)$ by choosing the radar waveform to
be a common eigenvector of a maximal commutative subgroup of our discrete
Heisenberg-Weyl group. The theory of symplectic transformations also enables
defining libraries of optimal radar waveforms with small peak-to-average power
ratios.

Abstract: The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is revolutionizing industrial
processes by facilitating massive machine-type communications among countless
interconnected devices. To efficiently handle the resulting large-scale and
sporadic traffic, grant-free random access protocols-especially coded random
access (CRA)-have emerged as scalable and reliable solutions. At the same time,
advancements in wireless hardware, including extremely large-scale MIMO arrays
and high-frequency communication (e.g., mmWave, Terahertz), are pushing network
operations into the near-field propagation regime, allowing for dense
connectivity and enhanced spatial multiplexing. This paper proposes an
innovative approach that combines near-field spatial multiplexing with the
interference mitigation capabilities of CRA, utilizing an extremely large
aperture array at the access point. This integration improves reliability and
reduces access latency, offering a robust framework for IIoT connectivity in
next-generation 6G networks.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究分析了示波法血压测量的系统误差来源，提出基于最小二乘和最大似然估计的校正框架，通过多测量统计先验提高非侵入性血压监测精度。

Method: 使用MIMIC数据库的血压波形数据，提出估计理论框架，采用最小二乘(LS)和最大似然(ML)方法校正单次和重复血压测量。LS支持传统多测量平均协议，ML方法整合测量误差的先验知识。

Result: 示波法倾向于低估收缩压和高估舒张压，呼吸引入周期性变化进一步降低测量精度。利用多读数统计先验可显著提高非侵入性血压监测的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的统计估计框架能有效校正示波法血压测量误差，对改善心血管疾病诊断和治疗具有潜在应用价值，ML方法因整合先验知识而表现更优。

Abstract: Oscillometry is the standard method for non-invasive, cuff-based blood
pressure (BP) measurement, but it introduces systematic errors that may impact
clinical accuracy. This study investigates the sources of these
errors--primarily the limitations of oscillometry itself and
respiration-induced fluctuations--using BP waveform data from the MIMIC
database. Oscillometry tends to underestimate systolic BP and overestimate
diastolic BP, while respiration introduces cyclical variations that further
degrade measurement precision. To mitigate these effects, we propose an
estimation-theoretic framework employing least squares (LS) and maximum
likelihood (ML) methods for correcting both single and repeated BP
measurements. LS estimation supports conventional multi-measurement averaging
protocols, whereas the ML approach incorporates prior knowledge of measurement
errors, offering improved performance. Our results demonstrate that leveraging
statistical priors across multiple readings can enhance the accuracy of
non-invasive BP monitoring, with potential implications for improving
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于患者群体和临床环境的差异性，没有单一模型能在所有群体中都表现最佳，需要个性化的风险预测方案

Method: 两阶段流程：首先使用FAISS相似性搜索在9个多样化实际群体中识别最相关患者群体，然后用LLM根据群体性能指标推荐最佳预测算法（包括线性风险模型、时间敏感模型、多模态计算机视觉方法）

Result: 构建了支持灵活、群体驱动的模型选择机制，能够在多样化临床群体中实现个体化风险评估

Conclusion: 该两阶段代理系统为实际肺癌筛查中的个体化风险评估提供了实用路径，通过动态模型选择适应不同患者群体的差异性

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

Conclusion: HHNAS-AM方法通过分层组织和自适应变异策略，有效解决了NAS在文本分类中的搜索空间问题，显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

### [16] [Twin-Boot: Uncertainty-Aware Optimization via Online Two-Sample Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15019)
*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot) 是一种集成不确定性估计的优化方法，通过并行训练两个模型并使用周期性均值重置来保持轨迹在同一优化盆地，从而提供局部不确定性估计和正则化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度下降方法只能提供点估计而无法给出置信度度量，这在过参数化和数据稀缺的情况下尤其成问题。标准的bootstrap方法在深度学习应用中不实用，需要训练多个副本且无法指导学习过程。

Method: 训练两个相同的模型在独立的bootstrap样本上并行训练，通过周期性均值重置保持两个轨迹在同一优化盆地，利用它们的差异来估计局部不确定性，并使用这种估计进行自适应权重采样以实现正则化。

Result: 在深度神经网络和复杂高维逆问题中，该方法提高了校准性和泛化能力，并产生了可解释的不确定性图。

Conclusion: Twin-Boot成功地将不确定性估计集成到优化过程中，解决了传统bootstrap方法在深度学习中的局限性，为过参数化模型提供了有效的正则化和不确定性量化手段。

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LPO提出了三项关键创新：梯度解耦、偏移约束稳定化、可控拒绝压制，解决DPO过拟合和崩溃问题，在多种任务上实现更好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO算法虽简单稳定但容易过拟合和崩溃，需要改进偏好优化框架的稳定性和可控性。

Method: 使用绝对差值损失替代log-sigmoid函数实现梯度解耦，通过偏移约束和正则化项保持响应质量，采用梯度分离和可调系数线性控制拒绝概率。

Result: 在普通文本任务、数学任务和文本转语音任务上均实现了性能提升，证明LPO作为一种健壮可调的偏好对齐方法。

Conclusion: LPO通过线性偏好优化框架有效解决了DPO的限制，提供了更稳定和可控的对齐方案，并开源了源码、模型和训练数据。

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

TL;DR: 本文研究了异构腐败率下的鲁棒估计问题，针对不同样本具有不同已知腐败概率的情况，给出了多元有界分布和单变量高斯分布均值估计的紧致极小极大率，并为多元高斯均值估计和线性回归建立了平方误差的极小极大率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式学习、众包和传感器网络等应用中，样本可能以不同但已知的概率被独立腐败，而现有鲁棒估计方法通常假设均匀或最坏情况腐败，忽略了结构性异构。

Method: 通过理论分析建立异构腐败模式下的极小极大率框架，研究最优估计器的性能界限和样本选择策略。

Result: 发现最优估计器会丢弃超过特定腐败阈值的样本，该阈值由给定腐败率的经验分布决定，获得了多元有界分布和单变量高斯分布的紧致极小极大率，以及多元高斯和线性回归的近似极小极大率。

Conclusion: 异构腐败率设置下的鲁棒估计具有独特的理论特性，样本选择阈值策略在最优估计中起关键作用，为实际应用中的异构腐败问题提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

TL;DR: LFM4Ads是一个全表示多粒度迁移框架，通过全面迁移用户表示、物品表示和交叉表示，并使用多粒度机制提升迁移效果，在腾讯广告平台实现了显著的GMV提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅迁移用户表示，忽略了物品表示和用户-物品交叉表示的价值，且简单的特征级迁移无法弥合上下游差距和充分利用多种迁移粒度。

Method: 提出LFM4Ads框架：1）全面迁移三种表示；2）识别最佳提取层并聚合交叉表示；3）使用非线性适配器（特征级）、同构交互模块（模块级）和独立检索（模型级）的多粒度迁移机制。

Result: 在腾讯工业级广告平台成功部署，处理每日数百亿样本，保持TB级模型参数和数十亿稀疏嵌入键。自2024年Q4上线以来，在微信朋友圈和视频号等主要广告场景实现10+次成功上线，整体平台GMV提升2.45%，预计年收入增加数亿美元。

Conclusion: LFM4Ads通过全表示迁移和多粒度机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在工业级广告推荐中取得了显著的业务效果和经济效益。

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了NGN-M算法，结合动量和NGN步长调整方法，在保持独特性能的同时提高了对步长超参数的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代优化算法对超参数选择敏感，调参困难耗时，需要提高算法在不同超参数下的稳定性。

Method: 提出NGN-M算法，将动量机制与NGN步长调整方法相结合，在更宽松的假设条件下达到标准收敛速率。

Result: 算法在保持与最先进优化器相当性能的同时，显著提高了对步长超参数选择的稳健性。

Conclusion: NGN-M算法为深度学习优化提供了更稳定的解决方案，减少了超参数调整的负担。

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

Motivation: 量子机器学习中设计有效的变分量子电路(VQC)具有挑战性且通常需要针对特定任务，需要一种能够自动优化电路架构的方法

Method: 开发了DiffQAS-QLSTM框架，这是一个端到端可微分框架，在训练过程中同时优化VQC参数和架构选择

Result: DiffQAS-QLSTM在多样化测试设置中始终优于手工设计的基线模型，实现了更低的损失

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展和自适应的量子序列学习开辟了新途径

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to
quantum machine learning (QML), with growing interest in learning from
sequential data. Quantum recurrent models like QLSTM are promising for
time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing
effective variational quantum circuits (VQCs) remains challenging and often
task-specific. To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end
differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture
selection during training. Our results show that DiffQAS-QLSTM consistently
outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test
settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum
sequence learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hydra是一个混合长上下文语言模型架构，结合了条件计算、长上下文记忆机制和稀疏专家混合，在约16亿参数设计范围内整合了Mamba风格SSM骨干、间歇性稀疏全局注意力、分块级MoE前馈路由和双记忆系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决长上下文语言模型在处理长序列时的计算效率和内存利用问题，通过模块化设计结合多种高效技术，实现输入自适应的长上下文处理能力。

Method: 采用Mamba风格结构化状态空间模型(SSM)作为骨干，结合间歇性稀疏全局注意力机制、分块级稀疏专家混合(MoE)前馈路由，以及工作记忆加事实PKM的双记忆系统。

Result: 通过小规模原型验证了实现可行性，展示了长上下文吞吐量交叉和可控专家路由等定性扩展行为，但尚未进行大规模竞争性性能验证。

Conclusion: Hydra提供了一个蓝图框架，结合了SSM效率、选择性稀疏注意力、MoE容量和可学习记忆，为模块化、输入自适应的长上下文语言模型指明了发展方向，但最终任务性能验证仍需未来工作。

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

TL;DR: CuMoLoS-MAE是一种基于课程学习和蒙特卡洛随机集成掩码自编码器的新方法，用于修复大气遥感数据中的噪声和缺失，同时提供像素级不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大气遥感数据修复方法会模糊精细结构特征，而现有深度学习模型缺乏置信度估计，需要一种既能恢复精细特征又能提供不确定性量化的解决方案。

Method: 采用课程引导的掩码比例训练策略，通过蒙特卡洛随机掩码集成方法，使用ViT解码器从稀疏上下文中重建大气场，并多次评估以获取后验预测均值和像素级不确定性图。

Result: 该方法能够恢复上升/下沉气流核心、切变线和小涡旋等精细尺度特征，学习数据驱动的大气场先验，并提供像素级不确定性量化。

Conclusion: CuMoLoS-MAE不仅实现高保真重建，还支持增强的对流诊断、实时数据同化和改进的长期气候再分析，为大气遥感数据处理提供了新的深度学习工作流程。

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

Motivation: 传统自监督对比学习方法只能生成成对的增强视图，无法充分利用ECG记录的丰富时间结构，限制了模型性能。

Method: 多窗口对比学习框架，从每个ECG实例提取多个时间窗口构建正样本对，通过统计方法最大化它们的一致性，并借鉴慢特征分析原理学习时间不变性特征。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集的多标签超类分类中，AUROC达到0.891（vs 0.888），F1分数0.680（vs 0.679），预训练epoch减少4倍（32 vs 128），总预训练时间减少14.8%。

Conclusion: 多窗口对比学习为ECG分析提供了一种高效可扩展的自监督学习范式，也为生物医学时间序列数据的表示学习提供了有前景的通用框架。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

demonstrated a 92% human success rate and a 10% bot bypass rate, significantly
outperforming existing CAPTCHA systems. The system provided a robust and

Motivation: 解释之前使用D-Wave采样时RBM训练效果不明显的原因，并探索如何利用量子与经典采样方法的差异来改善机器学习性能。

Method: 提出了一种新的混合采样方法，结合了经典MCMC和D-Wave量子逆灰器的采样能力，并在RBM训练和恐怖忘却减轻场景下进行实验。

Result: 混合采样方法在RBM训练中未实现显著改善，但首次证明了量子采样在生成大量特异模式以减轻恐怖忘却方面的可行性，效果与经典方法相当。

Conclusion: 量子逆灰器与经典采样在分布低概率区域的差异不足以改善RBM训练，但在生成多样化样本和应对恐怖忘却等机器学习挑战中具有潜力。

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合静态编译器分析和蒙特卡洛树搜索的系统，用于自动化大型机器学习模型的分区优化，解决了现有方法内存不足、速度慢和次优解的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有自动分区器在处理大型机器学习模型时经常出现内存不足错误或搜索速度过慢，而且由于人为限制搜索空间，往往产生不可行的解决方案或次优性能。

Method: 结合新颖的静态编译器分析和蒙特卡洛树搜索：静态分析识别需要相同分区的张量维度和需要解决的分区冲突，构建高效的决策空间；蒙特卡洛树搜索在优化后的空间中进行智能探索。

Result: 系统在多样化硬件平台和模型架构上显著优于最先进的工业方法，发现了以前未知的优越解决方案，并且即使对于复杂大型模型也能实现完全自动化。

Conclusion: 该方法通过智能的空间优化和搜索策略，有效解决了大型机器学习模型分布式分区中的内存约束和性能优化问题，实现了高效自动化的分区解决方案。

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

TL;DR: SEAL是一种可解释的图神经网络，通过将分子分解为化学相关片段并量化其对预测的因果影响，解决了GNN黑盒问题，在定量指标和人类可解释性方面均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在分子性质预测中表现出色，但其黑盒特性降低了可解释性，限制了在药物发现等重要应用中的可信度。现有解释技术往往无法可靠量化原子或子结构的贡献。

Method: SEAL将输入图分解为化学相关片段，通过减少片段间消息传递的模型架构，估计片段对输出的因果影响，实现片段贡献与模型预测的强对齐。

Result: 在合成基准和真实分子数据集上的广泛评估表明，SEAL在定量归因指标和人类对齐可解释性方面均优于其他可解释性方法。用户研究证实SEAL为领域专家提供了更直观可信的解释。

Conclusion: SEAL通过弥合预测性能和可解释性之间的差距，为更透明和可操作的分子建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

Motivation: 随着深度神经网络和数据集规模的增大，训练计算成本显著增加。传统的层冻结方法虽然能减少训练成本，但冻结层仍需前向传播生成特征图，限制了计算成本的进一步降低。现有缓存特征图的方法存在增强应用困难和存储开销大的问题，需要系统性的解决方案。

Result: 该方法在保持模型精度的同时显著降低了训练成本，仅带来较小的时间开销；通过全面评估冻结和压缩策略，为高效DNN训练提供了优化见解。

Conclusion: 本文首次全面探索了层冻结缓存方法中的关键挑战，并提供了系统性解决方案，通过创新的增强和压缩技术实现了训练成本的有效降低，为大规模神经网络训练提供了实用的效率优化方法。

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

Motivation: 研究深度神经网络中"愚弄样本"现象，即DNN对看似随机的输入产生高置信度分类，旨在理解DNN在过参数化状态下的泛化行为机制。

Method: 采用基于最大似然估计的分析框架，避免依赖传统的基于梯度的优化方法和显式标签，通过理论分析探索DNN的学习动态。

Result: 发现过参数化DNN会出现输出特征空间坍缩，虽然改善泛化但最终导致退化状态；提出的"虫洞"解决方案能绕过退化，协调随机输入与有意义标签的关系。

Conclusion: 研究为理解DNN泛化机制提供了新见解，揭示了短路学习的新视角，并为无监督学习动态的未来研究指明了方向，有助于弥合理论与实践的差距。

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估稀疏自编码器(SAE)在减少神经元多义性方面的效果，提出了基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念可分离性评分，并开发了新的干预方法APP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中的神经元多义性（一个神经元对多个不相关概念响应）阻碍了模型可解释性。虽然稀疏自编码器被提出用于缓解此问题，但缺乏与基础模型的定量比较。

Method: 使用Gemma-2-2B模型和多种SAE变体，在五个基准测试上评估概念可分离性。提出了基于Jensen-Shannon距离的细粒度概念分离评分，并开发了两种干预策略：全神经元掩码和部分抑制。

Result: SAE确实减少了多义性并获得了更高的概念可分离性，但更大的稀疏性并不总是带来更好的分离性，且经常损害下游性能。SAE在使用部分抑制时能实现更精确的概念级控制。

Conclusion: 提出的APP干预方法在目标概念移除方面优于现有方法，为基于概念的可控干预提供了新途径，但需要在稀疏性和性能之间找到平衡。

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

Motivation: 随着文本到图像生成模型在隐私、版权和安全方面的担忧日益增加，概念擦除技术(CETs)被开发用于阻止生成特定不良概念。然而这些技术的实际效果和鲁棒性需要系统评估。

Method: 提出了Side Effect Evaluation (SEE)评估基准，包含分层和组合提示词的数据集，通过自动化评估流程从三个维度量化CETs的副作用：对邻近概念的影响、目标规避和属性泄漏。

Result: 实验发现CETs可以通过超类-子类层级结构和语义相似提示词(如目标的组合变体)轻松绕过，同时存在属性泄漏和注意力集中/分散的反直觉现象。

Conclusion: 当前的概念擦除技术存在严重的安全漏洞和副作用，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。作者发布了数据集、代码和评估工具以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了源代码免访问情况下的去学习挑战，为机器学习模型的数据私隐和版权问题提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习框架缺乏统一的数学理论基础，无法很好地处理异步分布式计算场景。作者希望通过范畴论和余代数等高级数学工具，为RL建立一个更通用、更形式化的理论基础，特别是为了适应并行分布式环境中的计算需求。

Result: 建立了通用强化学习(URL)的理论框架，将传统RL问题统一到范畴论和余代数的数学基础之上，特别是为异步并行分布式RL计算提供了形式化的理论基础。

Conclusion: 范畴论和余代数理论为强化学习提供了强大而统一的数学基础，URL框架不仅能够涵盖传统RL模型，还能自然扩展到异步分布式计算环境，为未来RL理论发展和算法设计提供了新的方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

Motivation: 越狱攻击通过制作对抗性提示绕过LLM的对齐机制，导致模型产生有害内容，严重威胁大语言模型的安全性。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 动态有害输出检测（外部分类器+模型内部评估）；2) 通过FFN激活进行token级有害内容追踪；3) 约束优化抑制不安全行为而不降低模型质量

Conclusion: 遗忘学习是构建可扩展且有效的LLM安全性的有前景方向，SafeLLM实现了精确控制和不可逆遗忘

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness

*Jizu Huang,Rukang You,Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对张量神经网络在高维多尺度问题中难以捕捉高频特征的问题，提出了结合随机傅里叶特征和频率自适应策略的新算法，有效提升了模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统张量神经网络受频率原理限制，难以准确捕捉高维多尺度问题中的高频特征，需要新的方法来增强其表达能力。

Method: 通过傅里叶分析训练动态，结合随机傅里叶特征，利用张量结构对一维分量函数进行离散傅里叶变换来提取高维函数频率特征，提出频率自适应TNN算法。

Result: 大量数值实验验证了所提频率自适应TNN算法的有效性和鲁棒性，显著提升了解决复杂多尺度问题的能力。

Conclusion: 基于张量结构和傅里叶分析的方法有效缓解了维度灾难，显著增强了TNN在高维多尺度问题中的表现能力。

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

Method: 开发多变量差分变换器(SleepDIFFormer)架构，处理EEG和EOG时间序列信号，采用跨域对齐训练，通过特征分布对齐学习领域不变的联合表示，减少时空注意力噪声。

Result: 在五个不同睡眠分期数据集上评估，相比现有方法达到最先进性能，并通过消融分析和注意力权重解释验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SleepDIFFormer方法显著提升了睡眠分期分类的自动化水平和泛化能力，对睡眠质量评估应用有重要价值，代码已开源。

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code
is publicly available at https://github.com/Ben1001409/SleepDIFFormer

TL;DR: 提出了多归因学习框架MAL，通过整合多种归因机制信号来改进CVR预测，相比传统单一归因方法显著提升效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CVR预测方法只使用单一归因机制标签，浪费了其他归因视角的互补信号，限制了模型性能

Method: MAL框架包含两个核心组件：归因知识聚合器(AKA)和主目标预测器(PTP)，采用多任务学习和笛卡尔积训练策略整合多种归因标签

Result: 离线实验GAUC提升0.51%，在线实验ROI提升2.6%

Conclusion: 多归因学习框架能够有效整合不同归因机制信号，显著提升CVR预测性能和商业效果

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

### [45] [Locally Pareto-Optimal Interpretations for Black-Box Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15220)
*Aniruddha Joshi,Supratik Chakraborty,S Akshay,Shetal Shah,Hazem Torfah,Sanjit Seshia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于局部最优性保证的框架，用于更可扩展地合成黑盒机器学习模型的解释，在准确性和可解释性之间寻找希望置代解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多目标解释合成技术缺乏对希望置代最优性的形式保证，而能提供这种保证的方法又面临严重的可扩展性问题。

Method: 首先使用多目标学习或搜索技术（如多目标蒙特卡罗树搜索）生成希望置代最优候选集，然后通过SAT求解器验证每个候选解的局部最优性。

Result: 在一组基准测试中，该方法生成的解释与提供全局保证的方法类似，但具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过局部最优性保证的框架，可以在保持高质量解释的同时解决可扩展性问题，为黑盒模型提供可信过的解释。

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自一致性多数投票方法存在精度收益递减和计算开销大的问题，需要更高效的测试时推理方法

Method: 利用模型内部置信度信号在生成过程中或生成后动态过滤低质量推理轨迹，无需额外训练或超参数调优

Result: 在AIME 2025等挑战性基准测试中达到99.9%准确率，相比全并行思考减少84.7%的生成token

Conclusion: DeepConf是一种简单而强大的方法，可无缝集成到现有服务框架中，显著提升推理效率和性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting.
However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think
with Confidence (DeepConf), a simple yet powerful method that enhances both
reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full
parallel thinking.

### [47] [Evaluating Knowledge Graph Complexity via Semantic, Spectral, and Structural Metrics for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15291)
*Haji Gul,Abul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文批判性评估了CSG指标在知识图谱链接预测中的有效性，发现其对参数敏感且与性能指标相关性弱，提出了更可靠的结构和语义复杂度指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解数据集复杂度对于评估知识图谱链接预测模型至关重要，但现有的CSG指标尚未在KG环境中得到验证，需要系统评估其在多关系链接预测中的有效性。

Method: 在知识图谱链接预测背景下评估CSG指标，引入transformer嵌入的语义表示，并提出并基准测试一组结构和语义KG复杂度指标，包括关系熵、最大关系多样性等。

Result: CSG对参数高度敏感，不能稳健地随类别数量扩展，与MRR和Hit@1的相关性弱或不一致。关系熵、最大关系多样性等指标与性能指标呈现强负相关，而图连通性指标与Hit@10正相关。

Conclusion: CSG在链接预测环境中缺乏稳定性和泛化预测能力，需要开发更稳定、可解释且与任务对齐的数据集复杂度度量方法。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

TL;DR: PL-Reg是一种新的部分逻辑正则化方法，通过为未定义逻辑公式预留空间来提升模型对未知类的适应性，相比现有方法在泛化性能上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理未知类时存在局限性：类发现范式偏向已知类，增量学习存在灾难性遗忘问题，而L-Reg等方法需要完全定义的逻辑公式，缺乏灵活性。

Result: 在广义类别发现、多域广义类别发现和长尾类增量学习任务上的大量实验表明，PL-Reg带来了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 部分逻辑在解决未知类相关挑战方面具有有效性，PL-Reg为处理现实应用中未知类问题提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Motivation: 传统人物角色分类方法在捕捉上下文信息方面存在不足，特别是在整合文本和表格数据方面，且缺乏可解释性，使得预测结果难以解释或证明。

Method: 提出ExBigBang混合方法，使用transformer架构建模丰富的上下文特征，通过用户画像和分类的循环过程动态更新以反映用户行为变化。

Result: 在基准人物角色分类数据集上的实验证明了模型的鲁棒性，消融研究确认了结合文本和表格数据的好处，可解释AI技术揭示了模型预测背后的原理。

Conclusion: ExBigBang通过整合多模态数据和可解释技术，为人物角色分类提供了更上下文化和可解释的解决方案，能够更好地捕捉真实用户需求。

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型经常保留训练数据中的偏见，导致对少数群体的不公平待遇。现有企业端偏见缓解技术通常需要承担效用成本和组织支持，而许多模型依赖用户贡献数据，因此用户端可以采取行动

Method: 提出三种实用的、模型无关的方法来近似理想重新标记，通过算法集体行动框架，协调的少数群体战略性重新标记自身数据

Result: 在真实数据集上验证显示，少数群体的一个子群可以显著减少不公平性，同时对整体预测误差的影响很小

Conclusion: 用户端通过协调重新标记数据是提升模型公平性的有效方法，无需企业端干预，且能保持模型效用

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图嵌入方法存在两个关键但未被充分探索的问题：结构访问偏差（随机游走采样过度强调高节点导致冗余噪声）和突变演化盲点（无法有效检测突然结构变化），需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出EvoFormer框架，包含：1）结构感知Transformer模块，通过基于节点结构角色的位置编码全局区分节点结构；2）演化敏感时间模块，采用三步策略：随机游走时间戳分类、图级时间分割、段感知时间自注意力结合边演化预测任务。

Conclusion: EvoFormer通过纠正结构和时间偏差，有效解决了动态图表示学习中的关键挑战，验证了其在捕捉结构演化趋势方面的有效性。

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across
diverse modeling paradigms.

Method: 基于PyTorch实现的演化模糊系统，在联邦学习框架下进行局部模型训练，仅共享模型参数而不共享原始数据，通过重叠条件计算来处理新聚类

Result: 在聚类和分类任务上测试显示，该方法在多个知名UCI数据集上的性能优于已有的分类方法

Conclusion: 虽然计算强度较大（由于重叠条件计算），但该方法在去中心化数据处理方面展现出显著优势，特别适合联邦学习环境

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI
datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition
calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in
decentralized data processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepONet输出相对于分支网络最后一层参数是线性的，这些参数可以用最小二乘法优化，但直接构建完整的LS系统会导致计算不可行的大型线性问题

Method: 将大型LS系统分解为分支网络和主干网络两个更小的子问题分别求解，并推广到带有正则化项的L2损失函数，包括物理信息无监督学习的情况

Result: 该方法能够有效处理原本计算不可行的大型线性系统，提高了DeepONet的训练效率

Conclusion: 提出的混合优化方法成功解决了DeepONet训练中的计算瓶颈问题，为高效训练提供了可行方案

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多元高斯聚类重叠检测方法，专门针对数据流在线学习场景，能够快速检测重叠聚类并避免正交聚类合并


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线数据流学习中，聚类模型需要适应概念漂移，可能产生大量重叠聚类需要合并。现有分布差异度量方法无法有效处理所有形状的聚类且计算成本高

Method: 设计了一种专门检测重叠而非差异的相异度度量方法，计算速度比现有方法快数倍

Result: 该方法比对比方法快数倍，能够有效检测重叠聚类，同时避免正交聚类的错误合并

Conclusion: 提出的重叠检测方法为在线数据流学习中的聚类合并提供了高效实用的解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

Conclusion: MRP方法通过不可逆投影变换从根本上解决了机器遗忘中信息痕迹残留的问题，为模型安全提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

Motivation: 现有神经网络局部鲁棒性验证器分析时间长或精度损失大，难以有效处理大规模输入集

Method: 提出分组局部鲁棒性验证，利用ε-ball的网络计算相似性，动态构建小批量进行联合验证，自适应识别成功的小批量大小

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10的全连接和卷积网络上，BaVerLy平均提升验证效率2.3倍，最高达4.1倍，将24小时分析时间减少到6小时

Conclusion: BaVerLy通过小批量验证方法有效解决了局部鲁棒性验证的效率问题，为大规模神经网络安全验证提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

TL;DR: HypSeek是一个双曲表示学习框架，将配体、蛋白质口袋和序列嵌入到Lorentz模型双曲空间中，统一了虚拟筛选和亲和力排名任务，在DUD-E和JACS数据集上分别提升了20.7%和25.4%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于检索的方法在欧几里得空间中嵌入配体和蛋白质口袋，但欧几里得几何无法有效捕捉分子相互作用的层次结构和细粒度亲和力变化，特别是在活性悬崖等挑战性案例中。

Method: 提出HypSeek框架，利用双曲空间的指数几何和负曲率特性，采用蛋白质引导的三塔架构，在Lorentz模型双曲空间中生成表达力强、对亲和力敏感的嵌入表示。

Result: 在DUD-E虚拟筛选中早期富集从42.63提升到51.44（+20.7%），在JACS亲和力排名中相关性从0.5774提升到0.7239（+25.4%）。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为蛋白质-配体建模提供了强大的归纳偏置，能够有效建模全局活性和细微功能差异，在虚拟筛选和亲和力排名任务中都显示出显著优势。

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

Conclusion: FairGuide通过结构引导有效提升了图神经网络的公平性，为图数据公平性研究提供了新思路

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

TL;DR: SPOF是一种用于多用户本地差分隐私的稳定扰动损失函数训练机制，通过扰动泰勒展开多项式逼近的损失函数系数来实现隐私保护，相比DP-SGD在计算效率和稳定性方面有显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多用户本地差分隐私场景下梯度注入噪声方法（如DP-SGD）存在的计算效率低和稳定性差的问题，需要开发一种更高效稳定的隐私保护训练机制

Method: SPOF通过稳定化泰勒展开多项式逼近模型的训练损失函数，对多项式系数添加校准噪声来实现数据私有化，避免了直接向梯度注入噪声

Result: 在无线体域网场景下，SPOF相比DP-SGD平均重建准确率提升3.5%，平均训练时间减少57.2%，表现出更好的隐私-效用权衡

Conclusion: SPOF机制在多用户本地差分隐私环境中具有显著优势，提供了更好的计算效率、稳定性和鲁棒性，特别适合存在环境噪声的分布式学习场景

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

Motivation: 解决模拟基于推断(SBI)中的模型错设问题，并充分利用检验数据和未配对样本来提高推断的准确性。

Method: 使用小批量最优运输和条件正规化流来对齐实际和模拟观测数据，建立一个端到端可训练的模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了模型错设问题，提供了更可扩展的归纳性推断方案，在具有挑战性的环境中体现了优秀的性能。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

Conclusion: CoNTM成功填补了持续学习在主题建模领域的空白，提供了既具有长期记忆又能在线学习新主题的有效解决方案。

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

Conclusion: GRASPED通过频域编码和解码设计，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为无监督图异常检测提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

Motivation: 当前的机器学习公平性方法缺乏形式保证，而依靠验证的方法既不能主动提升公平性，又可能无法得出结论。需要一种能够在训练过程中主动维护并保证个体公平性的方法。

Method: 该方法包含两部分：(1) 可证公平的初始化，确保模型在公平状态下开始；(2) 公平保持训练算法，在模型学习过程中维持公平性。关键技术是使用随机响应机制来保护敏感属性同时维持公平保证。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种能够形式保证个体公平性在整个训练过程中维持的新框架，充分结合了公平保证和训练效果，为机器学习公平性领域提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

TL;DR: 提出了PECANN框架的多项改进：广义化ALM支持多惩罚参数、约束项期望化减少内存开销、傅里叶特征映射处理多尺度特征、时间窗口策略确保连续性，以及条件自适应惩罚更新策略CAPU增强约束执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升物理和等式约束神经网络(PECANN)框架的能力，以更好地学习典型偏微分方程的解，特别是在处理异构约束、多尺度特征和长时间演化等挑战性问题时。

Method: 1) 广义化增广拉格朗日法支持多惩罚参数；2) 将点约束和拉格朗日乘子重构为期望形式；3) 引入傅里叶特征映射；4) 时间窗口策略确保连续性；5) 条件自适应惩罚更新策略CAPU。

Conclusion: 这些改进显著提升了PECANN框架的鲁棒性、效率和适用性，使其能够更好地应对科学计算中的苛刻问题。

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseLoCo是一种通信高效的LLM训练算法，通过Top-k稀疏化和2位量化实现高达1-3%的压缩比，在通信受限环境下超越全精度DiLoCo的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练算法在带宽受限环境下仍存在通信瓶颈，即使减少通信频率也需要传输完整梯度，且性能略逊于标准AdamW DDP基准。量化方法在LLM预训练中稀疏化应用有限。

Method: 结合Top-k稀疏化和量化技术，利用外部动量的局部近似和误差反馈，通过稀疏聚合提升模型性能，实现极端压缩。

Result: 在多种通信受限的LLM训练场景中，SparseLoCo在性能和通信成本方面均显示出显著优势，压缩比达到1-3%稀疏度和2位量化。

Conclusion: SparseLoCo成功解决了LLM分布式训练中的通信瓶颈问题，通过创新的稀疏化和量化方法实现了高性能和极低通信成本的平衡。

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

Motivation: 尽管似然理论上是最优的OOD检测器，但实践中经常失败，需要研究这是密度估计能力问题还是像素空间表示问题

Method: 在预训练ResNet-18的表示空间上训练变分扩散模型，使用似然作为OOD分数，与OpenOOD套件中的最先进方法进行比较

Result: 论文通过实验评估了表示空间中基于似然的OOD检测性能，但具体结果未在摘要中明确说明

Conclusion: 研究旨在验证表示空间是否比像素空间更适合基于似然的OOD检测，为解决实践中似然检测失败问题提供新视角

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing

Result: 在多种多智能体PettingZoo基准测试中，针对不同最先进攻击方法进行评估，该方法能有效检测有影响的对抗攻击，在所有评估环境中对最具影响力攻击的AUC-ROC分数超过0.95，优于离散对应方法。

Conclusion: 提出的去中心化检测器在连续动作空间的多智能体强化学习系统中表现出色，能够有效实时检测对抗攻击，为多智能体系统的安全性提供了可靠保障。

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical

capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to

outperforming Mathematica in various cases.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel kernel-based formulation of the Equalized Odds
(EO) criterion, denoted as $EO_k$, for fair representation learning (FRL) in
supervised settings. The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination
regarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for
the target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and
interpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence
(prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as
equalized odds; prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on
target attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned
on the prediction $\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$)
and biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both
independence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive
accuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter,
thereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among
these fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart,
$\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time,
with linear-time approximations also available. A concentration inequality for
$\hat{EO}_k$ is derived, providing performance guarantees and error bounds,
which serve as practical certificates of fairness compliance. While our focus
is on theoretical development, the results lay essential groundwork for
principled and provably fair algorithmic design in future empirical studies.

Motivation: 当前在从有限数据学习动态系统模型时，如何融合不同的先验知识（如部分已知系统方程和未知模型部分的平滑性假设）与数据信息仍然是一个挑战，特别是在具有潜在系统状态的输入-输出设置中。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的接口，将已知动态函数与基于学习的未知系统部分近似相结合。基于提出的模型结构，推导了用于高效参数边缘化的闭式密度。

Conclusion: 所设计的框架具有广泛适用性，在三个不同的案例研究中得到验证，包括一个实验数据集，证明了其作为推理和学习通用工具的有效性。

Abstract: Accuracy and generalization capabilities are key objectives when learning
dynamical system models. To obtain such models from limited data, current works
exploit prior knowledge and assumptions about the system. However, the fusion
of diverse prior knowledge, e. g. partially known system equations and
smoothness assumptions about unknown model parts, with information contained in
the data remains a challenging problem, especially in input-output settings
with latent system state. In particular, learning functions that are nested
inside known system equations can be a laborious and error-prone expert task.
This paper considers inference of latent states and learning of unknown model
parts for fusion of data information with different sources of prior knowledge.
The main contribution is a general-purpose system identification tool that, for
the first time, provides a consistent solution for both, online and offline
Bayesian inference and learning while allowing to incorporate explicit and
implicit prior system knowledge. We propose a novel interface for combining
known dynamics functions with a learning-based approximation of unknown system
parts. Based on the proposed model structure, closed-form densities for
efficient parameter marginalization are derived. No user-tailored coordinate
transformations or model inversions are needed, making the presented framework
a general-purpose tool for inference and learning. The broad applicability of
the devised framework is illustrated in three distinct case studies, including
an experimental data set.

Motivation: 预期改善（EI）是贝叶斯优化中应用最广法的获取函数，但其累积悔弃上界理论一直是开放问题，需要理论支撑

Method: 分析噪音GP-EI算法，考虑三种常用的当前最佳值选择（BPMI、BSPMI、BOI），提供累积悔弃上界理论证明

Conclusion: 研究为实践者在噪音环境中应用GP-EI提供了理论指导，数值实验验证了理论结果

Abstract: Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition
functions in Bayesian optimization (BO). Despite its proven empirical success
in applications, the cumulative regret upper bound of EI remains an open
question. In this paper, we analyze the classic noisy Gaussian process expected
improvement (GP-EI) algorithm. We consider the Bayesian setting, where the
objective is a sample from a GP. Three commonly used incumbents, namely the
best posterior mean incumbent (BPMI), the best sampled posterior mean incumbent
(BSPMI), and the best observation incumbent (BOI) are considered as the choices
of the current best value in GP-EI. We present for the first time the
cumulative regret upper bounds of GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI. Importantly, we
show that in both cases, GP-EI is a no-regret algorithm for both squared
exponential (SE) and Mat\'ern kernels. Further, we present for the first time
that GP-EI with BOI either achieves a sublinear cumulative regret upper bound
or has a fast converging noisy simple regret bound for SE and Mat\'ern kernels.
Our results provide theoretical guidance to the choice of incumbent when
practitioners apply GP-EI in the noisy setting. Numerical experiments are
conducted to validate our findings.

Abstract: Modeling feature interactions in tabular data remains a key challenge in
predictive modeling, for example, as used for insurance pricing. This paper
proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly captures pairwise feature interactions
through a shared feed-forward neural network architecture that mimics the
structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design,
allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for
efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only
involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and
established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural
networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show
that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in
predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact
with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.
