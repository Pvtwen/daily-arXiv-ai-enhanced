However, how to\nintelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a\nstructure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a\ntwo-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction\nvalues of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods\nare designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced\ndeep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an\nimproved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full\neigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is\nachieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.\nFurthermore, we derive the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under\nmultiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation\nresults show that the developed three methods achieve 100\\% number of targets\nsensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior\nunder extremely-low SNR conditions.

The ability to predict the future structural\nevolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable\ninsights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle\nchanges of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute\nchallenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,\nwe propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative\nautoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by\nautoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a\nconvenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future\nscan.

This paper proposes an\nenvironmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the\ngenerative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location\nembedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS\nlocation information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the\ncross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to\nrespectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as\nthat among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target\nBSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM\ninference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs.\nSpecifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free\nnetworks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM\nconstruction are prohibitively costly. By contrast, the proposed BS-1-to-N\nmodel is able to achieve efficient CKM inference for a target BS at any\npotential location based on the CKMs of source BSs. This is achieved by\nexploiting the fact that within a given area, different BSs share the same\nwireless environment that leads to their respective CKMs. Therefore, similar to\nmulti-view synthesis, CKMs of different BSs are representations of the same\nwireless environment from different BS locations. By mining the implicit\ncorrelation between CKM and BS location based on the wireless environment, the\nproposed BS-1-to-N method achieves efficient CKM inference across BSs.

However, when ITRs are influenced\nby sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or age, they can lead to outcomes\nwhere certain groups are unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged. To address this\ngap, we propose a flexible approach based on the optimal transport theory,\nwhich is capable of transforming any optimal ITR into a fair ITR that ensures\ndemographic parity. Recognizing the potential loss of value under fairness\nconstraints, we introduce an ``improved trade-off ITR,\" designed to balance\nvalue optimization and fairness while accommodating varying levels of fairness\nthrough parameter adjustment.

This is achieved through the\ninterconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave\nreconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at\none port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local\ncontrol of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further\nenhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently,\nchannel reciprocity. This feature potentially benefits communication among\nnon-aligned transceivers. This paper introduces a novel application of\nNR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices\ncommunicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure\ntransmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses\nsignal from all other users, and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a\nphysics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural\nscattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect,\nthe advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate\nan all-user sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization\nalgorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual\ndecomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS\nconsistently outperforms reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and conventional diagonal\n(D)-RIS in terms of sum-rate performance, particularly when more than two\nimpinging and reflection directions need to be supported.

The situation is\nevolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the\nintelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,\ntraditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex\ninteractions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in\nthis paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard\nforecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize\nmeteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United\nStates (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our\nframework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,\nfrost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.\nThe framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a\nrecurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal\nexplanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but\nprecisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive\naccuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's\ncapacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research\nsignificantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard\nEWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process\nfor climate risk management in the agricultural industry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u7684\u591a\u707e\u5bb3\u9884\u8b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u519c\u4e1a\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c14\u5019\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u519c\u4e1a\u98ce\u9669\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u707e\u5bb3\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u707e\u5bb3\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5e8f\u5217\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982BiLSTM\uff09\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982TimeSHAP\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u707e\u5bb3\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u5b9a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fBiLSTM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5173\u952e\u6c14\u5019\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u707e\u5bb3\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u519c\u4e1a\u6c14\u5019\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u6709\u6548\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

Singh"], "title": "Formal Bayesian Transfer Learning via the Total Risk Prior", "comment": null, "summary": "In analyses with severe data-limitations, augmenting the target dataset with\ninformation from ancillary datasets in the application domain, called source\ndatasets, can lead to significantly improved statistical procedures. However,\nexisting methods for this transfer learning struggle to deal with situations\nwhere the source datasets are also limited and not guaranteed to be\nwell-aligned with the target dataset. A typical strategy is to use the\nempirical loss minimizer on the source data as a prior mean for the target\nparameters, which places the estimation of source parameters outside of the\nBayesian formalism. Our key conceptual contribution is to use a risk minimizer\nconditional on source parameters instead. This allows us to construct a single\njoint prior distribution for all parameters from the source datasets as well as\nthe target dataset. As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty\nquantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over\nindicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset.

Weight and activation quantization\n(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and\narithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ\ndesigns. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization\nfor hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy\ndegradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform\nquantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like\ndistributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform\nnature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring\ndequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during\ninference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.\nOffline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant\nmodel performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques\nintroduce substantial runtime overhead.\n  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of\nWAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose\nKLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based\ncomputation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations\non K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and\nfull-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier\ndetection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and\nsmallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.\n  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,\n7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the\nA100 GPU and Atom, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "KLLM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u786c\u4ef6-\u8f6f\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7K-Means\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5747\u5300\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u5927\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91cf\u5316\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u6d6e\u70b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f15\u64ceOrizuru\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u89e3\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aKLLM\u5728A100 GPU\u548cAtom\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b09.67x\u548c7.03x\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u5347229.50x\u548c150.21x\u3002", "conclusion": "KLLM\u901a\u8fc7\u786c\u4ef6-\u8f6f\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u3002"}}

Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across\nthe diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world\napplications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are\ntrained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.\nMeanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are\nfragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance\ncomputing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,\nwe present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a\ntransformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of\nmaterials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and\ntungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured\nand unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of\ntextual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and\nsolver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation\nacross simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture.

Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has\nemerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of\nindividual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,\nthis approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the\nnecessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training\nsamples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and\nscenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the\ndifficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that\nmemorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link\nbetween memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This\nconnection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of\nincremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in\nunlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on\nmore efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned\ncognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence\nApproximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from\nthe incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that\nIAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,\nand comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods\nacross diverse datasets and model architectures.

In this work, we investigate the function\nof process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We\npropose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism\noperating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based\ntraining. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve\nproblems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise\ncorrectness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent\n'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable\ncredit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating\nreward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism\nthat dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's\ncurrent proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative\ntrial-and-error.

Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through\noptimal dynamic pricing for the system.

To address this problem, we\ndevelop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic\npricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite\nspatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first\nvalidate our approach against conventional methods through numerical\nexperiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100\nparameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more\naccurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than\na 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a\nlarge-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,\nresulting in a total of 1156 parameters.

Our method can decompose complex problems,\nautonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and\nperform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking\ncapability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle\nthe shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation\n(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the\nover-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the\nmodel performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent\ntraining strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start\nand these two rewards.

Multivariate curve resolution\n(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base\npatterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in\nunderstanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix\nfactorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually\nunknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the\nscalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This\nstudy reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an\nenergy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the\nsmallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts\nfrom a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable\ngating network to retain only active components while estimating their\nconcentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent\nsources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count\nwithin 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near\nexact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity\nor nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to\nother instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By\nuniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR\noffers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including\nchemical library-driven scenarios.

However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the\nquadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the\nsequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and\nsimilar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of\nsoftmax attention.

The RS ranks the available\nannotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using\ntheir past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as\ninformation about the instance queried.
