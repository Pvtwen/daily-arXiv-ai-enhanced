While Transformer-based models utilizing channel-independence (CI)\nstrategies have demonstrated strong performance in various time series tasks,\nthey often overlook the inter-channel correlations that are critical in\nmultivariate EEG signals. This omission can lead to information degradation and\nreduced prediction accuracy, particularly in complex tasks such as neurological\noutcome prediction. To address these challenges, we propose Biaxialformer,\ncharacterized by a meticulously engineered two-stage attention-based framework.\nThis model independently captures both sequence-specific (temporal) and\nchannel-specific (spatial) EEG information, promoting synergy and mutual\nreinforcement across channels without sacrificing CI. By employing joint\nlearning of positional encodings, Biaxialformer preserves both temporal and\nspatial relationships in EEG data, mitigating the interchannel correlation\nforgetting problem common in traditional CI models. Additionally, a\ntokenization module with variable receptive fields balance the extraction of\nfine-grained, localized features and broader temporal dependencies. To enhance\nspatial feature extraction, we leverage bipolar EEG signals, which capture\ninter-hemispheric brain interactions, a critical but often overlooked aspect in\nEEG analysis. Our study broadens the use of Transformer-based models by\naddressing the challenge of predicting neurological outcomes in comatose\npatients.

By employing a frequency-selective RIS, the system independently\noptimizes both quantum (850 nm) and classical (S-band) channels in real time,\ndynamically adapting to environmental fluctuations such as atmospheric\nturbulence and rain attenuation. The joint optimization of the quantum bit\nerror rate (QBER) and the classical signal-to noise ratio (SNR) is formulated\nas a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling\nefficient adaptive phase control utilizing both quantum and classical\ncomputational methods. Comprehensive theoretical modeling and simulations,\nbenchmarked against experimental data from the Micius satellite, demonstrate\nsubstantial performance gains. Notably, the RIS assisted system reduces QBER\nfrom approximately 2.5% to 0.7%, increases the secure key rate (SKR) to over\n30,000 bits per second, and enhances classical RF SNR by about 3 dB at high\nelevation angles.

The estimation of particle size distributions is\ncommonly formulated as a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, an\nill-posed inverse problem characterized by instability due to measurement noise\nand limited data. To address this, we use a Gaussian process prior to\nregularize the solution and integrate a normalization constraint into the\nGaussian process via two approaches: by constraining the Gaussian process using\na pseudo-measurement and by using Lagrange multipliers in the equivalent\noptimization problem. To improve computational efficiency, we employ a spectral\nexpansion of the covariance kernel using eigenfunctions of the Laplace\noperator, resulting in a computationally tractable low-rank representation\nwithout sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we investigate two complementary\nstrategies for hyperparameter estimation: a data-driven approach based on\nmaximizing the unconstrained log marginal likelihood, and an alternative\napproach where the physical constraints are taken into account.

Notably, it has been shown that when training and sampling are\nperformed perfectly, these models memorise training data -- implying that some\nform of regularisation is essential for generalisation. Existing theoretical\nanalyses primarily rely on algorithm-independent techniques such as uniform\nconvergence, heavily utilising model structure to obtain generalisation bounds.\nIn this work, we instead leverage the algorithmic aspects that promote\ngeneralisation in diffusion models, developing a general theory of\nalgorithm-dependent generalisation for this setting. Borrowing from the\nframework of algorithmic stability, we introduce the notion of score stability,\nwhich quantifies the sensitivity of score-matching algorithms to dataset\nperturbations.

I provide a modern perspective on these approaches. One of Breiman's\nkey arguments against data models is the ''Rashomon Effect,'' which is the\nexistence of many different-but-equally-good models. The Rashomon Effect\nimplies that data modelers would not be able to determine which model generated\nthe data. Conversely, one of his core advantages in favor of data models is\nsimplicity, as he claimed there exists an ''Occam Dilemma,'' i.e., an\naccuracy-simplicity tradeoff. After 25 years of powerful computers, it has\nbecome clear that this claim is not generally true, in that algorithmic models\ndo not need to be complex to be accurate; however, there are nuances that help\nexplain Breiman's logic, specifically, that by ''simple,'' he appears to\nconsider only linear models or unoptimized decision trees. Interestingly, the\nRashomon Effect is a key tool in proving the nullification of the Occam\nDilemma. To his credit though, Breiman did not have the benefit of modern\ncomputers, with which my observations are much easier to make.\n  Breiman's goal for interpretability was somewhat intertwined with causality:\nsimpler models can help reveal which variables have a causal relationship with\nthe outcome. However, I argue that causality can be investigated without the\nuse of single models, whether or not they are simple. Interpretability is\nuseful in its own right, and I think Breiman knew that too.\n  Technically, my modern perspective does not belong to either of Breiman's Two\nCultures, but shares the goals of both of them - causality, simplicity,\naccuracy - and shows that these goals can be accomplished in other ways,\nwithout the limitations Breiman was concerned about.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9Leo Breiman\u7684'\u4e24\u79cd\u6587\u5316'\u89c2\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u3001\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Breiman\u572825\u5e74\u524d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u73b0\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Breiman\u63d0\u51fa\u7684'Rashomon\u6548\u5e94'\u548c'Occam\u56f0\u5883'\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u73b0\u4ee3\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u7a81\u7834Breiman\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d85\u8d8aBreiman'\u4e24\u79cd\u6587\u5316'\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

However, this binary approach\nconflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along\nwith discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant\noperations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving\ncritical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a\ndata-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP\nfirst decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along\nthree dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP\ndetermines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP\niteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance\ndrop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets\ncan be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according\nto this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency\nthrough: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant\nevaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune\" and ``danger-to-prune\"\noperations from sorting. GSOP achieves compelling efficiency-performance\ntradeoffs, reducing computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss while\nmaintaining up to 18% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when\ntransferred across diverse VLMs and tasks.

In some cases, even 8 channels can deliver satisfactory accuracy.\nThese results demonstrate the effectiveness of SHAP-AAD in reducing complexity\nwhile preserving high detection performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "SHAP-AAD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7DeepSHAP\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952eEEG\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7TCN\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u9053\u6570\u91cf\u4f46\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fc7\u591a\u7535\u6781\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7a7f\u6234\u8212\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u9053\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1aDeepSHAP\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7TCN\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548AAD\u3002", "result": "32\u901a\u9053\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd164\u901a\u9053\uff0879.21% vs. 81.06%\uff09\uff0c8\u901a\u9053\u4e5f\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "SHAP-AAD\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

A major challenge is selecting the simplest possible\ncorrect model from vast libraries of candidate models, where standard\ninformation criteria (AIC, BIC) are often limited.\n  We introduce PASTIS (Parsimonious Stochastic Inference), a new information\ncriterion derived from extreme value theory. Its penalty term, $n_\\mathcal{B}\n\\ln(n_0/p)$, explicitly incorporates the size of the initial library of\ncandidate parameters ($n_0$), the number of parameters in the considered model\n($n_\\mathcal{B}$), and a significance threshold ($p$). This significance\nthreshold represents the probability of selecting a model containing more\nparameters than necessary when comparing many models.\n  Benchmarks on various systems (Lorenz, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Lotka-Volterra for\nSDEs; Gray-Scott for SPDEs) demonstrate that PASTIS outperforms AIC, BIC,\ncross-validation (CV), and SINDy (a competing method) in terms of exact model\nidentification and predictive capability.\n  Furthermore, real-world data can be subject to large sampling intervals\n($\\Delta t$) or measurement noise ($\\sigma$), which can impair model learning\nand selection capabilities. To address this, we have developed robust variants\nof PASTIS, PASTIS-$\\Delta t$ and PASTIS-$\\sigma$, thus extending the\napplicability of the approach to imperfect experimental data.\n  PASTIS thus provides a statistically grounded, validated, and practical\nmethodological framework for discovering simple models for processes with\nstochastic dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "PASTIS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08SDEs\uff09\u548c\u968f\u673a\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08SPDEs\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eAIC\u3001BIC\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u5927\u91cf\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u51c6\u5219\uff08\u5982AIC\u3001BIC\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPASTIS\uff0c\u5176\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u57fa\u4e8e\u6781\u503c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u5019\u9009\u53c2\u6570\u5e93\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "PASTIS\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982Lorenz\u3001Gray-Scott\u7b49\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eAIC\u3001BIC\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548cSINDy\u3002", "conclusion": "PASTIS\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u57fa\u7840\u624e\u5b9e\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Furthermore,\nsequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:\nquadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these\nlimitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less\nreliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce\nEcho State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves\nthis challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.\nEST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from\nReservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.\nDrawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of\nthe Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module\ncalled ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent\nnetworks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory\nunits with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical\nreservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained.

This paper proposes the jackknife detector, a fault detection\nmethod tailored for linearized pseudorange-based positioning systems under\nnon-Gaussian nominal errors. Specifically, by leveraging the jackknife\ntechnique, a test statistic is derived as a linear combination of measurement\nerrors, eliminating the need for restrictive distributional assumptions while\nmaintaining computational efficiency. A hypothesis test with the Bonferroni\ncorrection is then constructed to detect potential faults in measurements.\nTheoretical analysis proves the equivalence between the jackknife detector and\nthe solution separation (SS) detector, while revealing the former's superior\ncomputational efficiency.

In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free\ngraph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from\nmathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The\nsimple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small\nadjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range\nof different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned\nprompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The\nmodifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from\nsimple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if\nany, adjustments to the architecture.

Conventional receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) and\nadvanced RAIM (ARAIM) rely heavily on Gaussian models in bounding nominal\nerrors, which can be overly conservative with real-world non-Gaussian errors\nwith heavy tails, such as the satellite clock and orbit errors. This paper\nproposes an extended jackknife detector capable of detecting multiple\nsimultaneous faults with non-Gaussian nominal errors. Furthermore, an integrity\nmonitoring algorithm, jackknife ARAIM, is developed by systematically\nexploiting the properties of the jackknife detector in the range domain. A\ntight bound of the integrity risk is derived by quantifying the impacts of\nhypothetical fault vectors on the position solution. The proposed method is\nexamined in worldwide simulations, with the nominal measurement error simulated\nbased on authentic experimental data, which reveals different findings in\nexisting research. In a setting of a single Global Positioning System (GPS)\nconstellation, the proposed method reduces the 99.5 percentile vertical\nprotection level (VPL) 45m, where the VPL of the baseline ARAIM is larger than\n50m in most user locations. For dual-constellation (GPS-Galileo) settings,\nbaseline ARAIM suffers VPL inflation over 60m due to the over-conservatism\ninduced by the heavy-tailed Galileo signal-in-space range errors, whereas the\nproposed jackknife ARAIM retains VPL below 40m, achieving over 92% normal\noperations for a 35m Vertical Alert Limit.

To\nenable higher data rates and more accurate sensing, terahertz (THz) systems\nempowered by extremely large multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO)\ntechnology are envisioned as key enablers for future ISAC systems. Owing to the\nsubstantial increase in both effective array aperture and carrier frequency, a\nconsiderable portion of future ISAC applications is anticipated to fall within\nthe near-field coverage region, instead of the conventional far-field. However,\nmost existing ISAC techniques are designed under the far-field planar wave\nassumption, struggling to accommodate the unique characteristics of THz\nnear-field propagation. To motivate future research into near-field ISAC\nresearch, we systematically investigate the characteristics of THz near-field\npropagation and explore its potential to facilitate ISAC systems.

In this setting, an LLM\nagent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant\ninformation from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper\nexplores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected\nnumber of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy\nalgorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information\ngain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate\nestimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very\ndifficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which\nleads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better\nestimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information\nPursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on\nconformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship\nbetween prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate\nuncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets.

With the ever-increasing demand for high\ndata rates and system scalability, the fronthaul load becomes a critical\nbottleneck. Our method uses O-RAN compression techniques to efficiently\ncompress the fronthaul signals. The goal is to greatly lower the fronthaul load\nwhile having little effect on the overall system performance, as shown by Block\nError Rate (BLER) curves. Through rigorous link-level simulations, we compare\nour quantization strategies against a benchmark scenario with no quantization,\nproviding insights into the trade-offs between fronthaul data rate reduction\nand link performance integrity. The results demonstrate that our proposed\nquantization techniques not only lower the fronthaul load but also maintain a\ncompetitive link quality, making them a viable solution for enhancing the\nefficiency of next-generation wireless networks.

In this paper we propose a statistical framework based on\nBayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to\nsimultaneously assess their autograders while also addressing their primary\nresearch questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation\noutcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of\nthe grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response\nlength or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of\nscoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In\naddition, our method can be used to augment traditional reliability metrics\nsuch as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and\nclarifying the source of disagreement.

However, interpretable models often struggle to\nachieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for\nhigh-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable\nregression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic\ncodes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are\ninfrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge\ncan address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we\ndemonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective\nregularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all\ndiagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters\n(e.g., T67.0XXA, T67.0XXD) to six (e.g., T67.0XX) or fewer, we reduce the\ndimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model\ninterpretability and consistency.

It investigates how an analyst can determine\nif an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer\n(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The\nchapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing\nthe continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random\nhorizon.

However, optimizing\ncompound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures\nand diverse configuration types across components, including prompts,\nhyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose\nOptimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.\nThe core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per\ncomponent, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each\ncomponent's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each\niteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while\nsimultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables\nindependent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated\noptimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead\nto performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world\ncompound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an\naverage improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for\nimproving compound systems.

To close this gap, we here introduce a\nsolution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than\nscaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early\ninfancy into adulthood.

While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a\nmemory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to\nmulti-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute\nthroughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading\nmodel parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with\ndual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its\nsingle-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we\npresent DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed\nzeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:\n(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed\nforward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted\nto the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism\ndesign that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication\nbottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware\ncommunication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them\nacross GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink.

However, the existing layer-stacking strategy in GNTK\nintroduces redundant computations, significantly increasing computational\ncomplexity and limiting scalability for practical applications. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes the Simplified Graph Neural Tangent Kernel\n(SGTK), which replaces the traditional multi-layer stacking mechanism with a\ncontinuous $K$-step aggregation operation. This novel approach streamlines the\niterative kernel computation process, effectively eliminating redundant\ncalculations while preserving the kernel's expressiveness. By reducing the\ndependency on layer stacking, SGTK achieves both computational simplicity and\nefficiency. Furthermore, we introduce the Simplified Graph Neural Kernel\n(SGNK), which models infinitely wide Graph Neural Networks as Gaussian\nProcesses. This allows kernel values to be directly determined from the\nexpected outputs of activation functions in the infinite-width regime,\nbypassing the need for explicit layer-by-layer computation. SGNK further\nreduces computational complexity while maintaining the capacity to capture\nintricate structural patterns in graphs. Extensive experiments on node and\ngraph classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed SGTK and SGNK achieve\nperformance comparable to existing approaches while improving computational\nefficiency.

While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks\n(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their\nextension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,\nthe challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled\nphysical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses\na foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator\nreflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we\npresent the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet\nvariants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly\ncoupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with\ndual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional\ncoupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic\nthermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient\nphase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical\nDeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked\nusing both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our\nresults demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is\ncrucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch\ncounterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer\nadvantages for decoupled or single-physics problems.

A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that\nshed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we\nintroduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art\ncosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours\nand generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of\nits kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter\nhalos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand\ndirected trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time\nscales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict\ncosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the\nvelocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,\nand to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time\nscales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established\napproaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.\nFor the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that\nare minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more\ncomputationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural\nnetworks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features\nsometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far\nlonger training times.

Business angels offer a\ncritical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and\nresource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has\ninvestigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels\nconsider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more\nthan 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated\npost-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own\ndecisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals\nand several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work\nvalidating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its\nadoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we\nprompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors\nto a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business\nangel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated\nmachine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as\ninput features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy\n(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant\ncorrelation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional\nhuman-graded evaluations.

To address this, we introduce the\nMulti-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built\non the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles\nmultivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The\nproposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and\nseparates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions\ninto two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike\nprior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across\nall traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises\nin practice. Our results show that MCST-Mamba achieves strong predictive\nperformance with a lower parameter count compared to baseline models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u901a\u9053\u65f6\u7a7a\uff08MCST\uff09Mamba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u51b5\u3001\u591a\u53d8\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u5929\u6c14\u548c\u4e8b\u6545\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u4e00\u53d8\u91cf\u6216\u9700\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u5355\u72ec\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMCST-Mamba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u7a7a\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u79bb\u65f6\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528Mamba\u5757\u3002", "result": "MCST-Mamba\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4ea4\u901a\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u5c11\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "MCST-Mamba\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Its common\nsolution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a\nsubstitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers\nare trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted\nteachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation\ninto distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the\ntransferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is\nprohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's\nattention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This\nhinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit\nDFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,\ninspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness\non OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups\naccording to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and\nused for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as\nOOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge.

Empirical results on our Tencent App Store dataset and two public\ndatasets demonstrate that our approach performs well compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods. The approach has been deployed at Tencent and the\nmultilabel classification outputs for apps have helped a downstream\ntask--credit risk management of user--improve its performance by 10.70% with\nregard to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric, for over one year.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5HMCN\u548cHMCL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5e94\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u6807\u7b7e\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002", "method": "1) HMCN\uff1a\u4ece\u65e0\u5c42\u6b21\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ea6\u675f\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b2) HMCL\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u817e\u8baf\u5e94\u7528\u5546\u5e97\u548c\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534710.70%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Existing methods address\nstructural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start\ninference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,\nthis results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further\nchallenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose\nNeighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer\nframework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a\nself-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention\nmask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a \"student\"\nprediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and\na \"teacher\" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This\nenables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby\nfully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To\nhandle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a\none-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature\ndata into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.\nExperimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior\nperformance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "NTSFormer\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u56feTransformer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b64\u7acb\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u9762\u4e34\u8282\u70b9\u5b64\u7acb\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982MLP\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "NTSFormer\u91c7\u7528\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u548cMoE\u8f93\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNTSFormer\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "NTSFormer\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In fields such as planning for reinforcement learning,\nsimilar challenges are being addressed with denoising diffusion models. In this\nwork, we propose an object-centric denoising diffusion model architecture for\nphysical reasoning that is translation equivariant over time, permutation\nequivariant over objects, and can be conditioned on arbitrary time steps for\narbitrary objects.

However, existing benchmarks\npredominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's\ncapability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is\ncrucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction\nprediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,\nmulti-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818\ninteractions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and\nleakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two\ncomplementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess\nintra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented\ntasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and\nessential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's\ncapability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein\nfunction annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism\nanalysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,\nconsisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language\nmodel-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI\nmodels have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional\nproperties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world\nbiological applications.

We also demonstrate that\nthis approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical\ndata on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters\nsimultaneously.
