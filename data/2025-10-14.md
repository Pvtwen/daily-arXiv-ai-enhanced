Abstract: Deep learning-based radio frequency fingerprinting (RFFP) has become an
enabling physical-layer security technology, allowing device identification and
authentication through received RF signals. This technology, however, faces
significant challenges when it comes to adapting to domain variations, such as
time, location, environment, receiver and channel. For Bluetooth Low Energy
(BLE) devices, addressing these challenges is particularly crucial due to the
BLE protocol's frequency-hopping nature. In this work, and for the first time,
we investigated the frequency hopping effect on RFFP of BLE devices, and
proposed a novel, low-cost, domain-adaptive feature extraction method. Our
approach improves the classification accuracy by up to 58\% across environments
and up to 80\% across receivers compared to existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to flexibly
reconfigure wireless channels by adjusting antenna placement. In this paper, we
study a dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) system enhanced with movable
antennas. To ensure communication security, we aim to maximize the achievable
sum rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors, receiving
filter, and antenna placement, subject to radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
performance and transmission covertness constraints. To tackle this challenging
optimization problem, we first employ a Lagrangian dual transformation process
to reformulate it into a more tractable form. Subsequently, the problem is
solved by introducing a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, incorporating
semidefinite relaxation (SDR), projected gradient descent (PGD), and successive
convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method can significantly improve the covert sum rate, and achieve a
satisfactory balance between the communication and radar performance compared
with existing benchmark schemes by leveraging the flexibility of movable
antennas.

TL;DR: 本文研究了有源智能反射表面(AIRS)辅助的无线通信系统，通过联合优化基站波束成形、AIRS波束成形和AIRS元件分配来最大化上下行链路的加权和速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究有源智能反射表面在无线通信系统中的应用，解决传统无源IRS的局限性，提升通信性能。

Method: 提出了三种部署方案：分布式AIRS、基站侧AIRS和用户侧AIRS。针对分布式AIRS，推导了最优和近似最优闭式解。对于多用户情况，考虑了用户自适应和静态两种波束成形策略，并开发了高效的交替优化算法。

Conclusion: 分布式AIRS部署方案在无线通信系统中表现出优越性能，动态波束成形策略能够有效提升系统速率性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided
wireless communication system, where active IRSs (AIRSs) are deployed to assist
communication between a base station (BS) and users of both the uplink (UL) and
downlink (DL). We aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of UL and DL
communications through joint optimization of BS, AIRS beamforming, and AIRS
element allocation. First, we study three deployment schemes, namely
distributed AIRSs, BS-side AIRS, and user-side AIRS. For distributed AIRSs,
both optimal and near-optimal solutions are derived in closed form. To draw
useful insights, we analytically compare the deployment schemes in terms of the
rate performance under the single-user setup. For the multi-user case, we
consider two beamforming setups at the distributed AIRSs to balance performance
and complexity tradeoffs. Regarding the user-adaptive AIRS beamforming,
different AIRS beamforming vectors are adopted for each user; while for the
static AIRS beamforming, all users share the same beamforming vectors, with
identical phase shifts but different amplitudes for UL and DL. With the
user-adaptive AIRS beamforming, we focus on the optimization of element
allocation for rate maximization. With static AIRS beamforming, we solve the
rate maximization problem by optimizing the BS transmit/receive beamformers,
user beamforming, and AIRS beamforming. Despite its non-convexity, we develop
an efficient alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm that solves each
sub-problem optimally. Numerical results validate the practical advantages of
distributed AIRSs compared to passive IRS (PIRS), BS-side AIRS, and user-side
AIRS, and highlight the benefits of dynamic IRS beamforming.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于相位移相器极化可重构天线的MIMO雷达系统，通过联合优化发射样本协方差矩阵和收发相位偏移向量来最小化贝叶斯克拉美罗下界，提升目标角度定位的感知性能。

Conclusion: 极化可重构天线为MIMO雷达系统提供了新的设计自由度，所提出的联合优化算法能够有效利用这些自由度来最小化贝叶斯克拉美罗下界，从而提升目标角度定位的感知精度。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
radar system aided by phase shifter based polarization-reconfigurable antennas
(PRAs). Specifically, a base station (BS) equipped with multiple PRAs at both
the transmitter and the receiver aims to sense the unknown and random angular
location parameter of a point target via sending wireless signals and
processing the received echo signals reflected by the target, where only prior
distribution information about the location parameter is available for
exploitation. Firstly, we characterize the sensing performance of this novel
PRA-based MIMO radar system by deriving the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB)
of the mean-squared error (MSE) in estimating the desired location parameter
with prior distribution information. Then, to fully exploit the new design
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) empowered by PRAs, we study the joint optimization of
the transmit sample covariance matrix as well as the transmit and receive phase
shift vectors to minimize the sensing BCRB subject to a transmit power
constraint. This problem is non-convex and difficult to solve due to the
coupling among optimization variables. To resolve this issue, we develop an
alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm which iteratively obtains the
closed-form optimal solution to each variable with the others being fixed at
each time, thus being guaranteed to converge to at least a stationary point of
the joint optimization problem. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of
the proposed algorithm.

Result: WLCT提供了新的三维时频-调频率表示，能够有效处理信号分量在时频域重叠的问题。

Conclusion: 窗口线性正则变换在三维信号分离方面具有巨大潜力，为处理非平稳信号叠加问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In nature, signals often appear in the form of the superposition of multiple
non-stationary signals. The overlap of signal components in the time-frequency
domain poses a significant challenge for signal analysis. One approach to
addressing this problem is to introduce an additional chirprate parameter and
use the chirplet transform (CT) to elevate the two-dimensional time-frequency
representation to a three-dimensional time-frequency-chirprate representation.
From a certain point of view, the CT of a signal can be regarded as a windowed
special linear canonical transform of that signal, undergoing a shift and a
modulation.
  In this paper, we develop this idea to propose a novel windowed linear
canonical transform (WLCT), which provides a new time-frequency-chirprate
representation. We discuss four types of WLCTs. In addition, we use a special
X-ray transform to further sharpen the time-frequency-chirprate representation.
Furthermore, we derive the corresponding three-dimensional synchrosqueezed
transform, demonstrating that the WLCTs have great potential for
three-dimensional signal separation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统里德堡原子量子接收器（RAQR）虽然对弱信号的幅度和相位检测精度很高，但由于原子能级的离散性和固有瞬时带宽限制，无法准确接收宽带射频信号，这限制了其在多载波通信和感知中的直接应用。

Method: 提出五能级多载波里德堡原子量子接收器（MC-RAQR）结构，推导了MC-RAQR的幅度和相位，并提取基带电信号进行处理。分析了多载波通信的信道容量以及到达角（AoA）和距离参数的感知精度。

Conclusion: MC-RAQR与OFDM等波形兼容，在多载波信号接收方面具有显著优势，显著提升了多载波通信的信道容量和多目标感知的分辨率。

Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have attracted significant attention
in recent years due to their ultra-high sensitivity. Although capable of
precisely detecting the amplitude and phase of weak signals, conventional RAQRs
face inherent limitations in accurately receiving wideband RF signals, due to
the discrete nature of atomic energy levels and their intrinsic instantaneous
bandwidth constraints. These limitations hinder their direct application to
multi-carrier communication and sensing. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a multi-carrier Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (MC-RAQR) structure
with five energy levels. We derive the amplitude and phase of the MC-RAQR and
extract the baseband electrical signal for signal processing. In terms of
multi-carrier communication and sensing, we analyze the channel capacity and
accuracy of angle of arrival (AoA) and distance parameters, respectively.
Numerical results validate our proposed model, showing that the MC-RAQR can
achieve up to a bandwidth of 14 MHz, which is 56-fold larger than the
conventional RAQRs. As a result, the channel capacity and the resolution for
multi-target sensing are improved significantly. Specifically, the channel
capacity of MC-RAQR is 22-fold and 3-fold larger than the conventional antennas
and RAQRs, respectively. For sensing performance, the MSE of AoA estimation for
MC-RAQR is 0.16% of the conventional RAQR and the MSE of distance estimation is
0.01% of the CRB of conventional antennas, showing the superior performance of
the MC-RAQR. This demonstrates its compatibility with waveforms such as
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and its significant
advantages for multi-carrier signal reception.

Conclusion: 该联合优化框架不仅消除了传统策略所需的繁琐网格搜索，还显著提高了滤波系统的灵活性和训练稳定性。

Abstract: The graph linear canonical transform (GLCT)-based filtering methods often
optimize transform parameters and filters separately, which results in high
computational costs and limited stability. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a trainable joint optimization framework that combines GLCT parameters
and Wiener filtering into an end-to-end learning process, allowing for
synergistic optimization between transform domain construction and filtering
operations. The proposed method not only eliminates the cumbersome grid search
required by traditional strategies but also significantly enhances the
flexibility and training stability of the filtering system. Experimental
results on real-world graph data show the proposed method outperforms existing
methods in denoising tasks, featuring superior denoising performance, higher
robustness and lower computational complexity.

Main category: eess.SP

Motivation: 传统有向图信号处理依赖固定表示矩阵，其刚性结构限制了模型适应复杂图拓扑的能力。

Method: 使用参数化UGRM定义广义图傅里叶变换，通过SVD构建谱变换对，并扩展到笛卡尔积图的两种UGRM-GFT方法：直接对复合矩阵SVD和分别对因子图SVD再组合。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在去噪任务中显著优于传统固定矩阵方法，特别是在信噪比和带宽效率方面。

Conclusion: UGRM-GFT方法通过参数化表示矩阵和SVD分解，有效提升了有向图和笛卡尔积图信号处理的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Traditional directed graph signal processing generally depends on fixed
representation matrices, whose rigid structures limit the model's ability to
adapt to complex graph topologies. To address this issue, this study employed
the unified graph representation matrix (UGRM) to propose a generalized graph
Fourier transform (UGRM-GFT) method based on singular value decomposition (SVD)
for signal analysis on directed graphs and Cartesian product graphs. We defined
UGRM-GFT for general directed graphs by introducing a parameterized UGRM that
incorporates traditional representations such as the Laplacian matrix and
adjacency matrix. The SVD is used to construct spectral transform pairs with
both left and right singular vectors. We extended this approach to two types of
UGRM-GFTs applied to directed Cartesian product graphs. UGRM-GFT-I performs SVD
directly on the composite UGRM matrix of the two-dimensional graph structure,
suitable for globally coupled graph signals. UGRM-GFT-II separately applies SVD
to the UGRMs of the two-factor graphs and then combines the results,
significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving spectral
expressiveness. Theoretical analysis confirmed the monotonicity of the proposed
method with respect to the parameters alpha and k embedded in the UGRM.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed
method significantly outperforms traditional fixed-matrix approaches in
denoising tasks, with a particular emphasis on signal-to-noise ratio and
bandwidth efficiency.

Abstract: This study proposes a multi-radar system for non-contact physiological

demonstrate that, compared with a single-radar setup, the proposed system
reduced the root mean square error of the respiratory interval by 35.5%,
decreased the mean absolute error of the respiratory rate by 30.8%, and

Abstract: Accurate channel prediction and effective beamforming are essential for low
Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications to enhance system capacity and
enable high-speed connectivity. Most existing channel prediction and predictive
beamforming methods are limited by model generalization capabilities and
struggle to adapt to time-varying wireless propagation environments. Inspired
by the remarkable generalization and reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), this work proposes an LLM-based channel prediction framework,
namely CPLLM, to forecast future channel state information (CSI) for LEO
satellites based on historical CSI data. In the proposed CPLLM, a dedicated CSI
encoder is designed to map raw CSI data into the textual embedding space,
effectively bridging the modality gap and enabling the LLM to perform reliable
reasoning over CSI data. Additionally, a CSI decoder is introduced to
simultaneously predict CSI for multiple future time slots, substantially
reducing the computational burden and inference latency associated with the
inherent autoregressive decoding process of LLMs. Then, instead of training the
LLM from scratch, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e.,
LoRA, for CPLLM, where the pretrained LLM remains frozen and trainable low-rank
matrices are injected into each Transformer decoder layer to enable effective
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we extend CPLLM to directly generate beamforming
strategies for future time slots based on historical CSI data, namely BFLLM.
This extended framework retains the same architecture as CPLLM, while
introducing a dedicated beamforming decoder to output beamforming strategies.
Finally, extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed approaches in channel prediction and predictive beamforming for LEO
satellite communications.

Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system
covert waveform design method for complex clutter environments, with the core
objective of maximizing the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR). The
design achieves efficient clutter suppression while meeting the covertness
requirement through joint optimization of the transmit waveform and receive
filter, enabling cooperative radar detection and wireless communication. This
study presents key innovations that explicitly address target Doppler shift
uncertainty, significantly enhancing system robustness against Doppler effects.
To ensure communication reliability, the method incorporates phase difference
constraints between communication signal elements in the waveform design, along
with energy constraint, covert constraint, and peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) constraint. The original non-convex optimization problem is transformed
into a tractable convex optimization form through convex optimization
technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized waveform not only
satisfies the covertness requirement in complex clutter environment, but also
achieves superior target detection performance. It also ensures reliable
communication and confirms the effectiveness of propose method.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究分析了6G网络中FR3频段（7-24 GHz）基站的功耗与数据速率关系，比较了混合部分连接波束成形与全数字波束成形的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G网络研究对FR3频段的关注增加，需要了解具有数千天线单元的新型基站架构的功耗特性及其与数据速率的关系。

Method: 建立了基站功耗模型，包括数字和模拟信号处理、功率放大器、供电和冷却系统在四个阶段（数据、信令、微睡眠和空闲）的功耗，比较了混合部分连接波束成形与全数字波束成形。

Conclusion: 混合波束成形在FR3频段基站中能够提供高数据速率的同时显著改善能效，是6G网络中有前景的技术方案。

Abstract: Increasing attention is given to the upper mid-band or Frequency Range 3
(FR3), from 7 to 24 GHz, in the research towards sixth-generation (6G)
networks. Promises of offering large data rates at favorable propagation
conditions are leading to novel FR3 base station (BS) architectures, with up to
thousands of antenna elements and radio-frequency (RF) chains. This work
investigates the power consumption of prospective FR3 BSs and its relation to
the delivered data rates. We model the power consumed by digital and analog
signal processing, power amplifiers (PAs), and supply and cooling during four
phases (data, signaling, micro-sleep, and idle) in downlink and uplink. Hybrid
partially-connected beamforming is compared to fully-digital one. Results show
that, for BS arrays with $1024$ antennas at $30\%$ of load, the PA consumes
most of the power when $64$ or less RF chains are utilized, while the digital
and analog processing consumption takes over when the number of RF chains is
$512$ or more. The digital plus analog processing consumes $2\times$ to
$4\times$ more than the PA for fully-digital beamforming. Hybrid beamforming
achieves $1.3$ Gbit/s/user in downlink while improving the energy efficiency by
$1.4\times$ compared to fully-digital beamforming.

*Rajat Bhattacharjya,Woohyeok Park,Arnab Sarkar,Hyunwoo Oh,Mohsen Imani,Nikil Dutt*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: HYPERDOA是一种基于超维计算的新型到达方向估计算法，在低信噪比条件下比现有方法准确度提高约35.39%，同时在嵌入式平台上能耗降低约93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DoA估计算法在低信噪比条件下精度不足，而现代深度学习方法能耗高且不透明，不适合资源受限的安全关键系统。

Method: 采用超维计算框架，引入两种特征提取策略（均值空间滞后自相关和空间平滑），将DoA估计重新定义为模式识别问题。

Result: 在低信噪比相干源场景下，HYPERDOA比最先进方法准确度提高约35.39%，在NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX嵌入式平台上能耗降低约93%。

Conclusion: HYPERDOA在准确性和效率上的双重优势，使其成为边缘设备上任务关键应用的稳健可行解决方案。

Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation techniques face a critical trade-off,
as classical methods often lack accuracy in challenging, low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) conditions, while modern deep learning approaches are too
energy-intensive and opaque for resource-constrained, safety-critical systems.
We introduce HYPERDOA, a novel estimator leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing
(HDC). The framework introduces two distinct feature extraction strategies --
Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- for its HDC pipeline,
and then reframes DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem. This
approach leverages HDC's inherent robustness to noise and its transparent
algebraic operations to bypass the expensive matrix decompositions and
``black-box'' nature of classical and deep learning methods, respectively. Our
evaluation demonstrates that HYPERDOA achieves ~35.39% higher accuracy than
state-of-the-art methods in low-SNR, coherent-source scenarios. Crucially, it
also consumes ~93% less energy than competing neural baselines on an embedded
NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform. This dual advantage in accuracy and
efficiency establishes HYPERDOA as a robust and viable solution for
mission-critical applications on edge devices.

Abstract: Direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation with leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) offers
a compact and cost-effective alternative to conventional antenna arrays but
remains challenging in the presence of coherent sources. To address this issue,
we propose a spatially filtered sparse Bayesian learning (SF-SBL) framework.
Firstly, the field of view (FoV) is divided into angular sectors according to
the frequency beam-scanning property of LWAs, and Bayesian inverse problems are
then solved within each sector to improve efficiency and reduce computational
cost. Both on-grid SBL and off-grid SBL formulations are developed. Simulation
results show that the proposed approach achieves robust and accurate DoA
estimation, even with coherent sources.

Abstract: Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation in sensor arrays faces limitations
under demanding conditions, including low signal-to-noise ratio,
single-snapshot scenarios, coherent sources, and unknown source counts.
Conventional beamforming suffers from sidelobe interference, adaptive methods
(e.g., MVDR) and subspace algorithms (e.g., MUSIC) degrade with limited
snapshots or coherent signals, while sparse-recovery approaches (e.g., L1-SVD)
incur high computational complexity for large arrays. In this article, we
construct the concept of the optimal spatial filter to solve the DOA estimation
problem under demanding conditions by utilizing the sparsity of spatial
signals. By utilizing the concept of the optimal spatial filter, we have
transformed the DOA estimation problem into a solution problem for the optimal
spatial filter. We propose the Spatial Signal Focusing and Noise Suppression
(SSFNS) algorithm, which is a novel DOA estimation framework grounded in the
theoretical existence of an optimal spatial filter, to solve for the optimal
spatial filter and obtain DOA. Through experiments, it was found that the
proposed algorithm is suitable for large aperture two-dimensional arrays and
experiments have shown that our proposed algorithm performs better than other
algorithms in scenarios with few snapshots or even a single snapshot, low
signal-to-noise ratio, coherent signals, and unknown signal numbers in
two-dimensional large aperture arrays.

Abstract: Pinching antennas (PAs), as an emerging flexible-antenna technology, enables
movable PAs deployed along waveguides to customize channel conditions over a
large scale. This paper investigates an application of PAs to enable
physical-layer security (PLS) by enlarging the channel condition diversity
between legitimate users (LUs) and eavesdroppers (Eves). Particularly, we focus
on the dual-waveguide scenario, where the two waveguides employs multiple PAs
to serve multiple LUs in the presence of an Eve. Specifically, we consider two
waveguide placement strategies, i.e., parallel placement and orthogonal
placement. Meanwhile, we incorporate two channel models, i.e., in-waveguide
phase shifts, and in-waveguide phase shifts and attenuation. We formulate the
secure sum rate (SSR) and secure energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problems,
and propose a two-stage algorithm to solve them. The first stage adopts a
particle swarm optimization (PSO) method with an improved feasibility module,
termed FeaPSO, for PA placement, and the second stage employs the successive
convex approximate (SCA) method to optimize beamforming and artificial noise
vectors. Furthermore, we conduct numerical comparisons between the two
placement strategies in terms of average performance and a special case where
an Eve is positioned in front of LUs. Numerical results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that PAs can
significantly improve both SSR and SEE. Additionally, the necessity of
orthogonal waveguide placement is explicitly verified.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电磁通信正接近其物理和热力学极限，频谱优化带来的性能提升日益不可持续，带宽有限、高频传播损耗以及能量与信息之间的固有权衡限制了6G及以后系统的可扩展性。

Method: 引入状态中心框架，识别了十个定义后电磁时代潜在载体和交互机制的基础范式，并制定了实现自组织、认知集成网络的研究路线图。

Conclusion: 通过建立这一转型的概念基础，为未来研究提供了基础，旨在实现超越频谱受限系统限制的通信范式。

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) communication is nearing its physical and thermodynamic
limits, where further performance gains through spectrum optimization alone
have become increasingly unsustainable. Finite bandwidth, propagation loss at
higher frequencies, and the inherent trade-offs between energy and information
constrain the scalability of 6G and beyond systems. These limitations drive the
search for alternative mechanisms for information transfer beyond conventional
EM propagation. This work introduces a state-centric framework for post-6G
communication, in which information is conveyed by manipulating physical,
biological, and cognitive states rather than EM waves. It identifies ten
foundational paradigms that define potential carriers and interaction
mechanisms for the post-electromagnetic era and outlines a research roadmap
toward self-organizing, cognitively integrated networks. Together, these
developments envision a new class of communication systems that are
energy-aware, adaptive, and capable of uniting matter, life, and intelligence
within a single informational continuum. By establishing the conceptual basis
for this transition, the work provides a foundation for future research aimed
at realizing communication paradigms that transcend the limitations of
spectrum-bound systems.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology offers significant
promise in enhancing wireless communication systems, but its dual-use potential
also introduces substantial security risks. This survey explores the security
implications of RIS in next-generation wireless networks. We first highlight
the dual-use nature of RIS, demonstrating how its communication-enhancing
capabilities can be exploited by adversaries to compromise legitimate users. We
identify a new class of security vulnerabilities termed ``passive-active hybrid
attacks,'' where RIS, despite passively handling signals, can be reconfigured
to actively engage in malicious activities, enabling various RIS-assisted
attacks, such as eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle (MITM), replay, reflection
jamming, and side-channel attacks. Furthermore, we reveal how adversaries can
exploit the openness of wireless channels to introduce adversarial
perturbations in artificial intelligence-driven RIS networks, disrupting
communication terminals and causing misclassifications or errors in RIS
reflection predictions. Despite these risks, RIS technology also plays a
critical role in enhancing security and privacy across radio frequency (RF) and
visible light communication (VLC) systems. By synthesizing current insights and
highlighting emerging threats, we provide actionable insights into cross-layer
collaboration, advanced adversarial defenses, and the balance between security
and cost. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of RIS technology's
security landscape and underscores the urgent need for robust security
frameworks in the development of future wireless systems.

TL;DR: 提出基于扩散模型的概率性CSI预测框架，通过分解为时序编码器和扩散生成器，支持多种推理方案和架构，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CSI获取面临高导频开销和信道老化问题，现有深度学习方法多为确定性映射，难以捕捉无线信道的随机性和多模态特性。

Method: 将CSI预测分解为时序编码器和扩散生成器，探索自回归和序列到序列两种推理方案，使用U-Net和Transformer架构，并采用DDIM调度降低复杂度。

Result: 大量仿真表明，基于扩散模型的方案在CSI预测方面显著优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 扩散模型为CSI预测提供了灵活的概率框架，能够有效捕捉信道动态特性，在性能上具有显著优势。

Abstract: Acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for reliable
and efficient wireless communication, but challenges such as high pilot
overhead and channel aging hinder timely and accurate CSI acquisition. CSI
prediction, which forecasts future CSI from historical observations, offers a
promising solution. Recent deep learning approaches, including recurrent neural
networks and Transformers, have achieved notable success but typically learn
deterministic mappings, limiting their ability to capture the stochastic and
multimodal nature of wireless channels. In this paper, we introduce a novel
probabilistic framework for CSI prediction based on diffusion models, offering
a flexible design that supports integration of diverse prediction schemes. We
decompose the CSI prediction task into two components: a temporal encoder,
which extracts channel dynamics, and a diffusion-based generator, which
produces future CSI samples. We investigate two inference
schemes-autoregressive and sequence-to-sequence- and explore multiple diffusion
backbones, including U-Net and Transformer-based architectures. Furthermore, we
examine a diffusion-based approach without an explicit temporal encoder and
utilize the DDIM scheduling to reduce model complexity. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that our diffusion-based models significantly outperform
state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文对OFDM、OTFS、AFDM和CP-AFDM四种多载波波形的模糊函数特性进行了统一分析，为6G网络中集成感知与通信的波形设计提供了基准比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为未来6G网络中集成感知与通信系统提供波形选择的理论依据，建立统一的波形感知能力比较基准。

Method: 直接从离散时间定义获取每种波形的模糊函数，通过理想分数插值增强，在归一化延迟-多普勒单位下评估模糊函数和相关指标。

Result: OFDM具有优异的延迟分辨率和旁瓣特性但多普勒响应较差，而先进波形在延迟和多普勒分辨率之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 建立了波形感知能力的一致比较基准，确认了已知行为：不同波形在延迟-多普勒性能上各有优劣，为ISAC设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified and system-agnostic analysis of the ambiguity
function (AF) characteristics of four representative multicarrier waveforms,
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency
space (OTFS), affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), and chirp-permuted
AFDM (CP-AFDM), which are considered as key candidates for enabling integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) in future sixth generation (6G) networks. The
AF of each waveform is obtained directly from its discrete-time definition and
enhanced via ideal fractional interpolation, enabling precise characterization
of its continuous-time delay-Doppler response. Two signaling modes are
examined: a communication-oriented case with random information symbols
suitable only for monostatic scenarios, and a sensing-oriented case with fixed
unimodular symbols suitable for general multi-static scenarios. Furthermore,
the AFs and the ambiguity metrics including the 3dB mainlobe width,
peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR), and integrated sidelobe ratio (ISLR), are
evaluated in normalized delay-Doppler units, enabling direct translation to any
physical system configuration defined by bandwidth, sampling frequency, or
symbol duration, while ensuring straightforward and consistent comparison
across waveforms. The results establish a consistent benchmark for comparing
waveform sensing capabilities in ISAC design, consolidating known behaviors:
OFDM exhibits excellent delay resolution and sidelobe behavior but poor Doppler
response, whereas advanced waveforms achieve improved balance between delay and
Doppler resolution with varying sidelobe characteristics. The simulation code
of the smooth AFs, is openly shared to promote reproducibility and support
future ISAC waveform research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的二维图分数傅里叶变换(2D-GFRFT)对笛卡尔积的两个因子图使用相同的分数阶，这限制了其对异构信号的适应能力。需要一种能够为不同因子图分配独立分数阶的方法。

Method: 提出了2D-GBFRFT，保持可分离性的同时为因子图分配独立分数阶；建立了可逆性、酉性和指数可加性；开发了两种滤波方案：网格搜索的维纳式设计和联合优化变换阶数与对角谱滤波器的可微分框架；还引入了与联合时间-顶点分数傅里叶变换(JFRFT)的混合插值方法。

Conclusion: 2D-GBFRFT在GSP滤波中展现出多功能性和优越性能，为处理异构信号提供了更灵活有效的工具。

Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) advances spectral analysis on irregular
domains. However, existing two-dimensional graph fractional Fourier transform
(2D-GFRFT) employs a single fractional order for both factor graphs, thereby
limiting its adaptability to heterogeneous signals. We proposed the
two-dimensional graph bi-fractional Fourier transform (2D-GBFRFT), which
assigns independent fractional orders to the factor graphs of a Cartesian
product while preserving separability. We established invertibility, unitarity,
and index additivity, and developed two filtering schemes: a Wiener-style
design through grid search and a differentiable framework that jointly
optimizes transform orders and diagonal spectral filters. We further introduced
a hybrid interpolation with the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform
(JFRFT), controlled by a tunable parameter that balances the two methods. In
the domains of synthetic Cartesian product graph signals, authentic temporal
graph datasets, and dynamic image deblurring, 2D-GBFRFT consistently surpasses
2D-GFRFT and enhances JFRFT. Experimental results confirmed the versatility and
superior performance of 2D-GBFRFT for filtering in GSP.

Abstract: Superimposed pilot (SIP) schemes face significant challenges in effectively
superimposing and separating pilot and data signals, especially in multiuser
mobility scenarios with rapidly varying channels. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel channel-aware learning framework for SIP schemes, termed
CaSIP, that jointly optimizes pilot-data power (PDP) allocation and a receiver
network for pilot-data interference (PDI) elimination, by leveraging channel
path gain information, a form of large-scale channel state information (CSI).
The proposed framework identifies user-specific, resource element-wise PDP
factors and develops a deep neural network-based SIP receiver comprising
explicit channel estimation and data detection components. To properly leverage
path gain data, we devise an embedding generator that projects it into
embeddings, which are then fused with intermediate feature maps of the channel
estimation network. Simulation results demonstrate that CaSIP efficiently
outperforms traditional pilot schemes and state-of-the-art SIP schemes in terms
of sum throughput and channel estimation accuracy, particularly under
high-mobility and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

Motivation: 当RSU发现某车辆需要执行规避动作时，由于不知道视频中的车辆对应哪个IP地址，无法向特定车辆发送警告信息。车辆身份与IP地址的匹配是一个基础性开放问题。

Method: 采用动态水印技术，要求车辆在转向角或油门/刹车控制命令中叠加小型随机激励信号，并将该随机波形连同IP地址发送给RSU。RSU通过视频流信号处理验证波形匹配，从而关联IP地址与视频中的车辆。

Conclusion: 动态水印技术能够有效解决车辆身份与IP地址的匹配问题，为智能交通系统中的车辆通信提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider a problem faced by an intelligent roadside unit (RSU) monitoring
a roadway by a video camera. Suppose the RSU notices that a particular car in
its visual field needs to execute a specific evasive maneuver to avoid danger.
It would like to send a packet addressed to that particular car with this
suggestion. The problem is that while all the cars are communicating with the
RSU, the RSU does not know which car in the video is associated with what IP
address. So, it does not know which IP address to send the packet to. Indeed,
the problem of matching addresses with cars in the visual field is a
fundamental open problem. We provide an active solution employing dynamic
watermarking that was originally developed for the security of cyber-physical
systems. This technique calls for a car to superpose a small random excitation
onto its actuation commands for steering angle or throttle/brake positions. The
car sends this random waveform to the RSU in a packet containing its IP
address. By signal processing of the video stream of a car at the RSU it can
verify whether it matches with the waveform in the packet and thereby
associates that the IP address of the packet with that car in the visual field.
The RSU thereby determines which IP address is associated with which car in its
visual field. We present two demonstrations of performance. We demonstrate
experimental results on a laboratory transportation automated vehicles, a
vision system, and a network, as well as on the field with two passenger sedans
in practice. The results demonstrate that employing the dynamic watermarking
method enables an RSU to distinguish the communication of a target vehicle from
that of other IP addresses of nearby vehicles.

Conclusion: CIRSense通过利用CIR的固有优势，显著提升了WiFi感知的性能和可解释性，在住宅空间、远距离和多目标场景中均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: WiFi sensing based on channel state information (CSI) collected from
commodity WiFi devices has shown great potential across a wide range of
applications, including vital sign monitoring and indoor localization. Existing
WiFi sensing approaches typically estimate motion information directly from
CSI. However, they often overlook the inherent advantages of channel impulse
response (CIR), a delay-domain representation that enables more intuitive and
principled motion sensing by naturally concentrating motion energy and
separating multipath components. Motivated by this, we revisit WiFi sensing and
introduce CIRSense, a new framework that enhances the performance and
interpretability of WiFi sensing with CIR. CIRSense is built upon a new motion
model that characterizes fractional delay effects, a fundamental challenge in
CIR-based sensing. This theoretical model underpins technical advances for the
three challenges in WiFi sensing: hardware distortion compensation,
high-resolution distance estimation, and subcarrier aggregation for extended
range sensing. CIRSense, operating with a 160 MHz channel bandwidth,
demonstrates versatile sensing capabilities through its dual-mode design,
achieving a mean error of approximately 0.25 bpm in respiration monitoring and
0.09 m in distance estimation. Comprehensive evaluations across residential
spaces, far-range scenarios, and multi-target settings demonstrate CIRSense's
superior performance over state-of-the-art CSI-based baselines. Notably, at a
challenging sensing distance of 20 m, CIRSense achieves at least 3x higher
average accuracy with more than 4.5x higher computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信号处理中通常假设数据符合高斯分布，但FIR滤波器等线性操作会产生加权和，改变了随机变量的分布特性，需要重新审视输出噪声的分布假设。

Method: 通过分析FIR输出不确定性与输入量化不确定性和滤波器系数的关系，并进行详细的数值模拟，研究输出不确定性分布。

Conclusion: 虽然FIR滤波器输出噪声不能简单假设为高斯分布，但高斯估计在某些应用场景下仍然具有实用价值，且输出不确定性分布可以通过主导系数进行估计。

Abstract: A common assumption in signal processing is that underlying data numerically
conforms to a Gaussian distribution. It is commonly utilized in signal
processing to describe unknown additive noise in a system and is often
justified by citing the central limit theorem for sums of random variables,
although the central limit theorem applies only to sums of independent
identically distributed random variables. However, many linear operations in
signal processing take the form of weighted sums, which transforms the random
variables such that their distributions are no longer identical. One such
operation is a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. FIR filters are commonly
used in signal processing applications as a pre-processing step. FIR output
noise is generally assumed to be Gaussian. This article examines the FIR output
response in the presence of uniformly distributed quantization noise. We
express the FIR output uncertainty in terms of the input quantization
uncertainty and filter coefficients. We show that the output uncertainty cannot
be assumed to be Gaussian, but depending on the application a Gaussian
estimation may still be useful. Then, we show through detailed numerical
simulations that the output uncertainty distribution of the filter can be
estimated through its most dominant coefficients.

into AI chips for effective thermal management. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, the
effects of High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) distributions and thermal interface
material configurations on heat dissipation and hotspot mitigation were
studied. A 20 {\deg}C reduction in hot spots was achieved using h-BN
interposers compared to Si interposers. Such an improvement could reduce AI
chips' power leakage by 22% and significantly enhance their thermal
performance.

Motivation: 分析多卫星系统中位置和姿态扰动对波束成形性能的影响，为开发控制感知的波束成形策略提供支持。

Method: 研究配备直接辐射阵列的小卫星编队系统，分析位置和姿态扰动对虚拟天线孔径合成的影响。

Conclusion: 支持开发紧密集成姿态轨道控制系统与信号处理的控制感知波束成形策略，实现鲁棒波束成形和自主协调。

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of position and attitude perturbations on
the beamforming performance of multi-satellite systems. The system under
analysis is a formation of small satellites equipped with direct radiating
arrays that synthesise a large virtual antenna aperture. The results show that
performance is highly sensitive to the considered perturbations. However, by
incorporating position and attitude information into the beamforming process,
nominal performance can be effectively restored. These findings support the
development of control-aware beamforming strategies that tightly integrate the
attitude and orbit control system with signal processing to enable robust
beamforming and autonomous coordination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无线通信和感知网络无法满足电子医疗对精确感知、高数据效率和隐私保护的严格要求，特别是在远程和隐私敏感环境中。

Method: 使用服务机器人通过雷达检测患者位置和生命体征，采用交互多模型(IMM)滤波器跟踪患者运动，并联合优化波束成形矩阵和语义提取比率以最大化语义保密率和感知精度。

Result: 仿真结果表明，ISCSC框架在感知精度、语义传输效率和隐私保护方面优于传统的联合感知和通信方法。

Conclusion: ISCSC框架能够有效满足现代医疗系统对实时生命体征监测和可靠通信的需求，同时确保数据隐私和临床相关性。

Abstract: Real-time and contactless monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and
heartbeat, alongside reliable communication, is essential for modern healthcare
systems, especially in remote and privacy-sensitive environments. Traditional
wireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the
stringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency,
and privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel
integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In
the proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions
and monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices.
Instead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and
communicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This
semantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical
relevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the
transmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the
robot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track
patient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and
reliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming
matrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and
power budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic
secrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC
framework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission
efficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint
sensing and communication methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于UatF下界的方法存在过于保守、缺乏尺度不变性等缺点，在极端情况下可能产生零速率边界，需要开发兼容更优信息论边界的框架。

Method: 开发了数学工具和定点算法框架，能够处理考虑解码器处完美或不完美CSI的替代边界，不依赖UatF下界。

Result: 提出的框架能够解决最大最小功率控制问题，兼容不遭受UatF边界缺点的信息论边界。

Conclusion: 新框架克服了UatF方法的局限性，为大规模MIMO系统提供了更优的功率控制解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce mathematical tools and fixed point algorithms for optimal
statistical max-min power control in cellular and cell-less massive MIMO
systems. Unlike previous studies that rely on the use-and-then-forget (UatF)
lower bound on Shannon achievable (ergodic) rates, our proposed framework can
deal with alternative bounds that explicitly consider perfect or imperfect
channel state information (CSI) at the decoder. In doing so, we address
limitations of UatF-based algorithms, which inherit the shortcomings of the
UatF bound. For example, the UatF bound can be overly conservative: in extreme
cases, under fully statistical (nonadaptive) beamforming in zero-mean channels,
the UatF bound produces trivial (zero) rate bounds. It also lacks scale
invariance: merely scaling the beamformers can change the bound drastically,
especially when simple beamforming strategies are employed. In contrast, our
framework is compatible with information-theoretic bounds that do not suffer
from the above drawbacks. We illustrate the framework by solving a max-min
power control problem considering a standard bound that exploits instantaneous
CSI at the decoder.

Motivation: 6G无线系统中精确信道估计对高速通信和高精度感知至关重要，但实际条件下相控阵天线的校准失配会严重影响性能。

Method: 将天线增益和相位偏差建模为潜变量，推导显式更新方程，联合推断校准参数和信道参数（模型阶数、复幅度、延迟、角度和噪声方差）。

Conclusion: 将自校准嵌入贝叶斯推理中显著增强了信道估计的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is essential for both high-rate communication and
high-precision sensing in 6G wireless systems. However, a major performance
limitation arises from calibration mismatches when operating phased-array
antennas under real-world conditions. To address this issue, we propose to
integrate antenna element self-calibration into a variational sparse Bayesian
learning (VSBL) algorithm for parametric channel estimation. We model antenna
gain and phase deviations as latent variables and derive explicit update
equations to jointly infer these calibration parameters and the channel
parameters: the model order, complex amplitudes, delays, angles, and the noise
variance. The resulting algorithm operates online and adapts in real time to
hardware-induced mismatches. We assess its performance in terms of the root
mean square error (RMSE) and the optimal subpattern-assignment (OSPA) metric,
demonstrating consistent improvements over conventional VSBL without
calibration. Our results demonstrate that embedding self-calibration within
Bayesian inference significantly enhances the robustness of channel estimation.

Abstract: The ever-growing demand for ultra-high data rates, massive connectivity, and
joint communication-sensing capabilities in future wireless networks is driving
research into sub-terahertz (sub-THz) communications. While these frequency
bands offer abundant spectrum, they also pose severe propagation and hardware
design challenges, motivating the search for alternative antenna solutions
beyond conventional antenna arrays. Leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) have emerged as
a promising candidate for sub-THz systems due to their simple feed structure,
low fabrication cost, and inherent angle-frequency coupling, which enables
frequency-controlled beamsteering with simple hardware. In this article, we
review the fundamentals of the LWA technology, highlight their unique
properties, and showcase their potential in multi-user wideband sub-THz
wireless communications. We present representative studies demonstrating that
LWAs can simultaneously support high-rate multi-user communications and
accurate localization using only a single antenna element. Finally, several key
open challenges are outlined, spanning algorithm design, signal processing,
information theory, standardization, and hardware implementation, that need to
be addressed to fully harness LWAs as a cost-effective and scalable enabler of
next generations of wireless systems.

Conclusion: DRGrad能有效管理多任务学习环境中的任务冲突，不增加模型复杂度，同时解决了噪声处理方面的不足。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a successful strategy in
industrial-scale recommender systems, offering significant advantages such as
capturing diverse users' interests and accurately detecting different behaviors
like ``click" or ``dwell time". However, negative transfer and the seesaw
phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often
contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the
problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a
personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of
three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad
judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all
valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the
efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset
with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance
over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area
Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts
in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while
also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on
the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the
capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with
varying degrees of correlation and personalization.

Method: 采用时空特征融合、频繁序列挖掘(FEM)用于交通模式发现，以及混合LSTM-Transformer模型进行交通状态预测。

Result: 在包含313,931个标注边界框的46个摄像头数据集上，实现了98.46%的预测准确率，宏精度0.9800，宏召回0.9839，宏F1分数0.9819。FEM分析发现置信度超过55%的显著序列模式，系统生成了46个持续拥堵警报。

Conclusion: 需要将视频流分析与多源数据相结合，设计实时、响应式、自适应的多级智能交通系统，使城市交通更智能安全。

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has intensified traffic congestion, environmental strain,
and inefficiencies in transportation systems, creating an urgent need for
intelligent and adaptive traffic management solutions. Conventional systems
relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic
nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework
that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to
enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology
incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for
sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for
robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2
dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It
achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of
0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis
revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions
with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts
are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion
management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream
analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time,
responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which
makes urban mobility smarter and safer.

Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is
crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material
engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are
computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or
real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic
materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations.
For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding
pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz
equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on
Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image
generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU
parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically
reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the
need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving.
Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time,
balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based
methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid
exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.

TL;DR: GradFix是一种无需额外微调的任务向量迁移方法，通过分析目标模型的梯度符号结构来调整源任务向量，实现跨预训练模型的知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当新版本基础模型发布时，传统方法需要重新进行完整微调，即使任务相同。任务向量迁移因参数空间不对齐而失败，需要解决跨模型知识重用问题。

Method: 通过少量标注样本计算目标模型梯度，分析其符号结构，据此掩码源任务向量，生成与目标损失景观局部对齐的更新向量。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中显著优于朴素任务向量相加和少样本微调方法，理论保证了一阶下降特性。

Conclusion: GradFix通过梯度符号结构分析实现了高效的任务向量迁移，为跨模型知识重用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 点集神经网络能有效处理NOvA实验的稀疏2D数据，在减少内存消耗的同时提高性能。

Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino
particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can
be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source
particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has
commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector,
the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the
detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural
network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes
information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory
required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher
score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).

Method: 引入各向异性噪声算子，用结构化的频率对角协方差替换各向同性前向协方差。该算子统一了带通掩码和幂律加权，允许强调或抑制特定频带，同时保持前向过程的高斯性。

Conclusion: 精心设计的各向异性前向噪声为在DPMs中定制归纳偏置提供了一个简单而有原则的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电化学阻抗谱数据使用等效电路模型进行拟合时，损失函数的选择对收敛性、计算效率和拟合质量有重要影响，特别是在大规模数据驱动应用中需要更高效的拟合方法。

Method: 使用生成的大规模EIS数据集，比较了提出的log-B和log-BW损失函数与现有损失函数在R2分数、卡方值、计算效率和MAPE等方面的性能。

Result: X2损失函数在多个拟合质量指标上表现最佳，而log-B损失函数虽然拟合质量略低，但计算速度快约1.4倍，且对大多数电路组件产生更低的MAPE。

Conclusion: 当拟合质量是首要目标时，X2损失函数是最佳选择；对于需要计算效率的大规模最小二乘拟合应用，log-B是一个强有力的替代方案。

Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using
an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a
loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two
new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of
EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed
loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores,
chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values.
Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts
convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis
showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional
weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit
metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary
goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while
being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit
components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for
large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training
machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.

Conclusion: SODA方法通过语义凝聚知识蒸馏方案有效解决了跨模态哈希中的语义兼容性问题，显著提升了性能

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

disaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be
realized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM
inference engines and queries.
  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV
caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM
engines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.
LMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming
LLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV
cache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both
cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode
disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and
wide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache
data movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement
operations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,
decoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class
control API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for
flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.
Evaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x
improvement in throughput across diverse workloads. With a growing community,
LMCache has seen dramatic growth in adoption by enterprise inference systems,
which provides valuable lessons for future KV caching solutions. The source

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying wildfire risks globally, making reliable
forecasting critical for adaptation strategies. While machine learning shows
promise for wildfire prediction from Earth observation data, current approaches
lack uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision making. We
present the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread
forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. We demonstrate that
predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near
fire perimeters. Our novel distance metric reveals high-uncertainty regions
form consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines - directly
applicable for emergency planning. Feature attribution identifies vegetation
health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers. This work enables more
robust wildfire management systems supporting communities adapting to
increasing fire risk under climate change.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse
events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the
same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such
knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this
study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern
machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach
combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures
fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual
chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score
(RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction
labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel
three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global
exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive
accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a
clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance,
studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute
to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical
pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient
models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成具有精细空间分辨率的合成人口数据，为需要详细地理信息的应用打开了大门，如洪水响应、流行病传播、疏散规划和交通建模等。

Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit
coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods
exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from
other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven
densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that
first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using
Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach
also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features,
exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating
synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121
datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an
evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility,
while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE
architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and
uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated
synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications
requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic
spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.

Method: 改进PARCv2（物理感知循环卷积神经网络）架构，使其能够快速预测剪切局部化和塑性加热，并与傅里叶神经算子和神经常微分方程等模型进行基准测试。

Result: PARCv2在捕捉剪切带形成的时空动力学方面表现优于其他物理信息模型，但所有模型都存在一定的失效模式。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在开发反应性材料的AI加速模拟工具时，领域特定考虑因素的重要性。

Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires
capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in
microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts.
These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate
chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the
formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock
loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling
of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock
conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct
numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional
Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting
strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to
rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important
roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two
widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural
ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in
capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models
exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of
domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation
tools for reactive materials.

Method: 引入测量空间的正向随机过程，与数据空间扩散并行演化，推导出封闭形式的后验分布进行递归采样

Result: C-DPS在多个逆问题基准测试中，在质量和数量上均优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: C-DPS框架通过耦合扩散过程提供了一种准确稳定的逆问题解决方案

Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy
or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging,
remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently
emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods
either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency
through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y}
\mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under
complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion
posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or
likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the
measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the
data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a
closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive
sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results
demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态特征排除策略无法有效防止偏见，因为隐藏依赖关系会影响模型预测。需要动态平衡泛化能力、准确性和公平性。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，智能体根据集成预测性能和公平性考虑的自适应奖励信号来选择特征子集，并与集成学习相结合。

Result: 该方法能够动态平衡模型的泛化能力、准确性和公平性，避免偏见在相关预测因子中无意中重新出现。

Conclusion: 该强化学习框架提供了一种灵活通用的特征选择方法，特别适用于预测因子相关且偏见可能重新出现的环境。

Abstract: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias when hidden
dependencies influence the model predictions. To address this issue, we explore
a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates bias mitigation and
automated feature selection within a single learning process. Unlike
traditional heuristic-driven filter or wrapper approaches, our RL agent
adaptively selects features using a reward signal that explicitly integrates
predictive performance with fairness considerations. This dynamic formulation
allows the model to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the
training process, rather than rely exclusively on pre-processing adjustments or
post hoc correction mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the construction of
a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agents action space
over feature subsets, and the integration of this system with ensemble
learning. We aim to provide a flexible and generalizable way to select features
in environments where predictors are correlated and biases can inadvertently
re-emerge.

Motivation: 解决高维混杂变量下因果估计的维度诅咒问题，利用LLM的历史知识和推理能力提升条件期望函数估计器的性能。

Method: 在双机器学习框架中，将LLM生成的预测作为预测变量纳入模型，而不是仅仅使用从这些模型中提取的嵌入。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的AI工具可以有效地改进因果估计，通过利用其历史知识和推理能力来克服因果推断中的维度问题。

Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective use of LLM-powered AI tools to improve
causal estimation. In double machine learning, the accuracy of causal estimates
of the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of a
high-dimensional confounder depends on the performance of estimators of
conditional expectation functions. We show that predictions made by generative
models trained on historical data can be used to improve the performance of
these estimators relative to approaches that solely rely on adjusting for
embeddings extracted from these models. We argue that the historical knowledge
and reasoning capacities associated with these generative models can help
overcome curse-of-dimensionality problems in causal inference problems. We
consider a case study using a small dataset of online jewelry auctions, and
demonstrate that inclusion of LLM-generated guesses as predictors can improve
efficiency in estimation.

Abstract: Fingerprinting Radio Frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding
unique emitter characteristics that are featured in their transmitted signals.
These fingerprints are nuanced but sufficiently detailed, motivating the
pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The most granular
downstream task is known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), which
requires a well informed RF fingerprinting (RFF) approach for it to be
successful. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous application areas in
defence and civilian contexts such as signal intelligence, electronic
surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless communication devices,
to name a few. RFF methods also support many other downstream tasks such as
Emitter Data Association (EDA) and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC) and are
applicable to a range of transmission types. In recent years, data-driven
approaches have become popular in the RFF domain due to their ability to
automatically learn intricate fingerprints from raw data. These methods
generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional techniques.
The more traditional approaches are often labour-intensive, inflexible and only
applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. Therefore, we
consider data-driven Machine Learning (ML)-enabled RFF. In particular, we
propose a generic framework for ML-enabled RFF which is inclusive of several
popular downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA and RFEC. Each task is formulated as
a RF fingerprint-dependent task. A variety of use cases using real RF datasets
are presented here to demonstrate the framework for a range of tasks and
application areas, such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and
countering drones.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer
vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing
these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges
related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To
address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential
equations perspective to propose a unified theoretical framework and systematic
design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an
extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling
methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural
network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and
stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to
illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising
research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to
offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast
enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在时间序列预测中应用广泛，但实证显示Transformer往往无法超越简单线性模型。缺乏对这一现象的理论理解促使作者从上下文学习理论角度分析Transformer的局限性。

Method: 使用理论分析方法，在AR(p)数据假设下，通过上下文学习理论框架分析线性自注意力模型的性能边界，并进行实验验证。

Result: 理论证明：(1)线性自注意力模型在上下文预测中无法获得比经典线性模型更低的期望MSE；(2)当上下文长度趋近无穷时，LSA渐近恢复最优线性预测器；(3)在思维链推理下，预测会指数级坍缩到均值。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer在时间序列预测中的根本理论限制，建议研究社区重新审视TSF的基本理论边界，并批判性评估复杂架构的直接应用。

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved
problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer
architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful
Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models,
on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon
remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL)
theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear
Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than
classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length
approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear
predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions
collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings
through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on
several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights
for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work
encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental
theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct
application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper
scrutiny.

Conclusion: 研究不仅影响神经网络训练实践，还在关键学习期和热启动神经网络训练研究之间建立了重要联系，为改进训练方法提供了实用方案。

Abstract: This study delves into the plasticity of neural networks, offering empirical
support for the notion that critical learning periods and warm-starting
performance loss can be avoided through simple adjustments to learning
hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is
initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the
network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy
with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training
follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical
learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope
of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a
warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit
pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted
by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact
neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between
critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network
training.

Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing
imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority
samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require
converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to
information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been
introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches
typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness
and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap,
we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity.
First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample
generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new
permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the
LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further
enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated
synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our
method encourages diversity in the generated samples.

Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护了数据隐私，但传统的固定隐私预算差分隐私方法在模型收敛时会引入过多噪声，损害模型性能。因此需要研究自适应隐私预算方法来平衡隐私保护与模型准确性。

Conclusion: 自适应隐私预算和自适应裁剪是有效的联邦学习隐私保护方法，能够在保护敏感数据的同时减少性能损失，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients
without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still
remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by
adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget.
However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the
model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem,
adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This
work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an
adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an
adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients
of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We
conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID
datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our
experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that
adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy
while preserving privacy.

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of
gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the
gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as
vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and
an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training
methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem
into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the
constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms.
This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted
training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel
Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse
architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and
Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from
convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates
distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations,
and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the
implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies,
including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive
optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods.
Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems,
detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g.,
unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks.
Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and
stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training,
particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.

*Jiakang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对三种无网格神经PDE求解器(PINNs、DRM、WANs)进行了统一比较，在泊松问题和薛定谔方程上测试，并扩展到激光驱动情况。所有方法在强制边界条件和正交正则化下都能达到低误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏微分方程在科学和工程中广泛应用，但解析解不常见，传统网格求解器在高维情况下成本高昂。需要评估无网格神经求解器的性能和适用性。

Method: 使用统一协议比较三种方法：物理信息神经网络(PINNs)、深度Ritz方法(DRM)和弱对抗网络(WANs)。测试问题包括泊松问题(最高5D)和薛定谔方程(1D/2D)，并扩展到Kramers-Henneberger变换的激光驱动情况。

Result: 所有方法在强制边界条件和正交正则化下都能达到10^-6到10^-9的低L2误差。PINNs在精度和激发谱恢复方面最可靠；DRM在稳态问题上提供最佳精度-运行时间权衡；WAN更敏感但在弱形式约束下具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 物理引导的神经求解器是解决复杂PDE的可信、可扩展工具。提供了方法选择实用指南，并提出了时间相关公式、自适应采样、并行多状态训练等扩展方向。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and
engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based
solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified
comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks
(WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schr\"odinger
equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the
study to a laser-driven case of Schr\"odinger's equation via the
Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation.
  Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors
($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs),
forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs
are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers
the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more
sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used
effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning,
network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most
gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case,
indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks.
  We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the
following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive
residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain
decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible,
scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文系统探索了神经网络中梯度下降方法的规范选择，提出了新的MuonMax优化器变体，并展示了与Momo动量方法结合后能显著提高超参数鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在神经网络中定义最速下降方法，需要为每层选择规范、跨层聚合规范的方式以及是否使用归一化。现有方法如Adam和Muon在超参数敏感性方面存在不足。

Method: 系统探索跨层规范聚合的不同替代方案，将Adam和Muon形式化为非欧几里得梯度下降类型，推导Muon优化器的新变体，并与模型动量(Momo)方法结合。

Result: Muon对学习率选择敏感，而新变体MuonMax显著更鲁棒。与Momo结合的Muon变体在超参数调优方面更鲁棒，通常获得更好的验证分数。

Conclusion: 对于新任务，当最优超参数未知时，建议使用Momo与MuonMax组合，以节省昂贵的超参数调优成本。

Abstract: To define a steepest descent method over a neural network, we need to choose
a norm for each layer, a way to aggregate these norms across layers, and
whether to use normalization. We systematically explore different alternatives
for aggregating norms across layers, both formalizing existing combinations of
Adam and the recently proposed Muon as a type of non-Euclidean gradient
descent, and deriving new variants of the Muon optimizer. Through a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the optimizers within our framework,
we find that Muon is sensitive to the choice of learning rate, whereas a new
variant we call MuonMax is significantly more robust. We then show how to
combine any non-Euclidean gradient method with model based momentum (known as
Momo). The new Momo variants of Muon are significantly more robust to
hyperparameter tuning, and often achieve a better validation score. Thus for
new tasks, where the optimal hyperparameters are not known, we advocate for
using Momo in combination with MuonMax to save on costly hyperparameter tuning.

TL;DR: Kelp是一个新颖的流式风险检测插件框架，通过建模LM生成过程中隐藏状态的时序演化，实现实时风险检测，比现有后处理防护方法更准确高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防护方法多为后处理检测，可能在检测前就暴露不安全内容，且延迟限制迫使其使用轻量模型，限制了检测准确性。

Method: 提出Kelp框架，利用Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD)建模风险在生成序列中的时序演化，并引入Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC)损失来确保单调的危害预测。

Result: 在各种模型和数据集上，Kelp始终优于最先进的后处理防护方法和现有插件探针（平均F1提高15.61%），仅使用20M参数且每token延迟增加不到0.5毫秒。

Conclusion: Kelp通过流式风险检测有效解决了现有防护方法的局限性，在保持低延迟的同时显著提高了检测准确性。

Abstract: Large models (LMs) are powerful content generators, yet their open-ended
nature can also introduce potential risks, such as generating harmful or biased
content. Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose
unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push
them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we
propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection
within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states
through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal
evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time
risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications,
we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic
harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides,
for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present
StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from
each protected model, reflecting real-world streaming scenarios in both text
and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in
probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding
less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.

Result: 实验表明ParBaLS EPIG在固定预算和贝叶斯逻辑回归神经网络嵌入上，在多个数据集上提供了优越的性能。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯决策理论为主动学习提供了统一框架，ParBaLS EPIG是有效的批量主动学习方法。

Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions
have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to
use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide
decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in
the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label.
This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction
(EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that
appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based
on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic
approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to
large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or
dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular
formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling
(ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets
that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian
Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at

TL;DR: VCON是一种平滑过渡压缩方法，通过在微调期间并行运行原始模型和压缩模型，逐步减少原始模型贡献并增加压缩模型贡献，从而减轻精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络规模不断扩大，需要压缩技术来减少内存、计算和能耗，但直接应用这些方法会导致严重的精度下降。

Method: VCON方法在微调期间并行执行原始模型和压缩模型，逐步减少原始模型的贡献比例，同时增加压缩模型的贡献比例，实现平滑过渡。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，结合多种压缩策略，VCON带来了一致的改进：典型增益超过3%，某些配置的精度提升达到20%。

Conclusion: VCON为现有压缩技术提供了一种通用方法，在多个基准测试中显示出一致的性能提升。

Abstract: The increasing scale of deep neural networks has led to a growing need for
compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and low-rank
decomposition. While these methods are very effective in reducing memory,
computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy
degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON),
a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed
form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed
version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution
of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of
the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the
network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy
degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language
processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies.
Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains
exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus
provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression
techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了重尾噪声下的鲁棒非参数回归，使用Huber回归作为示例，提出了基于预测误差而非泛化误差的学习性能评估方法，并建立了新的比较定理和有限样本误差界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒学习的泛化误差界不能准确反映样本外性能，且在无界函数空间和重尾噪声下，标准浓度工具失效，需要新的分析框架。

Method: 采用Tikhonov正则化风险最小化在再生核希尔伯特空间中，引入概率有效假设空间，建立鲁棒风险与L2预测误差的比较定理，分析稳健性-偏差权衡。

Result: 建立了新的比较定理，将超额鲁棒风险与L2预测误差联系起来，残余项为O(σ^{-2ε})，推导了无一致有界性和重尾噪声下的显式有限样本误差界和收敛速率。

Conclusion: 预测误差而非超额泛化风险是分析鲁棒学习的基本视角，研究提供了原则性的调参规则，并适用于Huber以外的其他鲁棒损失函数。

Abstract: We investigate robust nonparametric regression in the presence of
heavy-tailed noise, where the hypothesis class may contain unbounded functions
and robustness is ensured via a robust loss function $\ell_\sigma$. Using Huber
regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges:
(i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment
assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded
hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional
generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture
out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be
quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth
$f^\star$, which is $\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of
robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a
\emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator
with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition
under weak $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new
comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction
error up to a residual of order $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-2\epsilon})$, clarifying
the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\sigma$.
Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence
rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and
under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends
beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not
excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust
learning.

Conclusion: 这项工作通过基准测试算子学习方法来建模物理系统，解决了可再生能源集成和气候变化缓解中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Time domain simulation, i.e., modeling the system's evolution over time, is a
crucial tool for studying and enhancing power system stability and dynamic
performance. However, these simulations become computationally intractable for
renewable-penetrated grids, due to the small simulation time step required to
capture renewable energy resources' ultra-fast dynamic phenomena in the range
of 1-50 microseconds. This creates a critical need for solutions that are both
fast and scalable, posing a major barrier for the stable integration of
renewable energy resources and thus climate change mitigation. This paper
explores operator learning, a family of machine learning methods that learn
mappings between functions, as a surrogate model for these costly simulations.
The paper investigates, for the first time, the fundamental concept of
simulation time step-invariance, which enables models trained on coarse time
steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning
methods are benchmarked on a simple test system that, while not incorporating
practical complexities of renewable-penetrated grids, serves as a first
proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of time step-invariance. Models
are evaluated on (i) zero-shot super-resolution, where training is performed on
a coarse simulation time step and inference is performed at super-resolution,
and (ii) generalization between stable and unstable dynamic regimes. This work
addresses a key challenge in the integration of renewable energy for the
mitigation of climate change by benchmarking operator learning methods to model
physical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的北极海冰浓度季节性预测系统存在系统性偏差和复杂的时空误差，传统的一对一后处理方法无法充分量化不确定性，而决策制定需要适当的概率信息特别是极端事件的概率。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器模型来映射观测数据在给定有偏差模型预测条件下的分布，这种方法能够自然生成大量调整后的预测集合。

Result: 调整后的预测在校准性、与观测分布的接近程度以及误差大小方面都优于基于气候平均调整的预测。

Conclusion: 基于条件变分自编码器的概率误差校正框架能够有效改进北极海冰浓度的季节性预测，提供更好的不确定性量化和校准性能。

Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the
negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline
of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often
show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the
forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected
and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice
concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing
methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more
recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best
to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast.
However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and
likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic
error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model
to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model
prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of
adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic
metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to
the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological
mean adjusted forecasts.

Motivation: 现有方法无法显式建模临床变量之间随时间传播的影响关系，要么依赖黑盒机制，要么使用简单聚合，缺乏对特征交互传播路径的透明解释。

Method: 使用多层注意力架构：时间注意力层识别患者记录中的关键时间点，跨特征注意力层建模这些时间点特征对后续特征的定向影响，构建显式的时间展开影响图。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集和慢性肾病队列上的死亡率和疾病进展任务中，CoI在预测准确性上显著优于现有方法，并能揭示具有临床意义的患者特异性疾病进展模式。

Conclusion: CoI框架不仅提高了预测性能，更重要的是提供了前所未有的透明度，能够追踪任何特征在任何时间点对最终预测的直接和间接影响路径，为临床决策提供可解释的洞察。

Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing
latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches
often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly
model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over
time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep
learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature
interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a
temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record;
second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from
features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the
tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how
any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and
through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and
disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic
kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods
in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that
CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease
progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented
transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform
clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: 提出的群体自适应对抗训练策略有效提升了假新闻检测模型对对抗性评论攻击的防御能力，同时保持了良好的检测性能。

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in
social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models
perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly
shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive
evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then
introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the
robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:
(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded
categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,
category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)
applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting
Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment
categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing
robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

Motivation: 梯度下降等优化方法的性能高度依赖学习率的选择，但手动调整学习率需要大量用户调参工作，特别是在作为其他算法内循环时，期望用户调参是不现实的。

Method: 提出了AutoGD方法，该方法在每次迭代时自动决定是增加还是减少学习率，无需知道平滑度常数，并扩展到AutoBFGS和AutoLBFGS。

Result: 实验证明AutoGD在传统问题和变分推断优化任务中表现优异，能够恢复GD的最优收敛速率（最多相差一个常数）。

Conclusion: AutoGD提供了一种自动调整学习率的有效方法，解决了梯度下降方法中学习率调参的难题，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: The performance of gradient-based optimization methods, such as standard
gradient descent (GD), greatly depends on the choice of learning rate. However,
it can require a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort to select an
appropriate learning rate schedule. When such methods appear as inner loops of
other algorithms, expecting the user to tune the learning rates may be
impractical. To address this, we introduce AutoGD: a gradient descent method
that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate
at a given iteration. We establish the convergence of AutoGD, and show that we
can recover the optimal rate of GD (up to a constant) for a broad class of
functions without knowledge of smoothness constants. Experiments on a variety
of traditional problems and variational inference optimization tasks
demonstrate strong performance of the method, along with its extensions to
AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.

Motivation: 现有方法将训练数据识别视为简单的二元分类任务，缺乏统计保证。最近的方法虽然设计用于控制FDR，但其保证依赖于容易被违反的强假设。

Method: 使用已知未见数据为每个数据点计算p值，构建测试集数据使用比例的保守估计器来缩放这些p值，然后通过识别缩放后p值低于数据相关阈值的数据点来选择最终训练数据集。

Result: 在广泛的模型(LLMs和VLMs)和数据集上的实验表明，PTDI严格控制了FDR并实现了更高的检测能力。

Conclusion: PTDI提供了一种严格的训练数据识别方法，具有可证明的FDR控制和显著提升的检测能力，适用于版权诉讼、隐私审计和公平评估等场景。

Abstract: Identifying training data within large-scale models is critical for copyright
litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. The conventional
approaches treat it as a simple binary classification task without statistical
guarantees. A recent approach is designed to control the false discovery rate
(FDR), but its guarantees rely on strong, easily violated assumptions. In this
paper, we introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a rigorous
method that identifies a set of training data with strict false discovery rate
(FDR) control. Specifically, our method computes p-values for each data point
using a set of known unseen data, and then constructs a conservative estimator
for the data usage proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these
p-values. Our approach then selects the final set of training data by
identifying all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent
threshold. This entire procedure enables the discovery of training data with
provable, strict FDR control and significantly boosted power. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of models (LLMs and VLMs), and datasets
demonstrate that PTDI strictly controls the FDR and achieves higher power.

Motivation: 传统不完全多视图谱聚类方法需要在特征提取后执行K-means算法生成聚类结果，且未能有效利用样本间的连通性信息。

Method: CRG_IMSC通过对提取特征施加非负约束直接获得聚类结果，根据谱聚类结果构建连通性矩阵，并基于该矩阵最小化自表示残差。使用乘法更新迭代算法求解优化问题。

Conclusion: CRG_IMSC方法有效解决了传统不完全多视图谱聚类的缺陷，通过直接获得聚类结果和利用连通性信息，提高了聚类性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view spectral clustering generalizes spectral clustering to
multi-view data and simultaneously realizes the partition of multi-view data
with missing views. For this category of method, K-means algorithm needs to be
performed to generate the clustering result after the procedure of feature
extraction. More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the
clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we
propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering
(CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing
nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the
connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and
minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix.
A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve
the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously.
On benchmark datasets, for multi-view data, CRG_IMSC performs better than
state-of-the-art clustering methods, and the experimental results also
demonstrate the convergence of CRG_IMSC algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦聚类问题，使互联设备能够在不共享本地数据集的情况下，基于k-means原则进行联合硬聚类。

Method: 将联邦k-means聚类表述为GTVMin问题，每个设备通过求解修改后的本地k-means问题来更新本地聚类中心，修改包括添加惩罚项来衡量相邻设备聚类中心的差异。

Result: 开发出隐私友好的联邦k-means算法，仅需要在互联设备间共享聚合信息。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了联邦环境下的k-means聚类，保护了数据隐私，同时保持了聚类性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated clustering, where interconnected devices
have access to private local datasets and need to jointly cluster the overall
dataset without sharing their local dataset. Our focus is on hard clustering
based on the k-means principle. We formulate federated k-means clustering as an
instance of GTVMin. This formulation naturally lends to a federated k-means
algorithm where each device updates local cluster centroids by solving a
modified local k-means problem. The modification involves adding a penalty term
to measure the discrepancy between the cluster centroid of neighbouring
devices. Our federated k-means algorithm is privacy-friendly as it only
requires sharing aggregated information among interconnected devices.

Conclusion: 该框架在状态聚合中实现了计算效率与性能保证的平衡，同态策略梯度算法在满足充分条件时能保证最优策略等价性。

Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the
original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the
aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the
ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of
homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value
functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we
establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and
derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound
for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy
Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient
conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances
computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In
the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative
evaluations against seven algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用上下文向量表示模型能力的新型路由方法，通过两阶段训练实现高效模型路由，支持新模型的无缝集成而无需重新训练路由器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型路由方法依赖准确的模型表示，添加新模型通常需要重新训练，限制了可扩展性。需要一种能够动态选择最适合模型且易于扩展的路由方法。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）查询嵌入和投影到向量空间，训练投影器和基于LLM的路由器来重建原始查询；2）基于查询和模型性能的上下文向量，路由器学习预测每个模型是否能正确回答新查询。

Result: 在分布内和分布外任务中都实现了最先进的路由性能，同时支持新模型的无缝集成而无需重新训练路由器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过上下文向量有效表示模型能力，显著提升了模型路由的性能和可扩展性，为动态模型选择提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model
routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the
most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance
relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically
requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model
capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded
and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to
reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the
router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query
set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model
performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.
Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without
retraining the router. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种基于精确Lipschitz证书的Wasserstein分布鲁棒优化方法，通过原始方法和新型Wasserstein分布攻击来收紧上界，在ReLU网络上实现精确可处理的WDRO问题表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于全局Lipschitz连续性或强对偶性的WDRO方法存在上界松弛或计算复杂的问题，需要更紧的上界和更灵活的攻击方法。

Method: 采用原始方法引入精确Lipschitz证书，提出Wasserstein分布攻击直接构造最坏分布，利用ReLU网络在激活单元上的分段仿射结构。

Result: 在广泛评估中，该方法实现了与最先进基线相当的鲁棒精度，同时提供比现有方法更紧的证书。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在Wasserstein分布鲁棒优化中提供了更紧的上界和更灵活的攻击能力，在ReLU网络上实现了精确可处理的表征。

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework
for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz
continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require
prohibitive computation. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz
certificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a
novel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a
candidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise
attack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and
location of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine
structure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in
an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust
accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates
than existing methods. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Narrative Learning方法在大多数数据集上表现优于传统可解释机器学习模型，表明基于自然语言的模型定义和迭代改进具有潜力，特别是在语言模型持续改进的背景下。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Narrative Learning, a methodology where models
are defined entirely in natural language and iteratively refine their
classification criteria using explanatory prompts rather than traditional
numerical optimisation. We report on experiments to evaluate the accuracy and
potential of this approach using 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets and compare
them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate
that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate
than the baseline explainable models in 2025 or earlier because of improvements
in language models. We also report on trends in the lexicostatistics of these
models' outputs as a proxy for the comprehensibility of the explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要大量环境交互样本，但在复杂环境中这会带来高昂计算成本。PPOPT旨在通过预训练提高训练效率，减少环境交互需求。

Method: 采用新型策略神经网络架构，包含预训练的神经网络中间层和两个全连接网络。在具有相似物理特性的不同环境中预训练部分网络，以利用可转移的物理特性理解。

Result: PPOPT在小训练样本上优于经典PPO，在奖励获取和训练稳定性方面表现更好。虽然不如DYNA DDPG等基于模型的方法，但无模型特性使其训练时间显著减少。

Conclusion: PPOPT通过预训练策略实现了高效的强化学习，特别适合计算资源受限的场景，并已开源实现。

Abstract: We introduce PPOPT - Proximal Policy Optimization using Pretraining, a novel,
model-free deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm that leverages pretraining to
achieve high training efficiency and stability on very small training samples
in physics-based environments. Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on
large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent
interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high
computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main
innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a
pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected
networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with
similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high
efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the
transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We
demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training
samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While
PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the
model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than
its model-based counterparts. Finally, we present our implementation of PPOPT
as open-source software, available at github.com/Davidrxyang/PPOPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从大型行为抽象（如直接跟随图或Petri网）生成解释计算成本高，需要探索在资源受限环境下更高效的LLM辅助过程分析方法。

Method: 建立流水线：(i)从固定日志的逐步缩小前缀中发现模型，(ii)使用LLM生成解释，(iii)使用第二个LLM评估解释的完整性、瓶颈识别和建议改进。

Result: 在合成日志上，适度减少输入时解释质量基本保持，表明存在实用的成本-质量权衡。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限环境下更高效的计算LLM辅助过程分析提供了可行路径，但需注意评估基于LLM评分且数据为合成的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate textual
explanations of process models discovered from event logs. Producing
explanations from large behavioral abstractions (e.g., directly-follows graphs
or Petri nets) can be computationally expensive. This paper reports an
exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive
behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively
smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple
input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a
second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested
improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under
moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is
exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than
ground truth) and the data are synthetic. The results suggest a path toward
more computationally efficient, LLM-assisted process analysis in
resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环注意力机制在复杂推理任务中优于标准注意力机制，但其理论优势尚未得到充分探索，需要从损失景观几何角度解释这一现象。

Method: 扩展River-Valley景观模型，区分U形谷和V形谷，基于经验观察提出循环注意力架构诱导River-V-Valley景观偏置的理论，并开发SHIFT分层渐进训练框架。

Result: 理论推导表明循环注意力的景观偏置能保证更好的损失收敛和复杂模式学习，SHIFT框架能加速训练过程同时保持可比性能。

Conclusion: 循环注意力通过诱导V形谷景观偏置在复杂推理任务中表现更优，SHIFT框架有效加速其训练过程。

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard
transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the
theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we
explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired
by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian
levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by
distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep).
Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture
of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley.
Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss
convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage
learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by
Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical
Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that
accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable
performances.

TL;DR: ARROW提出了一种自适应滚动多尺度时间路由方法，用于解决现有天气预测方法在建模时空依赖性和平衡误差累积方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的天气预测方法通常建模固定短时间间隔的大气动力学，依赖朴素自回归进行长期预测，但存在两个关键局限：无法充分建模全球天气系统的空间和多尺度时间依赖性，以及滚动策略难以平衡误差累积与精细大气变化捕捉。

Method: 构建多间隔预测模型，使用共享-私有专家混合机制捕捉不同时间尺度的共享模式和特定特征，采用环形位置编码准确表示地球的纬度结构。开发基于强化学习的自适应滚动调度器，根据当前天气状态选择最适合的时间间隔进行预测。

Result: 实验结果表明ARROW在全球天气预测中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ARROW为全球天气预测领域建立了一个有前景的范式。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental task in spatiotemporal data analysis,
with broad applications across a wide range of domains. Existing data-driven
forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short
time interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout
for long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers
from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and
multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)
the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture
of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an
Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather
Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a
multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time
intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures
both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics
across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes
the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial
information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout
scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time
interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental
results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global
weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.

Motivation: 研究深度学习天气预报模型对对抗攻击的脆弱性，特别是上游天气预报的微小扰动如何改变下游台风轨迹预测，而现有方法在可靠生成攻击者指定轨迹方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出Cyc-Attack方法：预训练可微分代理模型近似台风检测器输出；使用偏斜感知损失函数和核膨胀策略解决类别不平衡；采用距离梯度加权和正则化确保扰动物理一致性。

Result: Cyc-Attack能够有效生成对抗性台风轨迹，成功操纵下游预测结果，同时保持生成的对抗预报具有物理合理性且不易被检测。

Conclusion: Cyc-Attack方法证明了深度学习天气预报模型对对抗攻击的脆弱性，为提升此类系统的安全性和鲁棒性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather
observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of
downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In
this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where
subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream
TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF
models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that
reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains
a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,
non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks
infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class
imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that
will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining
physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another
significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a
novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate
adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model
to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of
gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function
with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a
distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to
constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the
adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业间关系识别对金融分析和公司治理至关重要，但面临数据规模大、稀疏性和上下文依赖等挑战。现有方法如图方法缺乏语义深度，而LLM难以表示关系依赖。

Method: 提出跨模态框架InterCorpRel-LLM，整合GNN和LLM，使用FactSet供应链记录构建专有数据集，设计三个训练任务：公司图匹配、行业分类和供应关系预测。

Result: 在供应关系识别任务上，仅使用7B参数骨干网络和轻量训练，F-score达到0.8543，显著优于GPT-5的0.2287。模型还能零样本泛化到竞争者识别任务。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效捕捉企业间复杂动态关系，为分析师和战略制定者提供强大工具，增强动态市场中的决策和风险管理能力。

Abstract: Identifying inter-firm relationships such as supply and competitive ties is
critical for financial analysis and corporate governance, yet remains
challenging due to the scale, sparsity, and contextual dependence of corporate
data. Graph-based methods capture structure but miss semantic depth, while
large language models (LLMs) excel at text but remain limited in their ability
to represent relational dependencies. To address this, we propose
InterCorpRel-LLM, a cross-modal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs,
supported by a proprietary dataset derived from FactSet supply chain records
and three tailored training tasks: company graph matching, industry
classification, and supply relation prediction. This design enables effective
joint modeling of structure and semantics. Experiments show that
InterCorpRel-LLM substantially outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-5,
on a supply relation identification task, achieving an F-score of 0.8543 vs.
0.2287 with only a 7B-parameter backbone and lightweight training. The model
also generalizes to zero-shot competitor identification, underscoring its
ability to capture nuanced inter-firm dynamics. Our framework thus provides
analysts and strategists with a robust tool for mapping and reasoning about
complex corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in
dynamic markets.

Conclusion: 探索无关分配是多组均值估计的原则性和高效方法，在实验设计、个性化等需要准确多组推断的领域有应用潜力。

Abstract: We address the problem of multi-group mean estimation, which seeks to
allocate a finite sampling budget across multiple groups to obtain uniformly
accurate estimates of their means. Unlike classical multi-armed bandits, whose
objective is to minimize regret by identifying and exploiting the best arm, the
optimal allocation in this setting requires sampling every group on the order
of $\Theta(T)$ times. This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free
algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions.
First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration
using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian
distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free
non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds
than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit
settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side
information with provable guarantees. Overall, these results position
exploration-free allocation as a principled and efficient approach to
multi-group mean estimation, with potential applications in experimental
design, personalization, and other domains requiring accurate multi-group
inference.

Motivation: 验证词汇假说，探索机器学习能否替代传统人格心理学模型，检查Big Five模型的生态效度。

Method: 从经典形容词列表使用机器学习构建人格模型，与Big Five模型对比分析100万条Reddit评论。

Result: Big Five模型（特别是宜人性、尽责性和神经质）在描述在线社区方面更强大且可解释，机器学习聚类未能提供有意义的区分，未能恢复外向性特质，缺乏Big Five的心理测量一致性。

Conclusion: Big Five模型具有稳健性，人格的语义结构是情境依赖的，机器学习可以检查现有心理学理论的生态效度，但可能无法替代它们。

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language
and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up
personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and
compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million
Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of
these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided
no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and
lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the
robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is
context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check
the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be
able to replace them.

Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement
learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through
the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining
generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential
nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds.
Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms
like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through
PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide
exploration. Experiments across continuous control tasks show that our approach
provides meaningful confidence certificates while maintaining competitive
performance.

Conclusion: 将几何可靠性标准纳入主动学习的样本选择决策中，可以减少对标注错误和分布偏移的敏感性，是实现可信赖部署的关键步骤。

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的集成采样算法框架，用于非线性上下文赌博机问题，包括GLM-ES和Neural-ES两种方法，分别针对广义线性模型和神经网络模型，提供了匹配最先进结果的遗憾界分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为非线性上下文赌博机问题开发一个统一的集成采样算法框架，解决传统方法在非线性模型中的挑战，提供理论保证和实际应用价值。

Method: 通过最大似然估计在随机扰动数据上维护多个奖励模型参数估计器，开发了GLM-ES和Neural-ES两种集成采样方法，并提出了无时间范围假设的随时版本。

Result: 证明了GLM-ES的遗憾界为O(d³/²√T + d⁹/²)，Neural-ES的遗憾界为O(˜d√T)，其中d是特征维度，˜d是神经正切核矩阵的有效维度，T是轮数。

Conclusion: 集成采样被确立为非线性上下文赌博机中可证明且实用的随机探索方法，在理论和实践上都表现出色。

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear
contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common
nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain
multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood
estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist
regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES}
and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is
the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of
a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret
bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms
in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we
introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models.
Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime
versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we
empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime
variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish
ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach
for nonlinear contextual bandits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对图时间序列的保形预测框架，通过利用图结构捕捉节点间依赖关系，在保证指定覆盖概率的同时显著减小预测区域体积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有保形预测方法分别应用于多元时间序列和静态图，但要么忽略了底层图拓扑，要么忽视了时间动态性，需要开发能同时处理图结构和时间动态的预测不确定性量化方法。

Method: 开发基于保形预测的顺序预测区域框架，利用图结构捕捉节点间成对依赖关系，同时提供用户指定的覆盖保证。

Result: 理论证明该方案相比忽略图结构的方法能实现椭球预测集体积的指数级缩小。在真实数据集上，该方法保持期望的经验覆盖概率，同时预测区域比现有方法显著减小（最高减少80%）。

Conclusion: 该不确定性量化框架成功结合了图结构和时间动态，在保证覆盖概率的同时大幅提高了预测精度。

Abstract: Trustworthy decision making in networked, dynamic environments calls for
innovative uncertainty quantification substrates in predictive models for graph
time series. Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods have been applied
separately to multivariate time series and static graphs, but they either
ignore the underlying graph topology or neglect temporal dynamics. To bridge
this gap, here we develop a CP-based sequential prediction region framework
tailored for graph time series. A key technical innovation is to leverage the
graph structure and thus capture pairwise dependencies across nodes, while
providing user-specified coverage guarantees on the predictive outcomes. We
formally establish that our scheme yields an exponential shrinkage in the
volume of the ellipsoidal prediction set relative to its graph-agnostic
counterpart. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the novel
uncertainty quantification framework maintains desired empirical coverage while
achieving markedly smaller (up to 80% reduction) prediction regions than
existing approaches.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the
sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively
studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models,
essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial
structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint.
In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score
estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this
work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state
diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the
score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and
clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can
be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the
literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance
of discrete-state diffusion models.

Result: 在BIDMC数据集上对合成噪声和真实运动伪影均表现出强鲁棒性，优于传统滤波和现有神经模型，能有效恢复PPG信号并保持心率准确性。

Conclusion: SI-SDR损失和心率引导监督具有互补作用，该方法在可穿戴医疗系统中具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, but
its reliability is often degraded by noise and motion artifacts, limiting
downstream applications such as heart rate (HR) estimation. This paper presents
a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving
physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based
denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance
denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an
auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through
HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method
achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion
artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our
method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy,
highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision.
These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical
deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

Abstract: Patent drafting is complex due to its need for detailed technical

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为梯度唯一性的隐私泄露度量方法，用于评估发布机器学习模型时的隐私风险，该方法无需对模型架构、数据类型或攻击策略做任何假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发布机器学习模型时存在隐私泄露风险，需要一种原则性的方法来量化这种风险，并证明发布模型比发布数据集风险更小。

Method: 基于信息泄露上界推导出梯度唯一性度量，并设计了一种基于监控梯度唯一性的简单防御机制。

Result: 该方法在隐私保护方面与DP-SGD相当，但在测试准确率方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 梯度唯一性提供了一种直观的隐私审计方法，能够在保持良好实用性的同时提供有效的隐私保护。

Abstract: Disclosing private information via publication of a machine learning model is
often a concern. Intuitively, publishing a learned model should be less risky
than publishing a dataset. But how much risk is there? In this paper, we
present a principled disclosure metric called \emph{gradient uniqueness} that
is derived from an upper bound on the amount of information disclosure from
publishing a learned model. Gradient uniqueness provides an intuitive way to
perform privacy auditing. The mathematical derivation of gradient uniqueness is
general, and does not make any assumption on the model architecture, dataset
type, or the strategy of an attacker. We examine a simple defense based on
monitoring gradient uniqueness, and find that it achieves privacy comparable to
classical methods such as DP-SGD, while being substantially better in terms of
(utility) testing accuracy.

Motivation: 连接图将网络拓扑与正交变换结合，能表示全局几何一致性，在同步、黎曼信号处理和神经束扩散等应用中很重要。现有方法难以直接从观测信号学习连接图。

Method: 基于一致性假设的最大伪似然框架，提出SCGL算法——在黎曼流形上进行块优化，联合学习网络拓扑、边权重和几何结构。

Result: 实验表明SCGL在拓扑恢复和几何保真度方面始终优于现有基线方法，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: SCGL为从信号数据中学习连接图提供了一个原则性且有效的解决方案，在拓扑和几何结构恢复方面表现出色。

Abstract: Connection graphs (CGs) extend traditional graph models by coupling network
topology with orthogonal transformations, enabling the representation of global
geometric consistency. They play a key role in applications such as
synchronization, Riemannian signal processing, and neural sheaf diffusion. In
this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from
observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum
pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral
properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial
Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection
Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian
manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric
structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing
baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining
computationally efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态自监督学习方法依赖CLIP风格对比目标，容易过拟合到易于对齐的特征，并将有效的跨模态关系误分类为负样本，导致碎片化且不可泛化的嵌入

Method: 引入共享原型字典，将异构模态锚定在共同嵌入空间中，通过围绕共享原型聚类表示而非显式负采样来捕获跨模态互补信息

Result: 在Pulse Motion基础模型中，ProtoMM优于仅对比学习和现有多模态SSL方法，达到最先进性能并提供更好的特征可解释性

Conclusion: ProtoMM为生理信号提供了连贯的"共同语言"，能够更好地捕获系统级动态和跨模态互补信息

Abstract: Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level
dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA,
and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected
physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances
have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches
often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned
features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives,
resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared
prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding
space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than
explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information
across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological
signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model
with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and
prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while
offering improved interpretability of learned features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典通信理论强调最小化冗余以提高传输效率，但有限结构化系统（如真实世界学习）需要冗余来实现稳定性和泛化能力。需要重新定义冗余的角色。

Method: 将冗余表达为一个统一的几何原理家族，包含互信息、卡方依赖和谱冗余等经典度量。通过理论分析和掩码自编码器实验验证。

Result: 发现冗余存在上下界，存在最优平衡点避免过度压缩和过度耦合。实验显示模型在特定冗余水平下泛化能力达到峰值。

Conclusion: 冗余是可测量和可调节的量，连接了通信的渐近世界和学习的有限世界，在结构化系统中具有重要作用。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory
to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental
property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this
framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational
divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual
information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single
geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not
isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory
further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise
to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)
and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors
minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,
such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and
generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are
used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable
redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish
redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic
world of communication and the finite world of learning.

Abstract: Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph
representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through
self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability
to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability
and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues,
we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for
efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN
introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles
node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots
and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based
fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced
feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we
replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which
models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while
maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is
further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global
heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural
networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks,
achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.

Motivation: RLVR训练中常出现策略熵崩溃问题，导致策略过于确定性，阻碍探索并限制推理性能。传统的固定系数熵正则化方法效果不稳定，难以适应不同任务和模型的需求。

Conclusion: 自适应熵正则化能有效解决RLVR训练中的熵崩溃问题，显著提升大语言模型的推理性能，证明了动态调整熵正则化的重要性。

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as
a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy
entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering
exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is
a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed
coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we
revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been
largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty
demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may
require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its
initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a
framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three
components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target
entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms
baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

Result: 发现等变架构比非等变模型扩展性更好，高阶等变表示对应更优的扩展指数，计算最优训练时数据和模型大小应同步扩展。

Conclusion: 不应让模型自行发现对称性等基本归纳偏置，特别是在扩展时，因为这些偏置改变了任务的固有难度和扩展规律。

Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic
potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we
show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and
compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe
that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than
non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order
representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also
suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should
scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results
suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to
discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale,
because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.

Abstract: Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and
engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model
derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we
introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for
Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages
powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear
forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free).
Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to
characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors.
Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing
derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems,
including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.

Conclusion: 为理解Barlow Twins的有效性提供了严格的理论基础，并为分析SSL算法提供了新的几何视角

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

Conclusion: 批量大小和权重衰减在Adam的泛化性能中起关键作用，小批量训练能够显著改善Adam的泛化能力，这为实践中的参数调优提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning,
which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most
existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which
differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD,
stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with
infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization
of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer
over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam
and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error
solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We
further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than
AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$
tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical
role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SVTime是一个受大型视觉模型启发的小型时间序列预测模型，在保持高性能的同时大幅减少参数数量和计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型AI模型虽然性能强大，但训练和推理能耗高，对资源受限用户不友好。需要开发既高效又高性能的轻量级模型来替代大型模型。

Method: 识别大型视觉模型在时间序列预测中的关键归纳偏置，通过精心设计的线性层和约束函数将这些偏置编码到小型模型中。

Result: 在8个基准数据集上，SVTime超越了最先进的轻量级模型，性能与大型模型相当，但参数数量减少了10^3倍，在低资源环境下实现高效训练和推理。

Conclusion: SVTime证明了可以通过精心设计的轻量级模型实现与大型模型相当的性能，为资源受限用户提供了实用的时间序列预测解决方案。

Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge
of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and
transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their
energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models
as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and
sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing
model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained
users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build
cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core
tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing
SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters
for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as
powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM
forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF --
and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted
linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning
lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets,
SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large
models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training
and inference in low-resource settings.

### [101] [How Reinforcement Learning After Next-Token Prediction Facilitates Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11495)
*Nikolaos Tsilivis,Eran Malach,Karen Ullrich,Julia Kempe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论框架来解释为什么在推理任务中，先进行下一词预测训练再使用强化学习的范式比单纯使用下一词预测更有效。通过研究学习奇偶校验任务的混合分布，证明了强化学习能够利用更长的推理序列实现泛化，而单纯下一词预测需要极大的统计或计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络在推理领域的最新进展主要基于一种训练方法：先对大型语言模型进行下一词预测训练，然后使用强化学习算法进行优化。本文旨在理论分析这种范式成功的原因，揭示强化学习如何改进下一词预测的优化机制。

Method: 研究从包含短和长"思维链"序列的混合分布中学习，特别是奇偶校验任务。在简化设置中，理论证明了自回归线性模型通过这种训练方法可以高效学习奇偶预测。同时在实际设置中，对Llama系列模型在数学推理基准的混合变体上进行后训练验证。

Result: 当长序列在数据中稀少时，强化学习能够使自回归变换器实现泛化，而单纯下一词预测需要极端资源。理论证明只要长演示的比例不是输入维度d的指数级小，自回归线性模型就能高效学习奇偶预测。在Llama模型上的实验也验证了相同现象。

Conclusion: 强化学习在推理任务中的成功源于其能够利用增加的测试时间计算（表现为更长的响应）来促进学习过程。这种先下一词预测再强化学习的训练范式在理论和实践中都显示出优于单纯下一词预测的效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been
enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously
trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning
algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and
we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement
learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning
from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences
encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the
parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement
learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to
generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or
computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning
leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to
facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically
prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can
efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion
of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input
dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings,
including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of
common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有防护措施主要在行动执行后运作，难以扩展且缺乏计划层面的可控监督，无法在风险行动执行前进行干预以防止严重后果。

Method: 1) AuraGen：可控引擎合成良性轨迹，注入校准难度的风险类别，通过奖励模型过滤输出；2) Safiron：结合跨规划器适配器和紧凑防护模型，统一输入格式并标记风险；3) Pre-Exec Bench：覆盖多样化工具和分支轨迹的基准。

Conclusion: 该研究为更安全的智能代理系统提供了实用模板，通过填补数据、模型和评估三个关键空白，实现了在计划阶段的可靠风险防护。

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning
stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm,
since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However,
existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale
and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To
address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:
data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce
AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)
injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters
outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for
pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a
foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a
compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while
Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;
trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves
robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release
Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching
trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,
explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail
over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill
actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的决策聚焦学习方法通常依赖确定性点预测，无法充分捕捉现实环境中的随机性，需要能够处理不确定性的新方法。

Method: 使用扩散模型表示参数分布，通过重参数化技巧实现端到端训练；并提出轻量级评分函数估计器，避免通过采样过程的反向传播。

Result: 经验证明，扩散DFL方法在决策质量上持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 扩散DFL是处理决策问题中不确定性的有效方法，通过扩散模型和随机优化提升了决策性能。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and
optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target
rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods
typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient
to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address
this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains
a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and
optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn
from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate
diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training
through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to
the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we
propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward
diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows
from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be
approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that
our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in
decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the
project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.

Motivation: 研究哪些随机过程能够产生直线流，即点加速度为零的流，这样的流可以用一阶方法精确积分，从而简化生成模型的训练和采样过程。

Method: 通过分析随机过程的期望速度场，推导出直线流的PDE特征条件，该条件表现为条件加速度与加权协方差张量散度之间的平衡。

Result: 完全刻画了仿射时间插值过程，证明直线性仅在确定性端点耦合下发生。为设计更易积分的传输过程提供了广泛指导。

Conclusion: 提出了直线流的简洁PDE特征化，为设计更高效、更易积分的生成模型传输过程提供了理论基础和实用指导。

Abstract: We study dynamic measure transport for generative modeling: specifically,
flows induced by stochastic processes that bridge a specified source and target
distribution. The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an
ODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \emph{which processes
produce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration
vanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide
a concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional
acceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor.
Using this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show
that straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We
also derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general
processes, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to
integrate.

Conclusion: D-SPIB提供了一个灵活架构，平衡表征学习和生成目标，能够学习连贯有用的热力学内部表示。

Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional
spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important
events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially
important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a
time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important
representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The
resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information
Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and
generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is
capable of combining temperature information from different molecular
simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation
of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase
its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究乐观Hedge算法在强非耦合学习动态中的遗憾最优性，特别是对行动数m和n的依赖关系，以确定现有遗憾上界是否可进一步改进。

Method: 通过将遗憾上界表示为关于学习率和特定负项系数的优化问题，进行精细化分析；提供算法依赖的个体遗憾下界来证明最优性；基于这些结果改进收敛率和动态遗憾。

Result: 在已知对手行动数的强非耦合设置下，社会遗憾和个体遗憾上界可改进为O(√(log m log n))；证明了这些上界无法进一步改进，且社会遗憾的上下界在主导项常数上完全匹配。

Conclusion: 乐观Hedge算法的社会遗憾界在常数因子级别上是最优的，基于这些结果可以改进收敛率和动态遗憾，并提供了匹配的算法依赖动态遗憾下界。

Abstract: In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge
achieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled
learning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and
individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of
actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality
of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this
end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the
strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known,
both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\log m
\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an
optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of
certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We
then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and
individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge
by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly,
these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant
factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the
last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic
based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent
dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.

Conclusion: 通过时空纠缠的积分核训练，FNOtD能够有效捕捉多尺度波传播，学习海洋动力学，为高分辨率海洋预测提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Neural operators are becoming the default tools to learn solutions to
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in weather and ocean
forecasting applications. Despite early promising achievements, significant
challenges remain, including long-term prediction stability and adherence to
physical laws, particularly for high-frequency processes. In this paper, we
take a step toward addressing these challenges in high-resolution ocean
prediction by incorporating temporal Fourier modes, demonstrating how this
modification enhances physical fidelity. This study compares the standard
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with its variant, FNOtD, which has been modified
to internalize the dispersion relation while learning the solution operator for
ocean PDEs. The results demonstrate that entangling space and time in the
training of integral kernels enables the model to capture multiscale wave
propagation and effectively learn ocean dynamics. FNOtD substantially improves
long-term prediction stability and consistency with underlying physical
dynamics in challenging high-frequency settings compared to the standard FNO.
It also provides competitive predictive skill relative to a state-of-the-art
numerical ocean model, while requiring significantly lower computational cost.

Abstract: This paper proposes a synergy of amortised and particle-based methods for
sampling from distributions defined by unnormalised density functions. We state
a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential
samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein
learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist
functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training
procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt
sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target
distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and
twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training
signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience
replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine
historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay
buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete
spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we
demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as
training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.

Motivation: 机制可解释性研究旨在理解神经网络内部组件如何产生预测，但长期以来存在一个挑战：区分信息的可解码性（从隐藏状态恢复信息的能力）和因果性（这些状态对输出的功能影响程度）。

Method: 使用激活修补技术在干净-损坏图像对之间移植激活，测试空间和CLS标记的因果作用；同时训练线性探针评估不同深度处计数信息的可解码性。

Result: 发现中间层对象标记具有强因果影响但弱可解码性，最终层对象标记支持准确解码但功能上不活跃；CLS标记在中间层变得可解码，但仅在最终层获得因果能力。

Conclusion: 可解码性和因果性反映了表征的互补维度——存在什么信息与使用什么信息——它们的分歧可以揭示隐藏的计算电路。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus
what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational
circuits.

Motivation: 解决连续时间动力系统中存在的近奇异行为问题，特别是在不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程等复杂系统中，轨迹可能表现出奇异性。目标是开发一种能够正则化这些行为同时保持物理守恒定律的方法。

Method: 使用时间提升方法，引入平滑单调映射t↦τ(t)，在提升坐标系中使轨迹全局平滑。该方法作为连续时间归一化或时间扭曲算子，可以稳定物理信息神经网络和其他AI系统中使用的潜在流架构。

Result: 在提升坐标系中，如三维环面上不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程的轨迹变得全局平滑。该方法能够稳定物理信息神经网络和其他潜在流架构，为刚性或湍流过程提供更好的表示学习方法。

Conclusion: 时间提升框架将解析正则性理论与表示学习方法联系起来，为处理刚性和湍流过程提供了一种有效的数学工具，在机器学习和物理建模领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal reparametrization
for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method, called *temporal lifting*,
introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes
near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation
laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become
globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal
lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that
can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow
architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity
theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

include an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear
associations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and
inefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models
(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by
a fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data
is tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal
analysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex
systems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns
from pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of
evidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and
relational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and
conditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data
(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological
datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures
robustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM
significantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies,
achieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal
factors in Hepatitis C virus progression. This work represents a significant
step towards accurate and generalizable causal discovery by successfully
adapting the pattern recognition capabilities of language models to the
intricacies of tabular data.

*Shivam Patel,Neharika Jali,Ankur Mallick,Gauri Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProxRouter是一种非参数化查询路由器，通过指数倾斜聚合机制平衡偏差和方差，提高对异常查询的路由鲁棒性，同时保持正常查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数化路由器需要重新训练和维护，非参数化路由器虽然无需训练但难以处理异常查询，且训练集多样性有限难以跟上不断演化的用例。

Method: 采用指数倾斜聚合机制来平衡非参数化路由器中的偏差和方差，提高对异常查询的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明ProxRouter在保持正常查询性能的同时，显著提升了异常查询的路由效果，且开销极小。

Conclusion: ProxRouter通过创新的聚合机制有效解决了非参数化路由器在异常查询上的泛化问题，为LLM查询路由提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms
as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate,
yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks
for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads.
Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and
cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set
queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers
struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited
diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep
current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an
exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in
nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show
ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with
minimal overhead.

TL;DR: WARC-Bench是一个新的网页导航基准测试，包含438个任务，专注于评估AI代理在网页子任务上的能力，如日期选择器操作、滚动容器等。该基准使用Web ARChive文件实现沙盒化的动态网页交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能充分评估AI代理在网页子任务上的能力，而这些短时程交互对于复杂的网页导航至关重要。需要专门的基准来测试代理在动态网页上的基本操作能力。

Method: 使用Web ARChive文件创建沙盒化的动态网页环境。探索两种训练技术：监督微调(SFT)和基于可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)，在数据稀缺环境下对SFT检查点进行RLVR训练。

Result: 领先的计算机使用模型在WARC-Bench上的最高成功率仅为64.8%。SFT模型获得48.8%的成功率，而SFT+RLVR组合将成功率提升至52.8%，超过了许多前沿模型。

Conclusion: 掌握网页子任务对于稳健的网页规划和导航至关重要，这是现有基准未能充分评估的能力。RLVR训练即使在数据稀缺环境下也能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Training web agents to navigate complex, real-world websites requires them to
master $\textit{subtasks}$ - short-horizon interactions on multiple UI
components (e.g., choosing the correct date in a date picker, or scrolling in a
container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive
Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to
evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed
interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We
show that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the
highest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on
subtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments
show that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training
with RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the
score to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models. Our analysis
concludes that mastering these subtasks is essential for robust web planning
and navigation, and is a capability not extensively evaluated by existing
benchmarks.

*Soheila Farokhi,Xiaojun Qi,Hamid Karimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAWRMAC是一个用于动态图表示学习的新框架，通过整合时间匿名游走、内存增强和邻居共现嵌入，解决了现有方法在嵌入稳定性、上下文感知和结构动态捕捉方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续时间动态图学习方法存在三个关键问题：仅依赖节点特定内存导致嵌入过时；未能显式捕捉节点邻域相关性；无法充分捕捉演化图的结构动态。

Method: 提出TAWRMAC框架，整合时间匿名游走重启机制、内存增强GNN和邻居共现嵌入，通过固定时间编码增强嵌入稳定性，显式捕捉邻居相关性，并区分重复交互和新建连接。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，TAWRMAC在动态链接预测和节点分类任务中，在转导和归纳设置下均优于最先进方法，且对三种不同负采样策略都具有一致性优势。

Conclusion: TAWRMAC通过提供稳定、可泛化且上下文感知的嵌入，推进了连续时间动态图学习的技术水平。

Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing
evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation
systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face
three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory
without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting
in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations
between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to
fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence
of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a
novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory
Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding
stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves
contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations.
Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes
between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new
connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures
structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction
and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across
three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable,
generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the
art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2J是一个提示增强框架，通过构建修复后的PyTorch到JAX翻译数据集和结构化指导提示，显著提升轻量级LLM在PyTorch到JAX代码翻译中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PyTorch和JAX虽然都嵌入在Python中，但在核心设计、执行语义和生态系统成熟度上存在差异。JAX相对较新，公开代码较少，且平行PyTorch-JAX语料库有限，现有评估方法在跨框架基准测试中存在不足。

Method: 构建两阶段流程：(1) 使用GPT-4o-mini从TorchLeet和CodeParrot的PyTorch代码生成初始JAX草稿；(2) 专业开发者迭代修复草稿，构建包含常见错误和修复的精选数据集；(3) 基于修复数据构建增强提示来指导轻量级LLM。

Result: T2J将GPT-4o-mini在CodeBLEU上的性能提升高达10%，T2J修复成本得分提升50%，T2J代码翻译得分提升1.33分（0-4分制），T2J比较得分提升100%，生成的代码运行速度比基线快2.5倍。

Conclusion: T2J框架通过结构化指导提示有效解决了PyTorch到JAX翻译的挑战，显著提升了翻译质量和效率，为跨框架代码翻译提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation
among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The
two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution
semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively
underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited.
Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework
benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens
LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch
sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a
GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini
to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to
iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a
curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs
augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer
lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored
to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based
estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge).
Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50%
on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100%
on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster
than the baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对Transformer中Layer Normalization的不同放置位置进行了理论分析，研究其对前向传播（隐藏状态）和后向传播（梯度）稳定性的影响，为Transformer的稳定训练提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer被广泛使用，但其训练过程可能不稳定。Layer Normalization作为标准组件能提高训练稳定性，但其放置位置往往缺乏理论依据。

Method: 通过理论分析研究不同Layer Normalization放置位置下的前向稳定性（隐藏状态增长边界）和后向稳定性（梯度反向传播动态），并指导残差连接步长的缩放。

Result: 理论分析揭示了不同Layer Normalization放置对训练动态的影响，数值结果验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 该框架为检查新架构修改下Transformer的稳定性提供了原则性方法，为未来设计提供指导。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable.
Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its
placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study
on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of
Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory
provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives
Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward
stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained
Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization
affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training
dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the
scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can
further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate
our theoretical findings. Beyond these results, our framework provides a
principled way to sanity-check the stability of Transformers under new
architectural modifications, offering guidance for future designs.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive
biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In
this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model),
a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based
generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from
large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward
candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This
integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific
therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In
targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved
binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art
generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules
designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease
mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced
generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical
therapeutic development.

healthier drinking habits, we introduce a groundbreaking mobile smartwatch
application approach to just-in-time interventions for intoxication warnings.
In this work, we have created a dataset gathering TAC, accelerometer,

TL;DR: 该研究探索了复值卷积神经网络在音频信号处理中的应用，重点研究如何保留和利用实值网络中常被忽略的相位信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实值神经网络在处理音频信号时往往忽略相位信息，而复值神经网络能够更好地保留和利用完整的复数表示，从而提升音频处理性能。

Method: 提出复值CNN的理论框架，包括复数卷积、池化层、Wirtinger微分和复数激活函数，并采用复数批归一化和权重初始化技术确保训练稳定性。通过三个阶段进行实证评估：图像数据集基准测试、基于MFCC的音频分类、以及引入图神经网络建模相位信息。

Result: 在图像数据集上，复值CNN与实值CNN表现相当；在音频分类中，复值CNN在实值MFCC上略有优势；通过图神经网络建模相位信息后，在二元和多类音乐流派分类中均获得可测量的性能提升。

Conclusion: 复值架构具有强大的表达能力，相位信息是音频处理中有意义且可利用的特征。虽然当前方法（特别是cardioid激活函数）显示出潜力，但未来需要进一步开发相位感知设计来充分发挥复数表示在神经网络中的潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the design and application of Complex-Valued
Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing, with a focus
on preserving and utilizing phase information often neglected in real-valued
networks. We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of
CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based
differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are
complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex
batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in
training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages.
First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they
demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic
complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first
evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and
validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second
experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform
real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in
exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third
experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where
the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class
genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of
complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable
feature in audio processing applications. While current methods show promise,
especially with activations like cardioid, future advances in phase-aware
design will be essential to leverage the potential of complex representations
in neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MemPromptTSS框架，通过持久提示记忆实现迭代多粒度时间序列分割，解决现有方法中提示影响快速衰减的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割的提示方法仅在局部上下文操作，提示效果快速消失，无法在整个序列中指导预测。需要一种能够保持提示持久影响的方法。

Method: 引入持久提示记忆，通过记忆编码器将提示及其周围子序列转换为存储在记忆库中的记忆令牌，使每个新预测不仅基于局部线索，还基于所有迭代中积累的提示。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验显示，MemPromptTSS在单次迭代推理中比最佳基线在单粒度和多粒度分割上分别提升23%和85%准确率；在迭代推理中平均每次迭代增益为2.66个百分点，优于PromptTSS的1.19。

Conclusion: 持久记忆对于提示引导的分割至关重要，MemPromptTSS为实际应用提供了实用有效的框架。

Abstract: Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate
multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from
coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings
requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement
through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting
domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series
segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt
quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To
overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative
multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A
memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into
memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new
prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts
accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the
entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and
industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy
improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity
segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement
in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage
points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance
of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS
as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘-云推测解码中，边缘-云链路的有限带宽限制了草稿token分布的高效压缩，这是加速推理的主要瓶颈。

Method: 提出SQS-SD框架，利用分布稀疏性进行结构化稀疏化和格子量化。K-SQS使用固定top-K截断，C-SQS通过在线符合预测自适应调整保留的token集。

Result: 实验结果表明，两种方法在互补的操作机制下都能改善端到端延迟和拒绝率。

Conclusion: SQS-SD框架通过信息论指导的压缩方法有效解决了边缘-云推测解码中的带宽限制问题。

Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a
cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by
a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central
bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates
efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an
information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into
contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization
distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample
SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through
structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this
framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts
the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded
deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both
approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary
operating regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)算法，用于在线强化学习微调基于流匹配的视觉-语言-动作模型，解决了传统策略梯度方法在流匹配模型中的重要性采样不可行性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型如OpenVLA、Octo和π₀虽然通过大规模演示数据展现了良好的泛化能力，但其性能仍受限于监督数据的质量和覆盖范围。强化学习提供了通过在线交互改进这些模型的途径，但传统策略梯度方法在流匹配模型中由于重要性采样的不可行性而无法应用。

Method: FPO算法通过利用条件流匹配目标中每个样本的变化来重新构建重要性采样过程。该算法集成了结构感知信用分配以增强梯度效率、裁剪代理目标以稳定优化、多步潜在探索以鼓励多样化的策略更新，以及Q集成机制以提供鲁棒的价值估计。

Result: 在LIBERO基准和ALOHA模拟任务上的评估表明，FPO相对于监督学习、偏好对齐、基于扩散的方法、自回归在线RL和π₀-FAST基线方法，在模仿先验和强替代方法上均取得了持续改进，并在稀疏奖励下实现了稳定学习。

Conclusion: 消融研究和潜在空间动态分析进一步验证了FPO中各个组件的贡献，证明了所提出的计算模块的有效性以及条件流匹配目标在在线强化学习期间的稳定收敛性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as OpenVLA, Octo, and $\pi_0$ have
shown strong generalization by leveraging large-scale demonstrations, yet their
performance is still fundamentally constrained by the quality and coverage of
supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for
improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However,
conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the
context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the
importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy
ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)
algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample
changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves
stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by
integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency,
clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent
exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to
provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and
the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned,
diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines,
observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong
alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation
studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the
contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness
of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the
conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.

Abstract: Online sensing plays an important role in advancing modern manufacturing. The
real-time sensor signals, which can be stored as high-resolution time series
data, contain rich information about the operation status. One of its popular
usages is online process monitoring, which can be achieved by effective anomaly
detection from the sensor signals. However, most existing approaches either
heavily rely on labeled data for training supervised models, or are designed to
detect only extreme outliers, thus are ineffective at identifying subtle
semantic off-track anomalies to capture where new regimes or unexpected
routines start. To address this challenge, we propose an matrix profile-based
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that captures fabrication cycle
similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset
of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated by the experiments on real-world sensor data.

can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction
goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be
captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships
between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned
by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which
focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph
representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the
system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation.
While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze
software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph
representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process
interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for
deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a
pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process
Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint
embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose
GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from
both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318
malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run
sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive
gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了BITE（双向时频金字塔网络），一种端到端的统一架构，通过多流协同、金字塔时频注意力和双向自适应卷积，显著提升了EEG识别的跨范式泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG识别模型由于数据集特定约束和个体变异性，在跨范式泛化方面表现不佳，需要开发更鲁棒的通用架构。

Method: 采用对齐的时频流保持时间同步，使用金字塔时频注意力增强多尺度特征，结合双向自适应卷积捕获前向/后向神经动态。

Result: 在四个不同范式（BCICIV-2A/2B、HGD、SD-SSVEP）上达到最先进性能，在受试者内准确率和跨受试者泛化方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: 验证了范式对齐的频谱-时间处理对于可靠BCI系统至关重要，BITE作为统一架构在MI和SSVEP任务中均表现出鲁棒性能和优异计算效率。

Abstract: Existing EEG recognition models suffer from poor cross-paradigm
generalization due to dataset-specific constraints and individual variability.
To overcome these limitations, we propose BITE (Bidirectional Time-Freq Pyramid
Network), an end-to-end unified architecture featuring robust multistream
synergy, pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA), and bidirectional adaptive
convolutions. The framework uniquely integrates: 1) Aligned time-frequency
streams maintaining temporal synchronization with STFT for bidirectional
modeling, 2) PTFA-based multi-scale feature enhancement amplifying critical
neural patterns, 3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward
neural dynamics. Demonstrating enhanced robustness, BITE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four divergent paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B,
HGD, SD-SSVEP), excelling in both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject
generalization. As a unified architecture, it combines robust performance
across both MI and SSVEP tasks with exceptional computational efficiency. Our
work validates that paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is essential
for reliable BCI systems. Just as its name suggests, BITE "takes a bite out of
EEG." The source code is available at https://github.com/cindy-hong/BiteEEG.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAT是一种新的微调策略，利用更强LLM的元认知能力作为教师，通过分析学生模型的技能缺失情况来创建针对性的训练集，显著提升数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调在类似训练数据上效果有限，模型容易出现性能饱和现象，需要更有效的训练方法来提升推理能力。

Method: STAT方法：教师模型分析任务所需技能并标记数据点，通过监控学生回答创建缺失技能档案，然后通过STAT-Sel（重新加权现有训练样本）或STAT-Syn（合成缺失技能相关样本）构建修改后的训练集。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上，STAT方法在MATH数据集上提升高达7.5%，在分布外基准测试上平均提升4.6%，且与GRPO强化学习方法互补。

Conclusion: 技能导向的自适应训练能够显著改进当前训练流程，有效解决模型技能缺失问题。

Abstract: Language models often show little to no improvement (i.e., "saturation") when
trained via vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on data similar to what they
saw in their training set (e.g., MATH). We introduce a new fine-tuning
strategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition
ability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher
uses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then
labels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By
monitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile
for the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their
responses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two
ways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but
adaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,
the teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across
extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements
of up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,
STAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,
AMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is
complementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved
using STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We
conclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current
training pipelines. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 低空经济网络中无人机配备视觉语言模型进行实时多模态推理时，有限的机载资源和动态网络条件使得同时保证推理精度和通信效率成为挑战。

Method: 设计了分层优化框架：ARPO算法用于精度约束下的资源分配，LLaRA方法利用大语言模型离线优化强化学习的奖励设计，实现自适应无人机轨迹优化。

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机驱动的低空经济网络提供了一种高效的联合优化方案，在保证任务精度的同时显著降低了延迟和功耗。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) has enabled
a variety of applications, including aerial surveillance, environmental
sensing, and semantic data collection. To support these scenarios, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard vision-language models (VLMs)
offer a promising solution for real-time multimodal inference. However,
ensuring both inference accuracy and communication efficiency remains a
significant challenge due to limited onboard resources and dynamic network
conditions. In this paper, we first propose a UAV-enabled LAENet system model
that jointly captures UAV mobility, user-UAV communication, and the onboard
visual question answering (VQA) pipeline. Based on this model, we formulate a
mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to minimize task latency and
power consumption under user-specific accuracy constraints. To solve the
problem, we design a hierarchical optimization framework composed of two parts:
(i) an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm for
resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and (ii) a Large Language
Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for adaptive UAV
trajectory optimization. The large language model (LLM) serves as an expert in
refining reward design of reinforcement learning in an offline fashion,
introducing no additional latency in real-time decision-making. Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving
inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet
conditions.

Result: 在所有设置中显著提升区分能力(AUC=0.9573)、校准能力(ECE=0.053)和鲁棒性，优于传统基线方法。

Conclusion: FOSSIL是医学影像数据稀缺场景下可泛化、数据高效且可解释的难度感知学习框架。

Abstract: Deep learning in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets remains
fundamentally constrained by unstable optimization and poor generalization. We
present the first biomedical implementation of FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization
via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning), a regret-minimizing weighting
framework that adaptively balances training emphasis according to sample
difficulty. Using softmax-based uncertainty as a continuous measure of
difficulty, we construct a four-stage curriculum (Easy-Very Hard) and integrate
FOSSIL into both convolutional and transformer-based architectures for Mpox
skin lesion diagnosis. Across all settings, FOSSIL substantially improves
discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness under
real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without
metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation. The results position
FOSSIL as a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for
difficulty-aware learning in medical imaging under data scarcity.

TL;DR: 提出One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP)框架，解决3D装箱问题中稳定性约束和不同箱子尺寸泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法忽略实际稳定性约束，且在多样化箱子尺寸上泛化能力有限。

Method: 使用加权奖励函数结合装载率和高度差指标，采用裁剪策略梯度优化和策略漂移方法防止策略熵崩溃。

Result: O4M-SP在多样化箱子尺寸上成功泛化，显著优于基线方法，并能有效处理稳定性约束场景。

Conclusion: O4M-SP框架在解决3D装箱问题中表现出色，具有强大的实际应用价值。

Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is widely applied in
logistics and warehousing. Existing learning-based approaches often neglect
practical stability-related constraints and exhibit limitations in generalizing
across diverse bin dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
deep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP). The
primary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in
a single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints
common in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms.
First, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a
new height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin
utilization through flatter packing configurations. Second, it combines clipped
policy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting method to mitigate
policy entropy collapse, encouraging exploration at critical decision nodes
during packing to avoid suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that O4M-SP generalizes successfully across diverse bin dimensions and
significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, O4M-SP exhibits strong
practical applicability by effectively addressing packing scenarios with
stability constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力能自适应识别相关元素但依赖绝对位置嵌入，卷积能相对编码但固定核大小限制自适应选择能力，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 提出Translution操作统一自注意力的自适应识别和卷积的相对编码优势，并设计轻量级变体α-Translution解决参数量过大的问题。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务上的实验表明，Translution（包括α-Translution）相比自注意力实现了更高的准确率。

Conclusion: Translution成功结合了自注意力和卷积的优势，在保持高性能的同时通过轻量级变体解决了计算资源限制问题。

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at

TL;DR: ADEPT是一个用于持续预训练的自适应扩展和解耦调优框架，通过选择性层扩展和自适应单元解耦调优来解决灾难性遗忘和领域容量限制问题，在数学和医学基准测试中表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 传统持续预训练存在灾难性遗忘和有限领域容量问题，现有层扩展方法仍会纠缠通用和领域学习，需要功能感知的参数扩展和优化。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 通用能力引导的选择性层扩展，复制对通用领域最不关键的层；2) 自适应单元解耦调优，根据通用领域重要性分离参数单元并分配非对称学习率。

Result: 在数学和医学基准测试中，ADEPT比全参数持续预训练在通用领域提升5.76%，目标领域提升5.58%，仅需调优15%参数和不到50%训练时间。

Conclusion: 定向扩展和解耦优化对于高效稳健的领域自适应持续预训练是必要的，为该方法提供了新原则。

Abstract: Conventional continual pretraining (CPT) for large language model (LLM)
domain adaptation often suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited domain
capacity. Existing strategies adopt layer expansion, introducing additional
trainable parameters to accommodate new knowledge. However, the uniform
expansion and updates still entangle general and domain learning, undermining
its effectiveness. Our pilot studies reveal that LLMs exhibit functional
specialization, where layers and units differentially encode general-critical
capabilities, suggesting that parameter expansion and optimization should be
function-aware. We then propose ADEPT, Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled
Tuning for continual pretraining, a two-stage framework for domain-adaptive
CPT. ADEPT first performs General-Competence Guided Selective Layer Expansion,
duplicating layers least critical for the general domain to increase
representational capacity while minimizing interference with general knowledge.
It then applies Adaptive Unit-Wise Decoupled Tuning, disentangling parameter
units within expanded layers according to their general-domain importance and
assigning asymmetric learning rates to balance knowledge injection and
retention. Experiments on mathematical and medical benchmarks show that ADEPT
outperforms full-parameter CPT by up to 5.76% on the general domain and 5.58%
on the target domain with only 15% of parameters tuned and less than 50%
training time. Ablation studies, theoretical analysis, and extended
investigations further demonstrate the necessity of targeted expansion and
decoupled optimization, providing new principles for efficient and robust
domain-adaptive CPT. Our code is open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在时间序列分类中表现出色，但它们容易依赖训练数据中的伪相关性，这种捷径行为在时间序列领域尚未得到充分研究。现有研究多关注外部属性，而忽略了时间序列模型内部的偏差行为。

Method: 提出了一种基于其他类别的简单检测方法，用于识别捷径学习行为，该方法不需要测试数据或干净的训练类别。

Result: 在UCR时间序列数据集上测试了所提出的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究首次确立了深度学习时间序列分类中的基于点捷径学习行为，并提供了有效的检测方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models have attracted lots of research attention in time series
classification (TSC) task in the past two decades. Recently, deep neural
networks (DNN) have surpassed classical distance-based methods and achieved
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their promising performance, deep neural
networks (DNNs) have been shown to rely on spurious correlations present in the
training data, which can hinder generalization. For instance, a model might
incorrectly associate the presence of grass with the label ``cat" if the
training set have majority of cats lying in grassy backgrounds. However, the
shortcut behavior of DNNs in time series remain under-explored. Most existing
shortcut work are relying on external attributes such as gender, patients
group, instead of focus on the internal bias behavior in time series models.
  In this paper, we take the first step to investigate and establish
point-based shortcut learning behavior in deep learning time series
classification. We further propose a simple detection method based on other
class to detect shortcut occurs without relying on test data or clean training
classes. We test our proposed method in UCR time series datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过着色算法理论解释了图神经网络表达力与泛化能力之间的权衡关系，证明了Weisfeiler-Leman着色诱导的等价类数量直接限制了GNN的Rademacher复杂度，揭示了更强的表达能力导致更高的复杂度从而削弱泛化保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然表达能力更强的GNN可以区分更多类型的图，但实践中观察到它们往往具有更高的泛化误差。本文旨在从理论上解释这种表达能力与泛化能力之间的权衡关系。

Method: 通过着色算法的视角，将WL着色诱导的等价类数量与GNN的Rademacher复杂度联系起来，证明两者之间的直接约束关系，并分析复杂度在不同样本间颜色计数扰动下的稳定性。

Result: 证明了表达能力越强的GNN具有越高的Rademacher复杂度，从而导致更弱的泛化保证。同时证明了复杂度在颜色计数扰动下具有稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了GNN表达能力和泛化能力的研究，为理解表达能力增强往往以牺牲泛化为代价提供了理论基础，且该框架适用于任意GNN架构和表达能力度量方法。

Abstract: The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood
through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a
richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher
generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this
trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of
coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence
classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity
-- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that
greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization
guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable
under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring
robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework
is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN
architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence
classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in
GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power
often comes at the cost of generalization.

TL;DR: PANTHER是一个混合生成-判别框架，通过生成式预训练从无标签用户行为数据中学习可迁移表示，统一了用户行为预训练和下游任务适应，在微信支付中实现了25.6%的下次交易预测提升和38.6%的欺诈检测召回率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能封装广泛的世界知识，但在建模用户交互历史中的行为知识方面仍有局限。用户行为构成独特模态，每个动作包含时间、上下文等多维属性，建模这些高基数序列具有挑战性。

Method: 提出PANTHER框架，包含：结构化标记化将多维交易属性压缩为可解释词汇表；序列模式识别模块建模周期性交易模式；统一用户画像嵌入融合静态人口统计和动态交易历史；通过离线缓存预训练嵌入实现实时可扩展性。

Result: 在微信支付中完全部署运行，下次交易预测HitRate@1提升25.6%，欺诈检测召回率相对提升38.6%。在公共基准上的跨域评估显示强泛化能力，相比transformer基线实现高达21%的HitRate@1增益。

Conclusion: PANTHER被确立为工业级序列用户行为建模的可扩展、高性能框架，证明了生成式预训练在用户行为建模中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can
distill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs
encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the
behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior
forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional
attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a
behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and
discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this
gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable
representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from
text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that
unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling
large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference.
PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional
transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern
Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a
Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic
transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching
of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and
operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in
next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement
in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public
benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1
gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable,
high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.

TL;DR: Lighter-X是一个高效的图神经网络推荐系统框架，通过压缩稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵，将参数复杂度从O(n×d)降低到O(h×d)，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的推荐系统（如LightGCN）需要为每个节点维护d维嵌入，参数复杂度为O(n×d)，在大规模图应用中面临可扩展性挑战。

Method: 分析原始结构和参数冗余，提出稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵的高效压缩方案，采用解耦框架优化训练过程。

Result: 在大规模交互图上，仅使用LightGCN 1%的参数就能达到相当甚至更好的性能。

Conclusion: Lighter-X显著减少了参数大小和计算复杂度，同时保持了基础模型的理论保证和实证性能，实现了大规模实际部署。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as
LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting
in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents
the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant
challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world
applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose
\textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach
substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while
preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base
models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we
analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters,
identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose
an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and
high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized
through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the
training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with
significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction
graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with
only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs依赖人工标注标签且难以处理复杂多样的局部拓扑结构，LLMs在少样本学习上表现良好但面临可扩展性挑战，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 开发GNN偏好驱动的节点选择器促进LLMs到教师GNNs的预测蒸馏，以及节点偏好驱动的GNN选择器为每个节点匹配合适的教师GNN进行个性化知识蒸馏。

Result: 在真实世界文本属性图上的大量实验验证了该框架在少样本节点分类中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该偏好驱动知识蒸馏框架成功结合了LLMs和GNNs的互补优势，有效解决了少样本节点分类问题。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs
(TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily
relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local
topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single
mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in
zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge.
Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD)
framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for
few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven
node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to
teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a
node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher
GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from
teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of
our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

*Bin Yang,Qiuyu Leng,Jun Zeng,Zhenhua Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CacheClip是一个解决RAG系统中TTFT瓶颈的新框架，通过辅助LLM指导的KV缓存选择性重计算、共享前缀和分组策略，在保持高生成质量的同时显著加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存复用方法在RAG场景中存在基本权衡：前缀缓存需要相同前缀但RAG中很少出现，直接预计算因缺少跨块注意力和重复注意力下沉而牺牲质量。APE和CacheBlend等方法仍不足以支持稳健的RAG应用。

Method: CacheClip集成三种技术：(1)辅助模型指导的令牌选择进行选择性KV缓存重计算，辅助模型经过微调以提高选择准确性；(2)共享前缀消除冗余注意力下沉；(3)分组策略在部分KV缓存更新期间保持局部连贯性。

Result: 实验显示CacheClip在NIAH和LongBench上分别保持了94.8%和85.0%的全注意力性能，在NIAH上比APE和CacheBlend分别高出25.2%和35.1%（重计算率=20%）。同时，CacheClip将LLM推理的预填充时间加速高达1.92倍。

Conclusion: CacheClip通过利用辅助LLM与主LLM相似的最后一层注意力分布，有效识别恢复跨块注意力所需的关键令牌，为RAG系统中的效率-质量权衡提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe
time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV
cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires
identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct
precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and
repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially
address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This
paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and
high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit
similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model
for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for
restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response
quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:
(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache
recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection
accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)
grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.
Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention
performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%
and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM
inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the
efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

TL;DR: PermLLM提出了一种可学习的通道置换方法，通过Sinkhorn归一化将离散置换矩阵转换为可微分的软置换矩阵，实现端到端优化，显著提升了N:M稀疏模型的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的通道置换方法依赖手工设计的质量指标，往往无法准确捕捉剪枝对模型性能的真实影响，需要更智能的置换优化方法。

Method: 使用可学习通道置换(LCP)，通过Sinkhorn归一化实现离散置换矩阵的微分近似，结合高效的块级通道置换策略减少可学习参数和计算复杂度。

Result: 在LLaMA系列、Qwen和OPT模型上的大量实验表明，PermLLM在优化N:M稀疏模型方面实现了优越的性能。

Conclusion: PermLLM能够自适应优化通道置换，有效减轻剪枝引起的误差，为N:M稀疏模型提供了有效的后训练剪枝框架。

Abstract: Channel permutation is a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of N:M
sparse models by reordering the channels of weight matrices to prioritize the
retention of important weights. However, traditional channel permutation
methods rely on handcrafted quality metrics, which often fail to accurately
capture the true impact of pruning on model performance. To address this
limitation, we propose PermLLM, a novel post-training pruning framework that
introduces learnable channel permutation (LCP) for N:M sparsity. LCP leverages
Sinkhorn normalization to transform discrete permutation matrices into
differentiable soft permutation matrices, enabling end-to-end optimization.
Additionally, PermLLM incorporates an efficient block-wise channel permutation
strategy, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and
computational complexity. PermLLM seamlessly integrates with existing one-shot
pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel permutations, effectively
mitigating pruning-induced errors. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA series,
Qwen, and OPT models demonstrate that PermLLM achieves superior performance in
optimizing N:M sparse models. The code is available at

Result: 在长期预测基准测试中，FIRE始终优于最先进模型，实现了优越的预测性能并显著增强了时间序列的可解释性。

Conclusion: FIRE通过频域分解方法为时间序列预测提供了数学抽象，实现了可解释且鲁棒的预测性能。

Abstract: Current approaches for time series forecasting, whether in the time or
frequency domain, predominantly use deep learning models based on linear layers
or transformers. They often encode time series data in a black-box manner and
rely on trial-and-error optimization solely based on forecasting performance,
leading to limited interpretability and theoretical understanding. Furthermore,
the dynamics in data distribution over time and frequency domains pose a
critical challenge to accurate forecasting. We propose FIRE, a unified
frequency domain decomposition framework that provides a mathematical
abstraction for diverse types of time series, so as to achieve interpretable
and robust time series forecasting. FIRE introduces several key innovations:
(i) independent modeling of amplitude and phase components, (ii) adaptive
learning of weights of frequency basis components, (iii) a targeted loss
function, and (iv) a novel training paradigm for sparse data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
models on long-term forecasting benchmarks, achieving superior predictive
performance and significantly enhancing interpretability of time series

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have the generative controllability by
incorporating external conditions. However, their performance significantly
degrades with noisy conditions, such as corrupted labels in the image
generation or unreliable observations or states in the control policy
generation. This paper introduces a robust learning framework to address
extremely noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models. We empirically
demonstrate that existing noise-robust methods fail when the noise level is
high. To overcome this, we propose learning pseudo conditions as surrogates for
clean conditions and refining pseudo ones progressively via the technique of
temporal ensembling. Additionally, we develop a Reverse-time Diffusion
Condition (RDC) technique, which diffuses pseudo conditions to reinforce the
memorization effect and further facilitate the refinement of the pseudo
conditions. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and
visuomotor policy generation tasks.The code can be accessible via the project

Motivation: RLVR训练过程中存在熵崩溃风险，即策略多样性快速丧失，导致泛化能力不足。现有熵干预方法机制不明确且效果有限，需要更直接有效的熵动态控制方法。

Method: 提出STEER方法，通过熵变化感知的重加权方案，在token级别进行自适应调整，稳定熵动态，平衡探索与利用。

Conclusion: STEER通过直接控制熵动态，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为RLVR训练提供了更稳定和有效的熵管理方案。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM
reasoning, its training process poses a critical risk: entropy collapse. This
phenomenon is a rapid loss of policy diversity, stemming from the
exploration-exploitation imbalance and leading to a lack of generalization.
Recent entropy-intervention methods aim to prevent \coloredtext{entropy
collapse}, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, we
conduct a quantitative analysis to reveal token-level entropy changes and how
existing entropy intervention methods help avoid entropy collapse. Our findings
point out a fundamental limitation of existing methods: they attempt to control
entropy dynamics indirectly. By only affecting related factors, such as the
advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently
limited and could potentially fail. To address this limitation, we introduce an
entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely Stabilizing Token-level
Entropy-changE via Reweighting (STEER), that adaptively stabilizes entropy
dynamics through fine-grained token-level adjustments. Our approach mitigates
over-exploitation while fostering robust exploration. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes
entropy dynamics, and achieves stronger downstream performance across various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks \footnote{Our code is available at

Conclusion: CauchyNet作为一种高效的数据驱动预测建模工具，在资源受限和数据稀缺环境中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: A novel neural network inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, is proposed for
function approximation tasks that include time series forecasting, missing data
imputation, etc. Hence, the novel neural network is named CauchyNet. By
embedding real-valued data into the complex plane, CauchyNet efficiently
captures complex temporal dependencies, surpassing traditional real-valued
models in both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Grounded in
Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem,
CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The
architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust
learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint
and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse
domains, including transportation, energy consumption, and epidemiological
data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive
accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer
parameters. These findings highlight CauchyNet's potential as an effective and
efficient tool for data-driven predictive modeling, particularly in
resource-constrained and data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to
overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of
heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works
attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving
entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a
novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space,
and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from
either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and
the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as
a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can
be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the
expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to
compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward
signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within
the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation
for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and
suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

Conclusion: GraphBFN通过统一训练与推理过程，有效解决了分子图生成中连续-离散不一致的问题，提升了生成质量和效率。

Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation
problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently,
prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict
continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression
task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert
these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is
intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is
not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy
between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a
consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to
overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts
are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to
the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished
molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To
address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical
coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the
parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative
Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of
selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with
the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art
results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

Motivation: 递归自修改在AutoML、神经架构搜索和自适应优化中越来越重要，但现有框架无法确保此类更改的安全性。哥德尔机通过要求在重写代码前提供改进的形式证明来提供原则性保护，但在随机高维设置中此类证明无法获得。

Method: 引入统计哥德尔机(SGM)，用统计置信度测试(e值、Hoeffding界)替代证明要求；提出确认触发调和支出(CTHS)，通过确认事件而非轮次来索引支出，将错误预算集中在有希望的编辑上，同时保持族有效性。

Conclusion: 这些结果将SGM定位为学习系统中持续、风险感知自修改的基础设施。

Abstract: Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural
architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework
ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled
safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code;
however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings.
We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety
layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with
statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a
modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level,
while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across
rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which
indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the
error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise
validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and
black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on
CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates
robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position
SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification
in learning systems.Code is available at:

Conclusion: PSCNet通过有效建模土壤湿度数据中复杂的时空关系，为时空降尺度提供了一个有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological and meteorological
processes. High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive
microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of
SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary
factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal
resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the
low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale
convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative
components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing
temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained
seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km
spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP
demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet
exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881,
outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet
consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all
sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3)
In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using
high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as
all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric
and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization
validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid
spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for
spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate
spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials
science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor
cross-task generalization, and lack of chemical reasoning capabilities.
Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while
specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their

\textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates
chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to
enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training
strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning
trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models,
followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR
employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical
principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency
through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets
demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner
outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional
cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that
provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially
enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists. Code is

Abstract: Exploring machine learning techniques for addressing vehicle routing problems
has attracted considerable research attention. To achieve decent and efficient
solutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically
trained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially
limits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus
hampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a
continual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with
instances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design
an inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from
smaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other
hand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model
by imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size.
Additionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly
trained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across
various problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to
state-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for
generalizability enhancement. Meanwhile, the ablation studies on the key

*Nikolaus Salvatore,Hao Wang,Qiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs在长文本中表现出"中间信息丢失"现象，类似于人类记忆的首因和近因效应。研究发现这不是简单的信息丢失缺陷，而是预训练过程中适应不同信息检索需求的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在长文本处理中表现出的位置偏见现象，特别是为什么重要信息在中间位置时性能会下降，以及这种现象与人类记忆机制的相似性。

Method: 从零开始训练GPT-2和Llama变体模型，使用模拟长时记忆和短时记忆需求的简单人类记忆范式，分析模型在不同位置的信息检索表现。

Result: 实验表明U形性能曲线确实出现，近因效应与训练数据中的短时记忆需求直接对应，首因效应则由均匀的长时记忆需求诱导，并受自回归特性和注意力汇聚形成的影响。

Conclusion: 信息检索需求、模型架构和训练过程中的结构注意力动态共同导致了LLMs中观察到的位置偏见，这种现象是模型适应不同任务需求的自然结果。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial
information is in the middle of a long context, a "lost-in-the-middle"
phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We
propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss
but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during
pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a
long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information
(a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this
U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are
trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term
and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency
effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the
primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is
additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the
formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory
paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely
resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our
findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and
structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce
positional bias observed in LLMs.

*Christopher Chiu,Silviu Pitis,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VivaBench是一个多轮医学推理基准测试，评估LLM在不确定性下进行迭代诊断推理的能力，发现当前模型在需要主动探索信息时表现显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学基准主要评估知识回忆，而临床推理是假设驱动的迭代过程，需要从有限信息中逐步完善诊断。

Method: 构建1762个医生策划的临床案例作为交互式场景，模拟医学口试，要求AI主动探查相关发现、选择适当检查并在多步骤中综合信息。

Result: 当前LLM在完整临床描述下诊断能力良好，但在迭代推理中表现显著下降，出现四种常见认知错误模式。

Conclusion: VivaBench为评估对话式医学AI系统提供了标准化基准，揭示了当前LLM在不确定性下推理的根本局限性。

Abstract: Clinical reasoning in medicine is a hypothesis-driven process where
physicians refine diagnoses from limited information through targeted history,
physical examination, and diagnostic investigations. In contrast, current
medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge
recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is
provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn
benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our
dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as
interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training,
requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate
investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a
diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions
from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades
significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under
uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes
that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1)
fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3)
premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical
conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs
reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a
standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for
real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we
contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how
sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making
environments.

TL;DR: ECHO是一个提示框架，通过事后经验回放技术为语言模型代理生成优化的反事实轨迹，从失败尝试中创建合成正面示例，显著提升样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型代理在新环境中样本效率低，交互成本高，现有架构未能充分利用语言模型生成和推理完整反事实轨迹的能力。

Method: ECHO包含两个组件：事后规则（识别相关子目标并生成优化轨迹）和更新规则（维护压缩的轨迹表示）。

Result: 在XMiniGrid和PeopleJoinQA基准测试中，ECHO比基础语言代理性能提升高达80%，在XMiniGrid中优于Reflexion和AWM等复杂架构。

Conclusion: ECHO通过更有效地利用过去经验，实现了在新环境中更快的适应能力。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience
replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates
optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed
trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of
XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a
collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains,
ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid,
it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including
Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments
through more effective utilization of past experiences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了多视图图元组框架来解决GNN在稠密图上效率低下的问题，通过将图划分为不相交子图来捕获不同尺度的交互，并采用异构消息传递架构，在分子性质预测和宇宙学参数推断任务上优于单图基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在稠密图（如点云、分子相互作用）上效率低下，常用的图稀疏化方法需要人为选择单一交互尺度，会丢失其他尺度的关键信息。

Method: 引入多视图图元组框架，将图划分为不相交子图来捕获局部和长程连接，采用基于非交换算子理论的异构消息传递架构，证明其比单图消息传递模型更具表达性且具有更低的风险。

Result: 在分子性质预测（基于稀疏库仑矩阵）和宇宙学参数推断（基于几何点云）两个科学领域的应用中，多视图图元组模型比单图基线表现更好。

Conclusion: 多视图图元组方法能够有效处理稠密图，捕获多尺度交互信息，在科学计算任务中展现出强大的性能和通用性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges,
making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs,
such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify
the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an
arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information
from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view
graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework
partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local
interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view
representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing
architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we
formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk
compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework
on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce
Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point
clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate
better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and
versatility of our multi-view approach.

TL;DR: 开发了一种非侵入性生物标志物，通过分析单晚睡眠数据来检测抗抑郁药物的摄入情况，实现远程、无感的日常依从性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗抑郁药物不依从现象普遍存在，导致复发、住院、自杀风险增加和巨额可避免成本。现有方法要么具有侵入性，要么基于代理指标且不准确。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的模型分析来自消费级可穿戴设备或无接触无线传感器的睡眠数据，推断抗抑郁药物摄入情况。

Result: 在包含62,000个夜晚、>20,000名参与者（1,800名抗抑郁药物使用者）的六个数据集中，生物标志物AUROC达到0.84，能够跨药物类别泛化，随剂量变化，并对伴随精神药物保持稳健。纵向监测捕捉了真实世界的用药起始、减量和漏服情况。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了客观、可扩展的依从性监测，有潜力改善抑郁症护理和预后。

Abstract: Antidepressant nonadherence is pervasive, driving relapse, hospitalization,
suicide risk, and billions in avoidable costs. Clinicians need tools that
detect adherence lapses promptly, yet current methods are either invasive
(serum assays, neuroimaging) or proxy-based and inaccurate (pill counts,
pharmacy refills). We present the first noninvasive biomarker that detects
antidepressant intake from a single night of sleep. A transformer-based model
analyzes sleep data from a consumer wearable or contactless wireless sensor to
infer antidepressant intake, enabling remote, effortless, daily adherence
assessment at home. Across six datasets comprising 62,000 nights from >20,000
participants (1,800 antidepressant users), the biomarker achieved AUROC = 0.84,
generalized across drug classes, scaled with dose, and remained robust to
concomitant psychotropics. Longitudinal monitoring captured real-world
initiation, tapering, and lapses. This approach offers objective, scalable
adherence surveillance with potential to improve depression care and outcomes.

### [157] [Applying non-negative matrix factorization with covariates to label matrix for classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10375)
*Kenichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NMF-LAB是一种新的监督式非负矩阵分解方法，将分类问题重新定义为非负矩阵三因子分解的逆问题，直接从协变量映射到标签，无需外部分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NMF方法是无监督的，无法直接利用类别标签。现有的监督或半监督扩展方法通常通过惩罚项或图约束来整合标签，但仍需要外部分类器。

Method: NMF-LAB将标签矩阵Y作为观测值进行因子分解，而协变量A作为给定的解释变量。这种方法提供了从协变量到标签的直接概率映射，支持核相似度集成和半监督学习。

Result: 在从基准数据集到大规模MNIST数据集的各种实验中，NMF-LAB实现了有竞争力的预测准确性，对噪声或不完整标签具有鲁棒性，并能扩展到高维问题，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过在三因子NMF框架内统一回归和分类，NMF-LAB为现代分类任务提供了一种新颖、概率性和可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used for dimensionality
reduction and interpretable analysis, but standard formulations are
unsupervised and cannot directly exploit class labels. Existing supervised or
semi-supervised extensions usually incorporate labels only via penalties or
graph constraints, still requiring an external classifier. We propose
\textit{NMF-LAB} (Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Label Matrix), which
redefines classification as the inverse problem of non-negative matrix
tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Unlike joint NMF methods, which reconstruct both
features and labels, NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix $Y$ as the
observation, while covariates $A$ are treated as given explanatory variables.
This yields a direct probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels,
distinguishing our method from label-matrix factorization approaches that
mainly model label correlations or impute missing labels. Our inversion offers
two key advantages: (i) class-membership probabilities are obtained directly
from the factorization without a separate classifier, and (ii) covariates,
including kernel-based similarities, can be seamlessly integrated to generalize
predictions to unseen samples. In addition, unlabeled data can be encoded as
uniform distributions, supporting semi-supervised learning. Experiments on
diverse datasets, from small-scale benchmarks to the large-scale MNIST dataset,
demonstrate that NMF-LAB achieves competitive predictive accuracy, robustness
to noisy or incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional problems,
while preserving interpretability. By unifying regression and classification
within the tri-NMF framework, NMF-LAB provides a novel, probabilistic, and
scalable approach to modern classification tasks.

*Jiachi Zhao,Zehong Wang,Yamei Liao,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TreeDiff，一种基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的双空间扩散框架，用于可控图生成，解决了现有扩散模型在控制性和质量稳定性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图生成方法中，无条件扩散模型缺乏对期望属性的控制，导致质量不稳定且难以融入新目标；推理时引导方法虽然无需重新训练，但本质上是局部的、启发式的，控制能力有限。

Method: TreeDiff采用MCTS引导的双空间扩散框架，包含三个关键设计：宏步扩展策略（减少树深度）、双空间去噪机制（结合潜在空间去噪和图空间离散校正）、双空间验证器（预测长期奖励）。

Result: 在2D和3D分子生成基准测试中，TreeDiff在无条件和有条件设置下均达到最先进性能，且推理时间扩展性良好，能随计算资源增加持续改进。

Conclusion: TreeDiff是一种即插即用的推理时方法，通过扩展搜索空间同时保持计算可行性，显著提升了图生成的控制性和质量稳定性。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad
applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains
such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion
models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little
control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and
difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods
mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but
they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.
TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space
while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three
key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion
strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,
reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space
denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with
lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and
structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term
rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and
removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D
molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional
settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to
improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods
plateau early under limited resources.

TL;DR: 论文研究了transformer在上下文学习中的机制，发现在分类任务中transformer通过梯度下降在核特征空间中进行学习，且softmax注意力具有上下文自适应学习率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论研究主要关注线性自注意力和连续回归任务，而transformer通常在离散复杂任务上训练。本文旨在弥合这一差距，研究在分类任务中transformer的上下文学习算法。

Method: 通过理论分析研究transformer在分类任务中的学习机制，特别关注softmax激活函数的作用，并进行实证验证和消融实验。

Result: 发现transformer在分类任务中仍然通过梯度下降进行上下文学习，但在核特征空间中进行，且softmax transformer具有上下文自适应学习率。

Conclusion: 研究增强了在更现实场景下对上下文学习算法的理论理解，表明softmax注意力具有更强的上下文适应能力，为理解更大模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The remarkable ability of transformers to learn new concepts solely by
reading examples within the input prompt, termed in-context learning (ICL), is
a crucial aspect of intelligent behavior. Here, we focus on understanding the
learning algorithm transformers use to learn from context. Existing theoretical
work, often based on simplifying assumptions, has primarily focused on linear
self-attention and continuous regression tasks, finding transformers can learn
in-context by gradient descent. Given that transformers are typically trained
on discrete and complex tasks, we bridge the gap from this existing work to the
setting of classification, with non-linear (importantly, softmax) activation.
We find that transformers still learn to do gradient descent in-context, though
on functionals in the kernel feature space and with a context-adaptive learning
rate in the case of softmax transformer. These theoretical findings suggest a
greater adaptability to context for softmax attention, which we empirically
verify and study through ablations. Overall, we hope this enhances theoretical
understanding of in-context learning algorithms in more realistic settings,
pushes forward our intuitions and enables further theory bridging to larger
models.

TL;DR: HiLoMoE是一个分层LoRA MoE框架，通过参数高效的方式实现整体扩展，结合垂直和水平扩展的优势，在CTR预测任务中实现更好的性能-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度模型在CTR预测中面临的挑战：垂直扩展通过层堆叠提高模型表达能力，但顺序计算限制了高效扩展；水平扩展通过MoE实现高效扩展，但平坦的MoE层难以捕捉推荐任务中的层次结构。

Method: 提出HiLoMoE框架：使用轻量级rank-1专家进行参数高效的水平扩展；堆叠多个MoE层并采用分层路由实现组合多样的专家组合；基于前层分数而非输出进行路由，使所有层能够并行执行；采用三阶段训练框架确保稳定优化和专家多样性。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，HiLoMoE实现了更好的性能-效率权衡，与非MoE基线相比，平均AUC提升0.20%，FLOPs减少18.5%。

Conclusion: HiLoMoE通过结合垂直和水平扩展的优势，在参数高效的方式下实现了整体扩展，为CTR预测任务提供了更好的性能-效率平衡解决方案。

Abstract: Deep models have driven significant advances in click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. While vertical scaling via layer stacking improves model
expressiveness, the layer-by-layer sequential computation poses challenges to
efficient scaling. Conversely, horizontal scaling through Mixture of Experts
(MoE) achieves efficient scaling by activating a small subset of experts in
parallel, but flat MoE layers may struggle to capture the hierarchical
structure inherent in recommendation tasks. To push the Return-On-Investment
(ROI) boundary, we explore the complementary strengths of both directions and
propose HiLoMoE, a hierarchical LoRA MoE framework that enables holistic
scaling in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, HiLoMoE employs
lightweight rank-1 experts for parameter-efficient horizontal scaling, and
stacks multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing to enable combinatorially
diverse expert compositions. Unlike conventional stacking, HiLoMoE routes based
on prior layer scores rather than outputs, allowing all layers to execute in
parallel. A principled three-stage training framework ensures stable
optimization and expert diversity. Experiments on four public datasets show
that HiLoMoE achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoff, achieving an
average AUC improvement of 0.20\% in AUC and 18.5\% reduction in FLOPs compared
to the non-MoE baseline.

Result: 在ADNI数据集上的实验表明，MTL-FSL框架实现了最先进的性能，优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: MTL-FSL框架通过建模时变特征相关性，显著提升了阿尔茨海默病预测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in
aging populations, posing a significant and escalating burden on global
healthcare systems. While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful
computational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks
do not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity
Laplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel
Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the
time-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering
temporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features,
our model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To
solve the non-smooth optimization problem arising from our proposed penalty
terms, we adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed MTL-FSL framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在计算速度大幅提升（如量子计算或大规模并行硬件）的背景下，机器学习是否仍然需要人类的监督输入，以及生成式AI在其中的作用。

Method: 分析反向监督策略，即在大型未标记数据集上搜索标记以最小化小型标记数据集上的误差，研究其指数级复杂度问题。

Result: 即使计算速度大幅提升，机器学习仍然需要人类的初始输入来定义目标、类别和提供种子标注，生成式AI只能作为标签放大器来扩展人类监督。

Conclusion: 极端的计算速度可以减少实际运行时间，但不能减少学习的基本监督需求；初始的人类（或人类级别）输入仍然是必要的，以使系统基于预期任务。

Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a
large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The
search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even
under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel
hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster --
computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In
practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human
contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed
set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models
with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially
substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a
human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view,
generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small
human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while
humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing.
Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the
fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input
remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.

Abstract: Simulators of animal movements play a valuable role in studying behavior.
Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for
reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic
multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown
real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because
locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is
insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories
and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a
data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement
learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the
problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement
variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework.
We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states
between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies,
newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of
species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with
standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior
prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual
modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential
to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.

Conclusion: LightSAE框架有效解决了多变量时间序列预测中的表示瓶颈问题，在保持参数效率的同时显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous
multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
(MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing
methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all
channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures
valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce
a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into
a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific
auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we
\rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit
low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is
significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings.
Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that
operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization
and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related
datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness,
achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by
memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques
that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced
multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a
single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,
quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency
improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and
activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present
AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded
Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing
weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables
bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly,
bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism
incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary
codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are
enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ
structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible
overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly
narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains
competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x
over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By
aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a
practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse
service-level objectives.

### [166] [Anchor-based Maximum Discrepancy for Relative Similarity Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10477)
*Zhijian Zhou,Liuhua Peng,Xunye Tian,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于锚点的最大差异(AMD)方法，用于相对相似性测试，通过同时学习假设和核函数来解决传统方法中核选择与假设指定顺序的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于核的相对相似性测试方法存在核选择与假设指定顺序的挑战：一旦假设先被指定，总能找到使该假设被拒绝的核函数，这导致相对相似性测试在假设指定后选择核函数时变得不明确。

Method: 提出锚点最大差异(AMD)方法，将相对相似性定义为在深度核空间中(U,P)和(U,Q)距离的最大差异。测试分为两个阶段：第一阶段在深度核空间估计AMD并推断潜在假设；第二阶段评估潜在假设的统计显著性，提出统一测试框架为不同可能假设推导阈值。

Result: 通过理论验证和在基准数据集上的广泛实验，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AMD方法通过同时学习假设和核函数，有效解决了相对相似性测试中的核选择问题，提供了一种更合理的测试框架。

Abstract: The relative similarity testing aims to determine which of the distributions,
P or Q, is closer to an anchor distribution U. Existing kernel-based approaches
often test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified
alternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel
selection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the
manually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel
selection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified
first, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This
challenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select
a good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with
this challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously,
instead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We
propose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative
similarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U,
Q) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two
phases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer
the potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance
of the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to
derive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I.
Lastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness
via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Codes are publicly available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于结构的生成模型在生成具有足够合理性和可解释性的界面方面存在局限，需要开发能够生成真实功能性相互作用模式的方法。

Method: 在共享对比潜在空间中统一检索和生成，通过条件潜在扩散生成器识别相关界面并实现跨域界面转移。

Result: RADiAnce在多个指标上显著优于基线模型，包括结合亲和力以及几何结构和相互作用的恢复。跨域检索（如肽、抗体、蛋白质片段）提升了其他域结合剂的生成性能。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了蛋白质结合剂设计的新范式，成功桥接了基于检索的知识和生成式AI，为药物发现开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to
generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental
challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are
limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and
interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for
Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces
to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a
shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant
interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a
conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface
transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms
baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and
recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results
validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces
from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments,
enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges
retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug
discovery.

*Narayan S Iyer,Bivas Bhaumik,Ram S Iyer,Satyasaran Changdar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种梯度增强自训练PINN方法(gST-PINN)，通过梯度伪点自学习算法解决传统PINNs精度低、训练慢、缺乏标记数据和多物理场处理不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs存在精度有限、训练动态缓慢、缺乏标记数据以及多物理场交互处理不足等挑战，需要改进方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用梯度增强自训练PINN方法，引入基于梯度的伪点自学习算法，在三个不同类型的PDE问题上进行测试。

Result: gST-PINN在Burgers方程和扩散-吸附方程上分别达到10^{-5}量级的MSE，优于传统PINNs的10^{-3}和10^{-4}量级，且在没有标记数据的情况下仍能持续改进。

Conclusion: gST-PINN在纯半监督设置下始终优于标准PINN方法，能够有效解决低精度和收敛问题，特别是在缺乏标记数据的情况下。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical foundation for
simulating and understanding intricate behaviors in both physical sciences and
engineering. With the growing capabilities of deep learning, data$-$driven
approaches like Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been developed,
offering a mesh$-$free, analytic type framework for efficiently solving PDEs
across a wide range of applications. However, traditional PINNs often struggle
with challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of
labeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics
interactions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a
Gradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically
introduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving
PDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems
from various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$
equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the
diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after
12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In
contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease,
demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of
$10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the
proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the
standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are
unavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and
can be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence
issues, particularly in the absence of labeled data.

TL;DR: 提出了Align2Act框架，将指令调优的大型语言模型转化为可解释的规划器，使其与人类驾驶行为对齐，在nuPlan基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶中复杂场景的运动规划问题，探索LLM是否真正理解人类驾驶逻辑，并开发与人类行为对齐的可解释规划器。

Method: 基于人类推理模式和交通规则构建结构化驾驶指令，通过Align2ActChain模块进行逐步推理，使用LoRA在nuPlan数据集上对LLaMA-2-7B进行微调。

Result: 在Test14-random上获得85.17的开环分数和70.31（非反应式）、66.96（反应式）的闭环分数，在真实世界nuPlan闭环基准测试中显示出改进的规划质量和人类相似性。

Conclusion: 结构化推理显著提升了基于LLM的规划器性能，证明了将LLM转化为与人类行为对齐的可解释规划器的可行性。

Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous
driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data
to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language
models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs
truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning
framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners
aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on
human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and
traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our
Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an
interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with
LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an
open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and
66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or
open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness
on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that
structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM
planners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有影响力估计方法在训练随机性下不稳定，同一样本在不同训练中可能被评估为关键或无关，这影响了数据清理和模型调试的可靠性。

Method: 基于假设测试的f-influence框架，设计f-INE算法在单次训练中计算样本影响力，可扩展到大型语言模型如Llama-3.1-8B。

Result: f-INE能可靠检测引导模型意见的有毒样本，验证了其在数据清理和模型行为归因中的实用性。

Conclusion: f-influence框架解决了训练随机性带来的影响力估计不稳定问题，为可靠的数据清理和模型调试提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Influence estimation methods promise to explain and debug machine learning by
estimating the impact of individual samples on the final model. Yet, existing
methods collapse under training randomness: the same example may appear
critical in one run and irrelevant in the next. Such instability undermines
their use in data curation or cleanup since it is unclear if we indeed
deleted/kept the correct datapoints. To overcome this, we introduce
*f-influence* -- a new influence estimation framework grounded in hypothesis
testing that explicitly accounts for training randomness, and establish
desirable properties that make it suitable for reliable influence estimation.
We also design a highly efficient algorithm **f**-**IN**fluence **E**stimation
(**f-INE**) that computes f-influence **in a single training run**. Finally, we
scale up f-INE to estimate influence of instruction tuning data on Llama-3.1-8B
and show it can reliably detect poisoned samples that steer model opinions,
demonstrating its utility for data cleanup and attributing model behavior.

Abstract: Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data
scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR,
restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations
impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in
patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative
solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics
while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for
high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods:
noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling,
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a
reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key
innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full
histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative
refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature
dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and
Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves
Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around
0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores
surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%,
confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on
synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable
to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach
matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution
fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.

Abstract: Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) effectively bridges significant domain
shifts by progressively adapting from the source domain through intermediate
domains to the target domain. However, selecting intermediate domains without
explicit metadata remains a substantial challenge that has not been extensively
explored in existing studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement to
conduct domain path selection in an unsupervised CDA setting. Our approach
introduces an innovative unsupervised reward mechanism that leverages the
distances between latent domain embeddings to facilitate the identification of
optimal transfer paths. Furthermore, by disentangling features, our method
facilitates the calculation of unsupervised rewards using domain-specific
features and promotes domain adaptation by aligning domain-invariant features.
This integrated strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize transfer paths
and target task performance, enhancing the effectiveness of domain adaptation
processes. Extensive empirical evaluations on datasets such as Rotated MNIST
and ADNI demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and domain
selection efficiency, establishing our method's superiority over traditional
CDA approaches.

Method: 引入诊断套件和Oracle性能差距(OPG)指标，通过压力测试分析模型在分布偏移、难度变化和反事实场景下的泛化表现。

Result: 发现尽管基准分数很高，但现有强化学习方法在泛化方面存在严重缺陷，当前基准无法揭示这些问题。

Conclusion: 当前基准不足以评估泛化能力，提出了设计更可靠基准的三个核心原则：足够难度、平衡评估和分布鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating progress in reinforcement
learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs).Despite recent benchmark gains
reported for RL, we find that training on these benchmarks' training sets
achieves nearly the same performance as training directly on the test sets,
suggesting that the benchmarks cannot reliably separate further progress.To
study this phenomenon, we introduce a diagnostic suite and the Oracle
Performance Gap (OPG) metric that quantifies the performance difference between
training on the train split versus the test split of a benchmark. We further
analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong
benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across
distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual
scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that
current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose
three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient
difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.

Motivation: 传统时间序列模型缺乏病理特异性，难以捕捉与帕金森病高度相关的细微信号；同时PD症状的时间稀疏性导致关键诊断特征容易被传统聚合方法稀释。

Method: 提出多尺度频率感知对抗多实例网络（MFAM），包含医学先验知识指导的频率分解模块和基于注意力的多实例学习框架，能够自适应关注最具诊断价值的稀疏片段。

Conclusion: MFAM模型通过结合频率分解和多实例学习，有效提升了帕金森病严重程度评估的准确性和特异性，在临床时间序列分析中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Severity assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors offers
an effective, objective basis for clinical management. However, general-purpose
time series models often lack pathological specificity in feature extraction,
making it difficult to capture subtle signals highly correlated with
PD.Furthermore, the temporal sparsity of PD symptoms causes key diagnostic
features to be easily "diluted" by traditional aggregation methods, further
complicating assessment. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-scale
Frequency-Aware Adversarial Multi-Instance Network (MFAM). This model enhances
feature specificity through a frequency decomposition module guided by medical
prior knowledge. Furthermore, by introducing an attention-based multi-instance
learning (MIL) framework, the model can adaptively focus on the most
diagnostically valuable sparse segments.We comprehensively validated MFAM on
both the public PADS dataset for PD versus differential diagnosis (DD) binary
classification and a private dataset for four-class severity assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that MFAM outperforms general-purpose time
series models in handling complex clinical time series with specificity,
providing a promising solution for automated assessment of PD severity.

Conclusion: 该算法框架在现有方法的两个极端之间取得了平衡，允许代理在追求局部最优模型时相互受益，而无需强制共识。

Abstract: Classical consensus-based strategies for federated and decentralized learning
are statistically suboptimal in the presence of heterogeneous local data or
task distributions. As a result, in recent years, there has been growing
interest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents
to benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without
enforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge
of the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead
rely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an
algorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By
modeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an
unknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the
task relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a
way consistent with their individual data distributions. Our theoretical
analysis quantifies the quality of the learned relationship, and our numerical
experiments demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive empirical
success, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we
provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation
learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives.
Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular
contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying
principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype
representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and
improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show
how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices
in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of
balancing positive and negative pair interactions. All theoretical proofs are
provided in the appendix, and our code is included in the supplementary

Conclusion: 提出了基于对称性的预测编码框架，其中高层仅接收沿对称方向的粗粒度残差变换，为深度模型的组合性优势提供几何解释。

Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and
compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework
where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as
\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local)
actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically
complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the
agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show
that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} --
equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)
\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved
quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines
trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds
move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds
aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a
geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We
connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate
a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher
layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations}
(prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower
layers.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide potential for applications ranging
from medical rehabilitation to cognitive state assessment by establishing
direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices via
electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained
by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the
generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings.
To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation
framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By
integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and
combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction
pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited
data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG
datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing
augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification
accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在有限预算下优化探索中间模型空间的方法，将其形式化为Lipschitz空间中未知值函数的预算分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建学习模型时经常需要评估大量中间模型，如特征选择、模型结构搜索和参数调优过程中的模型。中间模型的评估结果会影响后续模型探索决策，但真实性能只有在评估后才能知道。

Method: 将问题形式化为Lipschitz空间中未知值函数的一般预算分配问题。

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体结果。

Conclusion: 解决了在有限预算下最优分配资源来探索中间模型空间的挑战。

Abstract: Building learning models frequently requires evaluating numerous intermediate
models. Examples include models considered during feature selection, model
structure search, and parameter tunings. The evaluation of an intermediate
model influences subsequent model exploration decisions. Although prior
knowledge can provide initial quality estimates, true performance is only
revealed after evaluation. In this work, we address the challenge of optimally
allocating a bounded budget to explore the space of intermediate models. We
formalize this as a general budget allocation problem over unknown-value
functions within a Lipschitz space.

Motivation: 股票价格预测具有挑战性，传统GAN存在模式崩溃、训练不稳定、难以捕捉时空特征相关性等问题，限制了其在金融领域的应用。

Method: 使用基于GRU的编码器-解码器框架，引入残差连接的时间解码器进行精确重构，结合静态和动态协变量进行条件学习，采用窗口机制捕捉时间动态。

Conclusion: EDGAN模型在表达能力和简单性之间取得了良好平衡，显著优于传统GAN变体，在股票预测领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Forecasting stock prices remains challenging due to the volatile and
non-linear nature of financial markets. Despite the promise of deep learning,
issues such as mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty in capturing
temporal and feature level correlations have limited the applications of GANs
in this domain. We propose a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN (EDGAN) model that
strikes a balance between expressive power and simplicity. The model introduces
key innovations such as a temporal decoder with residual connections for
precise reconstruction, conditioning on static and dynamic covariates for
contextual learning, and a windowing mechanism to capture temporal dynamics.
Here, the generator uses a dense encoder-decoder framework with residual GRU
blocks. Extensive experiments on diverse stock datasets demonstrate that EDGAN
achieves superior forecasting accuracy and training stability, even in volatile
markets. It consistently outperforms traditional GAN variants in forecasting
accuracy and convergence stability under market conditions.

Motivation: 锂离子电池在能量供应中应用日益广泛，但其容量随充放电循环次数增加而下降的问题威胁着储能系统的耐久性。现有方法对每个循环中电池状态信息的利用不足。

Method: 使用半参数深度高斯过程回归框架SDG-L，结合LSTM特征提取器对时间序列电池状态数据进行建模，充分利用充放电过程中的辅助特征信息。

Result: 在NASA数据集上的实验表明，该方法平均测试MSE误差为1.2%，优于现有方法，并通过消融研究验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: SDG-L框架能够有效利用电池状态信息进行容量预测，为锂离子电池储能系统的效率和可靠性提供了保障。

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly omnipresent in energy supply.
However, the durability of energy storage using lithium-ion batteries is
threatened by their dropping capacity with the growing number of
charging/discharging cycles. An accurate capacity prediction is the key to
ensure system efficiency and reliability, where the exploitation of battery
state information in each cycle has been largely undervalued. In this paper, we
propose a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework named SDG-L
to give predictions based on the modeling of time series battery state data. By
introducing an LSTM feature extractor, the SDG-L is specially designed to
better utilize the auxiliary profiling information during charging/discharging
process. In experimental studies based on NASA dataset, our proposed method
obtains an average test MSE error of 1.2%. We also show that SDG-L achieves
better performance compared to existing works and validate the framework using
ablation studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpMIA是一种基于神经网络隐式偏差的白盒成员推理攻击方法，无需依赖参考模型，在仅知道模型权重和训练数据超集的情况下实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的黑盒成员推理攻击方法依赖不现实的假设：攻击者知道训练超参数、非训练样本与训练数据同分布、评估集中训练数据比例已知。这些假设在实际中很少成立，导致攻击性能显著下降。

Method: ImpMIA利用神经网络的最大间隔隐式偏差理论，基于KKT最优性条件识别训练样本。通过寻找梯度最能重构训练模型参数的样本来实现攻击。

Result: ImpMIA在仅提供模型权重和训练数据超集的现实场景下，相比黑盒和白盒攻击方法都实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 基于隐式偏差的ImpMIA方法消除了对参考模型和不现实假设的依赖，为成员推理攻击提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质结构表示方法面临SE(3)流形复杂性、离散标记化需求或多训练目标等挑战，这些因素阻碍了模型优化和泛化能力。

Method: 使用具有瓶颈设计的非等变扩散变换器，通过单一流匹配目标进行端到端训练，将蛋白质主链坐标从E(3)映射到连续紧凑潜在空间。

Result: ProteinAE实现了最先进的重建质量，优于现有自编码器。其潜在空间作为潜在扩散模型的基础，能够高效生成高质量结构，与领先的结构方法竞争并显著优于先前的潜在方法。

Conclusion: ProteinAE提供了一种简化的蛋白质结构表示学习框架，通过连续潜在空间和单一训练目标，在重建和生成任务上都表现出色，为蛋白质科学提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for
advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling.
Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold,
rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives,
all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce
ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to
overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from
E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a
non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient
compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective,
substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that
ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming
existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful
foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit
equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is
competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly
outperforms prior latent-based methods. Code is available at

Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative
models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs
(hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic
plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we
present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical
plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines
in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering
out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of
high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination
of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and
existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture
different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled
retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis
systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic
paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we
compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends
in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly
applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain.
By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol,
we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

Abstract: Control Co-Design (CCD) integrates physical and control system design to
improve the performance of dynamic and autonomous systems. Despite advances in
uncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly
unpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering
the full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs
the design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in
robustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens
this paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the
lifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive
re-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and
controller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers
to continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending
this approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each
cycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT
models, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and
inform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The
framework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled
learning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more
stable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly
enhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this
work include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation
framework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed
design, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.

Motivation: 现有股票预测方法主要关注单一状态的关系建模，忽略了动态和静态股票关系之间的互补性，这限制了预测性能。

Method: 使用双关系融合网络，包含相对静态关系组件建模长期模式，通过距离感知机制捕捉动态关系，并通过循环融合前一天动态关系与预定义静态关系来演化长期结构。

Conclusion: 同时建模动态和静态股票关系能够有效提升股价预测性能，证明了两种关系互补性的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of inter-stock relationships is critical for stock price
forecasting. However, existing methods predominantly focus on single-state
relationships, neglecting the essential complementarity between dynamic and
static inter-stock relations. To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Relation
Fusion Network (DRFN) to capture the long-term relative stability of stock
relation structures while retaining the flexibility to respond to sudden market
shifts. Our approach features a novel relative static relation component that
models time-varying long-term patterns and incorporates overnight informational
influences. We capture dynamic inter-stock relationships through distance-aware
mechanisms, while evolving long-term structures via recurrent fusion of dynamic
relations from the prior day with the pre-defined static relations. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines across
different markets, with high sensitivity to the co-movement of relational
strength and stock price.

Abstract: Accurate climate forecasting is vital for Bangladesh, a region highly
susceptible to climate change impacts on temperature and rainfall. Existing
models often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal
patterns in climate data. This study introduces an advanced Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model integrated with an attention mechanism to enhance the
prediction of temperature and rainfall dynamics. Utilizing comprehensive
datasets from 1901-2023, sourced from NASA's POWER Project for temperature and
the Humanitarian Data Exchange for rainfall, the model effectively captures
seasonal and long-term trends. It outperforms baseline models, including
XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, achieving a test MSE of 0.2411 (normalized
units), MAE of 0.3860 degrees C, R^2 of 0.9834, and NRMSE of 0.0370 for
temperature, and MSE of 1283.67 mm^2, MAE of 22.91 mm, R^2 of 0.9639, and NRMSE
of 0.0354 for rainfall on monthly forecasts. The model demonstrates improved
robustness with only a 20 percent increase in MSE under simulated climate
trends (compared to an approximately 2.2-fold increase in baseline models
without trend features) and a 50 percent degradation under regional variations
(compared to an approximately 4.8-fold increase in baseline models without
enhancements). These results highlight the model's ability to improve
forecasting precision and offer potential insights into the physical processes
governing climate variability in Bangladesh, supporting applications in
climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant
applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured
data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been
increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the
original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative
networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain
unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and
construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a
given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given
rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an
alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,
ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d
from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )
and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for
generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,
the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree
edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN
and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced
significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%
and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards
construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and
valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed
networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.

TL;DR: 提出Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs)方法，通过渐进式深度扩展训练策略，为不同复杂度的数据集自动选择最优网络深度，减少计算资源浪费和内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常以全深度训练，但并非所有数据集都需要如此高的模型容量，导致计算资源浪费、能耗过高和内存占用过大，难以在资源受限设备上部署。

Method: 采用类似NAS的训练策略——渐进式深度扩展，从较浅深度开始训练网络，随着早期模块收敛逐步增加深度，直到达到目标精度，仅使用数据集所需的最优深度。

Result: 在MNIST和SVHN数据集上，ResNet-18和ResNet-34的最优深度分别实现了98.64%和96.44%的内存占用减少，同时保持99.31%和96.08%的竞争性准确率。

Conclusion: ODNs方法能够有效平衡模型深度与任务复杂度，显著降低训练和推理成本，提高计算效率，便于在边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

Motivation: 扩散模型在RLHF微调中存在训练时使用随机SDE采样器与推理时使用确定性ODE采样器的不匹配，这会导致奖励差距，影响推理时的输出质量。

Method: 采用广义去噪扩散隐式模型(gDDIM)框架支持任意高随机性，保持数据边际分布；通过理论分析推导奖励差距的边界，并在文本到图像模型上进行大规模实验验证。

Result: 理论分析为非真空边界提供了保证，实证结果表明奖励差距在训练过程中持续缩小，使用更高随机性的SDE训练能提升ODE采样质量。

Conclusion: 训练与推理采样器不匹配导致的奖励差距问题可以通过理论分析和适当的方法得到有效缓解，高随机性训练有助于提升推理质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to
fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch
between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers
used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE
samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on
deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy
induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can
be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this
reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along
with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance
Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized
denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily
high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout.
Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image
models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group
relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently
narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated
using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

Abstract: In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to
modeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock
dependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages
during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an
attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic
context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing.
Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling
rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range
multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to
weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal
dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms
existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating
strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架，通过预条件矩阵范数泛化了最速下降法、拟牛顿法和自适应方法，揭示了SGD、Adam等优化器都是该原理的特例。基于此框架引入了两种新方法MuAdam和MuAdam-SANIA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化方法面临几何适应性和曲率利用之间的权衡：最速下降法适应不同几何但仅为一阶方法，拟牛顿法和自适应优化器利用曲率信息但受限于Frobenius几何。需要统一框架来克服这些限制。

Method: 提出基于预条件矩阵范数的统一框架，将最速下降法、拟牛顿法和自适应方法统一起来。在该框架下系统处理了矩阵参数化设置中的仿射和尺度不变性，并引入了结合Muon谱几何和Adam风格预条件的新方法MuAdam和MuAdam-SANIA。

Conclusion: 该统一框架为理解各种优化器提供了新视角，提出的新方法展示了在几何适应性和曲率利用方面的优势。

Abstract: Optimization lies at the core of modern deep learning, yet existing methods
often face a fundamental trade-off between adapting to problem geometry and
leveraging curvature utilization. Steepest descent algorithms adapt to
different geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order,
whereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information
but are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across
diverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework
generalizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods
through the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction
reveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more
advanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP
and SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this
framework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale
invariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and
sufficient conditions under generalized norms. Building on this foundation, we
introduce two new methods, $\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which
combine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our
experiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some
cases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Result: 在合成和真实世界任务中评估，相比其他架构表现出更优的性能和更强的可解释性。

Conclusion: BioOSS成功模拟了神经处理中关键的波状传播动力学，为构建更接近生物神经行为的计算模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models,
which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological
neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their
closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the
intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In
this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS)
designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural
processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity
patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p
neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by
pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation
velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local
interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model
incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling
flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate
BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior
performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative
architectures.

Motivation: 尽管LSTM和Transformer等深度学习模型在水文应用中表现出色，但它们在预测受自然变异和人类活动等多种因素主导的陆地水储量方面的优势尚不明确。

Method: 使用HydroGlobe数据集（包括仅来自陆面模型模拟的基准版本和结合多源遥感数据同化的高级版本），比较线性回归、LSTM和时序融合Transformer在TWS预测中的性能。

Result: 线性回归是一个稳健的基准，在TWS预测中表现优于更复杂的LSTM和时序融合Transformer模型。

Conclusion: 在开发和评估深度学习模型时，包含传统统计模型作为基准至关重要，同时需要建立能够捕捉自然变异和人类干预综合影响的全球代表性基准数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
models and Transformers have been widely adopted in hydrological applications,
demonstrating impressive performance amongst deep learning models and
outperforming physical models in various tasks. However, their superiority in
predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are
dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven
modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally
representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived
solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version
incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that
linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM
and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the
importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when
developing and evaluating deep learning models. Additionally, we emphasize the
critical need to establish globally representative benchmark datasets that
capture the combined impact of natural variability and human interventions.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune
graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into
spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying
explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding
of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an
optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the
training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This
integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error
while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model
searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important
elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed
approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy
obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments
demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of
information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used.
These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing
models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their
most important elements.

*Ali Atiah Alzahrani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARCD是一个结合了制度条件生成场景和CVaR分配器的投资组合决策框架，通过隐马尔可夫模型推断潜在制度、使用尾部加权扩散模型生成危机场景，在严格的前向测试中显著改善了回撤控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在制度转换环境下，通过制度条件的生成场景结合凸CVaR分配器是否能改善投资组合决策，特别是提升尾部风险管理和回撤控制能力。

Method: 提出MARCD方法：1) 使用高斯HMM推断潜在制度；2) 训练带有尾部加权目标和制度专业化MoE去噪器的扩散模型来丰富危机联动；3) 将生成场景输入考虑换手率的CVaR对偶二次规划进行分配。

Result: 在2005-2025年流动性多资产ETF的严格前向测试中，MARCD表现优于标准分配器，2020-2025年样本外测试显示夏普比率1.23（基准1.02），最大回撤9.3%（基准14.1%），回撤减少34%，夏普提升在5%水平显著。

Conclusion: MARCD提供了一个从尾部忠实场景建模到受治理投资组合决策的可复现桥梁，显著改善了回撤控制，并提供了理论保证支持该方法在谱风险控制和分配器性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a
convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We
introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers
latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a
tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE)
denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios
into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance.
In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD
outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular
generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains
Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent
reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals
indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory
linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the
decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE
denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator. Together, MARCD
offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed
portfolio decisions with materially improved drawdown control.

<details>

Motivation: 数据共享生态系统中，由于隐私问题，数据提供者通常会对数据集进行匿名化处理，但不同的掩码配置会导致不同的数据效用。关键挑战在于高效确定能最大化数据集效用的最优掩码配置。

Method: 提出基于迭代比例拟合的联合分布估计器，利用有限的数据摘要（如1D直方图）或无数据来估计特征-标签联合分布，支持多种特征-标签相关性量化方法（g3、互信息、卡方检验）。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验评估表明，AEGIS识别最优掩码配置的速度比基线方法快一个数量级，同时产生的掩码数据集在下游机器学习任务中达到与基线方法相当的预测性能。

Conclusion: AEGIS框架能够高效识别最优掩码配置，在保护隐私的同时保持数据效用，适用于原始数据因隐私限制而无法访问的场景。

Abstract: Data-sharing ecosystems enable entities -- such as providers, consumers, and
intermediaries -- to access, exchange, and utilize data for various downstream
tasks and applications. Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically
anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple
masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility.
Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal
masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents
AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration
for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We
introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a
metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after
masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms)
or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable
for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To
achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative
proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation
quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our
experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies
optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the
resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks
that is on par with baseline approaches.

TL;DR: 提出GLANCE框架，通过轻量级路由器选择性调用LLM来增强GNN在特定节点上的预测性能，特别是在异配性节点上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-GNN融合策略对所有节点统一应用，性能提升有限。研究发现GNN和LLM在不同结构模式上表现各异，需要节点感知的自适应融合方法。

Method: GLANCE框架包含轻量级路由器，基于廉价节点信号决定是否查询LLM。路由器通过优势目标训练，比较查询LLM与仅依赖GNN的效用。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GLANCE在节点子组间实现最佳性能平衡，异配性节点性能提升高达13%，同时保持整体最佳性能。

Conclusion: 自适应、节点感知的GNN-LLM架构具有重要价值，选择性调用LLM可在大型图上实现可扩展部署，避免高计算成本。

Abstract: Learning on text-attributed graphs has motivated the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for graph learning. However, most fusion strategies are applied
uniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We
argue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide
benefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we
reframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show
that performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each
excelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage
this finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and
Context-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's
prediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive
per-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are
non-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective
that compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the
GNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance
across node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up
to $+13\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our
findings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures,
where selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs
without incurring high computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习策略在单独训练时，即使各自表现良好，但在实际系统中共同部署时可能仍达不到最优性能。缓存替换和预取策略之间存在双向依赖关系，需要联合训练。

Method: 提出了基于共享特征表示的联合学习方法，包括两种具体实现：基于联合编码器的方法和基于对比学习的嵌入方法。

Result: 两种方法都展示了有希望的初步结果，证明了联合训练的有效性。

Conclusion: 缓存替换和预取策略应该联合训练，本文为这一研究方向制定了未来研究议程。

Abstract: Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for
scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By
leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting
future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing
workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained
in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In
this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching --
for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two
policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the
two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared
representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two
approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint
encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and
demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay
down an agenda for future research in this direction.

Abstract: Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted
significant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach
- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for
heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph
heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response
varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic
correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed
filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve
expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a
heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily
degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters
to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals
that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not
follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to
guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a
simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily
spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD
NAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over
leading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing
field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based
methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved
promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of
single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and
frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with
Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE.
LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It
further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and
distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates
time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that
integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion
yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm
for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.
By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in
various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on
either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent
interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim
agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising
results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two
major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and
dependent on interactions with victim agents.
  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we
redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead
well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these
agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a
neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open
systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim
agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate
our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the
autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial
attacks in multi-party open systems.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial because its
neurodegenerative effects are irreversible, and neuropathologic and
social-behavioral risk factors accumulate years before diagnosis. Identifying
higher-risk individuals earlier enables prevention, timely care, and equitable
resource allocation. We predict cognitive performance from social determinants
of health (SDOH) using the NIH NIA-supported PREPARE Challenge Phase 2 dataset
derived from the nationally representative Mex-Cog cohort of the 2003 and 2012
Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).
  Data: The target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven
domains-orientation, memory, attention, language, constructional praxis, and
executive function-derived from the 2016 and 2021 MHAS waves. Predictors span
demographic, socioeconomic, health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and healthcare
access factors.
  Methodology: Missingness was addressed with a singular value decomposition
(SVD)-based imputation pipeline treating continuous and categorical variables

missing values while balancing reliability and scalability. After evaluating
multiple methods, XGBoost was chosen for its superior predictive performance.

TL;DR: MC#框架通过结合静态量化和动态专家剪枝，对MoE-LLMs/VLMs进行激进压缩，在保持性能的同时显著减少存储和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE模型中预加载所有专家和激活多个专家带来的显著计算和内存开销问题，专家模块是模型大小和推理成本的主要贡献者。

Method: 提出PMQ（预加载混合精度量化）通过线性规划优化位分配，平衡专家重要性和量化误差；OTP（在线任意剪枝）使用Gumbel-Softmax采样动态选择专家子集。

Result: 在DeepSeek-VL2上实现6.2倍权重压缩（平均2.57位），仅1.7%精度损失；OTP减少20%以上专家激活，性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: MC#通过静态位宽优化和动态路由的结合，实现了极端压缩且精度损失最小，展示了高效部署MoE模型的强大潜力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) by increasing capacity through sparse activation.
However, preloading all experts into memory and activating multiple experts per
input introduces significant computational and memory overhead, making the
expert module a major contributor to model size and inference cost. To address
this, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines
static quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance
of experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce
storage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision
Quantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming,
balancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal
trade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online
Top-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a
subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By
combining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC#
achieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss. On DeepSeek-VL2, MC#
achieves a 6.2 times weight reduction at 2.57 average bits with only a 1.7%
accuracy drop across five multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, OTP reduces
expert activation over 20% with less than 1% performance degradation,
demonstrating strong potential for efficient MoE-based model deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自适应边界的奖励模型增强方法，通过最优传输理论动态调整对困难样本的关注，显著提升了奖励模型的性能、收敛速度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Bradley-Terry奖励模型在处理相似偏好响应时区分能力不足，容易过拟合简单样本且泛化能力差，特别是在分布外样本上表现不佳。

Method: 设计了一种自适应边界机制，基于语义相似度和模型预测奖励差异，从分布角度通过最优传输理论动态调整奖励模型对困难样本的关注。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法优于现有奖励模型技术，在分布内和分布外设置下均表现出更好的性能，RLHF实验也验证了其在实际对齐大语言模型中的有效性。

Conclusion: 自适应边界机制通过最优传输理论有效提升了奖励模型的区分能力和泛化性能，为基于人类偏好对齐大语言模型提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: The reward model (RM) plays a crucial role in aligning Large Language Models
(LLMs) with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning, where the
Bradley-Terry (BT) objective has been recognized as simple yet powerful,
specifically for pairwise preference learning. However, BT-based RMs often
struggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses,
leading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs.
Consequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well
to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to
BT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to
dynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins,
based on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which
is approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport
(OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design,
our adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences
between chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in
performance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Experimental
results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
several existing RM techniques, showcasing enhanced performance in both
In-Distribution (ID) and OOD settings. Moreover, RLHF experiments support our
practical effectiveness in better aligning LLMs with human preferences. Our

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 4-bit量化在推理模型中并非最优选择，KV缓存比模型大小更影响内存。研究发现存在规模依赖的权衡：小模型应优先模型容量，大模型应优先生成长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4-bit量化作为内存最优选择的通用方案在推理模型中失效，因为KV缓存而非模型大小主导内存使用。

Method: 在AIME25和GPQA-Diamond数据集上进行1700个推理场景的系统实验，分析不同规模模型的KV缓存与模型权重的内存分配权衡。

Result: 发现规模依赖的阈值：8-bit 4B参数以下的小模型通过分配更多内存给权重获得更好精度，而更大模型通过分配内存给更长生成长度获得更好精度。

Conclusion: 推理模型的内存优化不能与规模无关，小模型应优先模型容量，大模型应最大化推理时计算。推理模型的部署优化策略与非推理模型有根本不同。

Abstract: While 4-bit quantization has emerged as a memory-optimal choice for
non-reasoning models and zero-shot tasks across scales, we show that this
universal prescription fails for reasoning models, where the KV cache rather
than model size can dominate memory. Through systematic experiments across
1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, we find a scale-dependent
trade-off: models with an effective size below 8-bit 4B parameters achieve
better accuracy by allocating memory to more weights rather than longer
generation, while larger models achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to
longer generations. This scale threshold also determines when parallel scaling
becomes memory-efficient and whether KV cache eviction outperforms KV
quantization. Our findings show that memory optimization for LLMs cannot be
scale-agnostic, while providing principled guidelines: for small reasoning
models, prioritize model capacity over test-time compute, while for larger
ones, maximize test-time compute. Our results suggest that optimizing reasoning
models for deployment requires fundamentally different strategies from those
established for non-reasoning models.

Motivation: 现有方法要么扰动数据使其不可学习，要么重新训练模型抑制迁移，但都无法控制未知模型的推理，且通常需要控制训练过程。需要一种能在保持数据有用性的同时防止滥用的机制。

Method: 在模型特定低敏感性子空间中重新编码输入，保持授权模型的输出，同时通过子空间不对齐降低未授权模型的性能。使用Hoffman-Wielandt不等式将性能下降与谱差异联系起来。

Result: 经验证明NEs在各种视觉骨干网络和最先进的视觉语言模型上保持性能，而非目标模型即使尝试重建也会性能崩溃。

Conclusion: NEs是一种实用的方法，既能保持预期数据效用，又能防止未经授权的利用。

Abstract: Recent AI regulations call for data that remain useful for innovation while
resistant to misuse, balancing utility with protection at the model level.
Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain
models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models,
and both typically require control over training. We propose non-transferable
examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control
mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace,
preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on
unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds
that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for
unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to
spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision
backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common
preprocessing, whereas non-target models collapse even with reconstruction
attempts. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended
data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation. Our project is

Conclusion: 指令感知的用户建模能够有效实现指令引导的用户信息去噪，为更通用和鲁棒的用户表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: User representation modeling has become increasingly crucial for personalized
applications, yet existing approaches struggle with generalizability across
domains and sensitivity to noisy behavioral signals. We present InstructUE, an
instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations.
InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter
that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while
preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel
contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and
representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The
contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages
autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and
contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space,
thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user
embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we
demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across
multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation
scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can
effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user
representation learning.

TL;DR: 提出了EasyCore核心集选择算法，通过保留低平均输入梯度范数(AIGN)的样本进行训练，显著提升模型对抗鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择算法主要关注清洁准确率，无法有效保持对抗鲁棒性。需要从数据中心视角理解哪些样本对学习鲁棒特征最为关键

Method: 将样本的对抗脆弱性与"难度"联系起来，用训练过程中的平均输入梯度范数(AIGN)量化样本难度。EasyCore算法仅保留低AIGN的简单样本进行训练

Result: 在标准训练和TRADES对抗训练下，EasyCore相比现有核心集方法分别实现了7%和5%的对抗准确率提升

Conclusion: AIGN是模型无关的数据集属性，EasyCore是一种高效且广泛适用的数据中心方法，可显著改善对抗鲁棒性

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

<details>

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成过程中会累积误差，特别是在应用任意引导时，这会破坏样本保真度，出现离流形现象。

Method: 使用时间预测器估计每个时间步的流形偏差，设计TAG引导机制在生成过程中将样本吸引回期望流形。

Result: TAG能持续产生与期望流形对齐的样本，在各种下游任务中显著改善生成质量。

Conclusion: TAG是一种通用解决方案，能有效解决扩散模型中的离流形问题，提升引导生成的质量和保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models.
However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the
generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary
guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often
breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address
the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach
leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data
manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated
with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism,
`Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired
manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the
desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in
generation quality across various downstream tasks.

Motivation: 多智能体系统和强化学习被广泛用于增强大语言模型的智能能力，但将在线策略强化学习应用于多智能体系统仍存在算法和系统层面的挑战。

Method: 提出了AT-GRPO方法，包括：(i) 针对多智能体系统定制的智能体和回合分组强化学习算法；(ii) 支持单策略和多策略模型的训练系统。

Result: 在长期规划任务中，准确率从单智能体强化学习基线的14.0-47.0%提升到96.0-99.5%；在编码任务上平均提升3.87-7.62%，在数学任务上平均提升9.0-17.93%。

Conclusion: AT-GRPO在多智能体系统中有效解决了强化学习应用的技术挑战，显著提升了各种任务类型的性能表现。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to
enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves
task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental
rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However,
applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique
challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down
because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must
support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and
multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL
algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single-
and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks,
AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases
accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5
percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to
7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math. Code and

Conclusion: TED为边缘设备提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，能够在真实世界边缘应用中实现高效、无遗忘的自适应，具有最小内存和计算开销。

Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational
resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine
learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on
gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently
unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on
backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives
address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack
flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge
devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the
principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only
enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to
the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is
achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and
enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and
computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword
spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets
demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while
$\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a
practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore,
we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$,
demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge
devices in real-world deployments.

Conclusion: CDRL4AD能够有效检测异常并识别因果关系，案例研究显示该方法有助于人类专家诊断异常的根本原因。

Abstract: Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate
detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic
interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of
causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence
between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture
feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their
representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over
different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled
Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and
identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we
design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and
causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal
relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to
infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms
of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates
hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct
a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the
root causes of anomalies.

Abstract: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal-based
medical applications owing to hardware constraints or motion artifacts.
However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities,
resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any
modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust
framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality
conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach
that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a
Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each
physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs
missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The
experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and
generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting
clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data

Conclusion: 专用小型LLM经过精心微调可以超越大型通用模型，为组合优化问题提供更高效的启发式设计解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated
heuristic designers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), current
state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on prompting massive,
general-purpose models like GPT-4. This work challenges that paradigm by
demonstrating that a smaller, specialized LLM, when meticulously fine-tuned,
can generate components that surpass expert-crafted heuristics within advanced
solvers. We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
Fine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for
the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP).
Our method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that
progressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then
executable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert
designs. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages
plagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments
show that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly
outperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains
consistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems
with up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading
neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such
as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

Motivation: 热成像面部关键点检测在复杂光照条件下很重要，但缺乏丰富的视觉线索。传统的跨模态方法计算成本高或引入结构伪影，限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出多级跨模态知识蒸馏(MLCM-KD)框架，包含双向注入知识蒸馏(DIKD)。DIKD不仅用RGB特征指导学生，还将学生学到的表征反馈给冻结的教师预测头，形成闭环监督。

Result: 在公开热成像FLD基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，显著优于先前方法，同时大幅减少计算开销。

Conclusion: 该方法通过双向知识蒸馏有效解决了RGB和热成像数据之间的模态差异问题，实现了鲁棒且深入的知识迁移。

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: 通过因果修剪方法可以有效提升模型在测试时对分布偏移的适应能力。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to improve model robustness under distribution
shifts by adapting models with access to unlabeled target samples. A primary
cause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on
features that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We
introduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that
identifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test
distributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features
while varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations
using Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance
directions associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by
removing their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed
representations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously
tracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal
features. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and
empirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks. TACT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

Abstract: To adapt kernel two-sample and independence testing to complex structured
data, aggregation of multiple kernels is frequently employed to boost testing
power compared to single-kernel tests. However, we observe a phenomenon that
directly maximizing multiple kernel-based statistics may result in highly
similar kernels that capture highly overlapping information, limiting the
effectiveness of aggregation. To address this, we propose an aggregated
statistic that explicitly incorporates kernel diversity based on the covariance
between different kernels. Moreover, we identify a fundamental challenge: a
trade-off between the diversity among kernels and the test power of individual
kernels, i.e., the selected kernels should be both effective and diverse. This
motivates a testing framework with selection inference, which leverages
information from the training phase to select kernels with strong individual
performance from the learned diverse kernel pool. We provide rigorous
theoretical statements and proofs to show the consistency on the test power and
control of Type-I error, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed
statistics. Lastly, we conducted extensive empirical experiments demonstrating
the superior performance of our proposed approach across various benchmarks for
both two-sample and independence testing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的基于预测的时间序列异常检测框架，在58个数据集上系统评估了经典方法和深度学习方法的性能，发现LSTM表现最佳，预测质量对检测性能起主导作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列异常检测方法缺乏系统性的跨领域评估，需要建立一个统一的框架来比较不同方法的性能。

Method: 构建模块化流水线，集成预处理、四种预测模型和四种检测方法，使用残差检测接口，在Numenta异常基准上进行全面评估。

Result: LSTM表现最佳（F1: 0.688），在81%的数据集上排名第一或第二；Informer提供竞争性精度（F1: 0.683）且训练速度快30%；经典方法在简单数据上成本低60%但在真实数据上F1分数差2-3倍。

Conclusion: 预测质量主导检测性能，建议根据场景选择：复杂模式用LSTM，效率关键用Informer，简单周期数据用经典方法。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for modern digital infrastructures,
yet existing methods lack systematic cross-domain evaluation. We present a
comprehensive forecasting-based framework unifying classical methods
(Holt-Winters, SARIMA) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, Informer) under
a common residual-based detection interface. Our modular pipeline integrates
preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models, four
detection methods, and dual evaluation through forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE,
PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). We conduct the first
complete evaluation on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (58 datasets, 7
categories) with 232 model training runs and 464 detection evaluations
achieving 100\% success rate. LSTM achieves best performance (F1: 0.688,
ranking first or second on 81\% of datasets) with exceptional correlation on
complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer provides competitive accuracy (F1:
0.683) with 30\% faster training. Classical methods achieve perfect predictions
on simple synthetic data with 60 lower cost but show 2-3 worse F1-scores on
real-world datasets. Forecasting quality dominates detection performance:
differences between detection methods (F1: 0.621-0.688) are smaller than
between forecasting models (F1: 0.344-0.688). Our findings provide
evidence-based guidance: use LSTM for complex patterns, Informer for
efficiency-critical deployments, and classical methods for simple periodic data
with resource constraints. The complete implementation and results establish
baselines for future forecasting-based anomaly detection research.

TL;DR: 该论文通过系统动力学分析发现，强化学习（RL）和监督学习（SL）在相同决策任务中驱动循环神经网络（RNN）产生根本不同的计算策略。RL自发发现混合吸引子架构，而SL主要收敛到简单的固定点解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解学习算法如何塑造神经网络中出现的计算策略是机器智能的基本挑战。虽然网络架构受到广泛关注，但学习范式本身在决定涌现动态中的作用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用系统动力学分析，比较RL和SL训练的RNN在相同决策任务中的计算解决方案。分析网络动态特性、吸引子架构和神经群体功能平衡。

Result: RL自发发现混合吸引子架构，结合稳定固定点吸引子用于决策维持和准周期吸引子用于灵活证据整合。RL通过隐式正则化塑造功能平衡的神经群体，增强鲁棒性。SL则收敛到更简单的固定点解决方案，产生更异质的网络。

Conclusion: 学习算法是涌现计算的主要决定因素。基于奖励的优化能自主发现复杂动态机制，这些机制在直接基于梯度的优化中较难获得。这为理解神经计算和设计自适应AI系统提供了机制性见解和可操作原则。

Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that
emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine
intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role
of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains
largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward
fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical
decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal
that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining
stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic
attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,
which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We
further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a
powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that
enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous
solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex
dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and
correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity
increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary
determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization
autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less
accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both
mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for
designing adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in real-world and high-risk
applications has intensified the discussion about their trustworthiness and
ethical usage, from both a technical and a legislative perspective. The field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this challenge by
proposing explanations that bring to light the decision-making processes of
complex black-box models. Despite being an essential property, the robustness
of explanations is often an overlooked aspect during development: only robust
explanation methods can increase the trust in the system as a whole. This paper
investigates the role of robustness through the usage of a feature importance
aggregation derived from multiple models ($k$-nearest neighbours, random forest
and neural networks). Preliminary results showcase the potential in increasing
the trustworthiness of the application, while leveraging multiple model's
predictive power.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ELMO框架，使用BFloat16和Float8数据类型对极端多标签分类(XMC)模型进行纯低精度训练，通过Kahan求和与随机舍入实现Float8训练，结合梯度融合和分块优化，大幅降低GPU内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XMC方法主要依赖FP16-FP32混合精度训练，存在不稳定、内存使用和计算开销大的问题，而现有低精度方法通常对分类层保留更高精度。

Method: 使用BFloat16和Float8数据类型，结合Kahan求和与随机舍入技术，实现纯低精度训练，无需单精度主权重或张量缩放，并采用梯度融合和分块等内存优化。

Result: 成功训练300万标签的XMC模型，仅需6.6 GiB GPU内存，相比优化SOTA方法Renee所需的39.7 GiB大幅减少，且不损失精度。

Conclusion: ELMO框架证明了XMC模型可以完全在Float8精度下有效训练，显著降低了GPU内存需求，为大规模标签分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --
gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory
usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of
GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,
Renee without compromising accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAGer是一种训练自由的生成方法，通过基于token熵分布的不确定性来减少冗余计算并提高性能，只在存在高熵token时分支到多个推理路径，并将节省的计算预算重新分配给最需要探索替代路径的实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理语言模型和测试时扩展方法的兴起，通常需要大量计算从同一提示生成多个候选序列。不同提示具有不同的复杂性程度，因此需要不同的计算需求。

Method: 利用模型通过token-wise熵分布的不确定性，只在存在高熵token时分支到多个推理路径，然后将节省的计算预算重新分配给最需要探索替代路径的实例。

Result: 在AIME 2025等复杂推理基准测试中，EAGer可以在不访问目标标签的情况下重新分配预算，在推理长度和Pass@k方面实现最佳效率-性能权衡。当可访问目标标签时，EAGer生成的token减少65%（节省计算），Pass@k相比完全并行采样提高37%。

Conclusion: EAGer通过基于不确定性的计算重新分配，实现了更好的效率-性能平衡，在减少计算开销的同时提高了推理性能。

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental
challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on
task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the
"Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences
as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can
interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs
sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot
setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a
bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction,
descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method
delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving
up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned
protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs,
when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized
models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation
models.

Conclusion: 当前漏洞检测模型存在显著的偏差问题，检测对齐方法能够有效评估模型预测与真实漏洞位置的一致性，为改进漏洞定位能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system
security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their
now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to
flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than
precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection
granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development,
ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug,
evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent
work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus
narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more
fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the
presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often
predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we
investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an
explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection
Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines
that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the
vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and
adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze
multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we
show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by
non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and
spurious correlations. The code is available at

Abstract: Many machine learning applications require outputs that satisfy complex,

Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In
this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which
satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector
clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an
iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a
convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable
of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we
introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient
and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet
on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two
classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power
optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.

Conclusion: NWC为语言模型权重压缩提供了一种有效的学习型方法，解决了传统压缩方法在权重数据上的局限性。

Abstract: The efficient storage and transmission of language model weights is becoming
increasingly important, as their scale and adoption continue to grow. However,
as our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good
compression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual,
trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression
framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model
weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose
unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly,
and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions
rather than na\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight
Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model
weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of
autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1)
column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training
loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model
outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with
particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly
on par with FP16 models.

Abstract: Graph-based learning is a cornerstone for analyzing structured data, with
node classification as a central task. However, in many real-world graphs,
nodes lack informative feature vectors, leaving only neighborhood connectivity
and class labels as available signals. In such cases, effective classification
hinges on learning node embeddings that capture structural roles and
topological context. We introduce a fast semi-supervised embedding framework
that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) unsupervised
structure preservation via scalable modularity approximation, (ii) supervised
regularization to minimize intra-class variance among labeled nodes, and (iii)
semi-supervised propagation that refines unlabeled nodes through
random-walk-based label spreading with attention-weighted similarity. These
components are unified into a single iterative optimization scheme, yielding
high-quality node embeddings. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently
achieves classification accuracy at par with or superior to state-of-the-art
approaches, while requiring significantly less computational cost.

TL;DR: 使用自监督自动编码器处理临床数据中的标签稀缺和数据异质性问题，通过无标签数据构建潜在空间，提高心血管死亡预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床数据存在标签数据稀缺和数据异质性导致缺失值的问题，需要有效方法来提取知识并预测临床事件。

Method: 采用自监督自动编码器，利用无标签数据构建潜在空间，然后在该空间上训练神经网络分类器来预测心血管死亡。

Result: 与直接在原始数据上应用分类器相比，该方法提高了平衡准确率，特别是在无标签数据可用性增加的条件下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 自监督自动编码器是处理临床数据挑战的有效解决方案，尤其在无标签数据可用性增加的情况下具有前景。

Abstract: As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning
methods have been employed to extract knowledge from them and predict clinical
events. While promising, approaches suffer from at least two main issues: low
availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values.
This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently
address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from
patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent
space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural
network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved
balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data,
demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where
availability of unlabelled data could increase.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种细粒度联邦LoRA调优方法，通过分别调优A矩阵中的方向向量（编码共享知识）和B矩阵中的幅度向量（编码个性化知识），在异构数据场景下同时提升全局模型的泛化能力和本地模型的个性化适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦高效微调中存在的两个问题：1）异构数据场景下客户端漂移削弱全局模型泛化能力；2）现有联邦LoRA方法忽视了对调优矩阵的细粒度分析。

Method: 通过实验发现不同LoRA矩阵对向量方向和幅度变化的敏感性不同，提出分别调优A矩阵中的方向向量（共享知识）和B矩阵中的幅度向量（个性化知识），并使用全局和本地优化器的组合管道实现协同优化。

Result: 在Databricks-Dolly-15k和Natural Instructions数据集上使用LLaMA2-7B和Deepseek-7B模型进行实验，全局性能提升0.39%，本地性能提升0.59%。

Conclusion: 该方法在异构数据场景下有效提升了全局模型的泛化能力和本地模型的个性化适配，实现了全局与本地层面的协同优化。

Abstract: Federated efficient fine-tuning has emerged as an approach that leverages
distributed data and computational resources across nodes to address the
challenges of large-scale fine-tuning and privacy preservation. The Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained
models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,
in heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the
global model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of
individual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning
techniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address
this, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA
matrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and
magnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning
method. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,
which encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more
effectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,
by fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which
encode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized
knowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a
pipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further
improves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and
local levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model
and the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data
scenarios. Experiments on Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions with
LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B confirm that our method improves global performance
by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

<details>

Motivation: 解决LLM训练中推理、对齐和鲁棒性之间的权衡问题，提出这些特性是单一信息几何目标的不同投影。

Method: 使用单循环训练器，结合GRPO强化学习方法、SAMI风格的对称InfoNCE辅助损失和Sinkhorn最优传输正则化来约束几何漂移。

Result: 在1B参数LLM上的实验表明，高充分性指数原则预测更稳定的训练动态和更好的基准性能，信息几何分析验证了流形的理想结构变化。

Conclusion: ENIGMA方法无需奖励模型即可实现原则性推理，为可信能力提供了一条路径，支持推理、对齐和鲁棒性是单一信息几何目标投影的假设。

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model
Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training
that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an
organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's
information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information
(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn
optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry
drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower
bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes
these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the
selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior
to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles
predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO
ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates
desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our
hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a
single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA
demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a
path to trusted capability

TL;DR: ST-Vision-LLM是一个新颖的时空预测框架，将时空预测重新定义为视觉-语言融合问题，通过Vision-LLM视觉编码器处理历史全局交通矩阵作为图像序列，结合高效的数值编码方案和两阶段微调，在移动流量预测中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的时空流量预测对于密集城市移动网络中的主动资源管理至关重要。虽然大语言模型在时间序列分析中显示出潜力，但它们难以建模基于网格的流量数据的复杂空间依赖性，且处理密集地理网格信息效率低下。

Method: 提出ST-Vision-LLM框架，利用Vision-LLM视觉编码器处理历史全局交通矩阵作为图像序列；引入高效的编码方案将浮点值表示为单个token；采用两阶段微调：监督微调(SFT)和基于GRPO的强化学习优化。

Result: 在真实世界移动流量数据集上的评估显示，ST-Vision-LLM在长期预测准确性上比现有方法提高15.6%，在跨域少样本场景中超过次优基线30.04%以上，在各种数据稀缺环境中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ST-Vision-LLM通过将时空预测重新定义为视觉-语言融合问题，有效解决了LLM在建模空间依赖性和处理数值数据方面的挑战，为移动网络流量预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for
proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they
inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based
traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as
representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can
be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,
we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal
forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a
Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as
image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform
cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling
numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents
floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled
with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first
trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for
predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world
mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing
methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best
baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive
experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across
various data-scarce environments.

*Wenbo Wu,Qingyi Si,Xiurui Pan,Ye Wang,Jie Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LouisKV是一个高效的KV缓存检索框架，通过语义感知检索策略和细粒度管理方案，在长序列场景中显著减少计算和数据传输开销，同时保持接近无损的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存检索方法存在显著效率和准确性瓶颈，特别是在长输出推理场景中，由于每令牌检索和粗粒度页面级KV管理导致性能下降。随着大型推理模型的出现，高效处理长序列场景变得越来越重要。

Method: LouisKV引入语义感知检索策略，利用时间局部性仅在语义边界触发检索；设计解耦的细粒度管理方案，为输入和输出序列定制差异化策略；集成内核级优化，包括自定义Triton和CUDA内核来加速KV聚类和检索。

Result: 评估显示，LouisKV在多样化长序列任务中（包括长输入短输出、短输入长输出和长输入长输出场景）相比最先进的KV检索方法实现了高达4.7倍的加速，同时保持接近无损的准确性。

Conclusion: LouisKV通过利用关键KV的时间局部性和分布模式，提供了一个高效的KV缓存检索解决方案，能够有效应对各种长序列场景的挑战。

Abstract: While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in
auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its
practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods
mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.
However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due
to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially
in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning
models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.
To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs
exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit
distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.
Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache
retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,
LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal
locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing
computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,
fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input
and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's
attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.
Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level
optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV
clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to
4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while
maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,
including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input
long-output scenarios.

Motivation: 虽然风格迁移在视觉和语言领域发展成熟，但在时序数据方面的方法仍然有限。时序风格迁移可以支持数据增强和场景模拟，帮助机器学习模型在数据稀缺领域实现更好的泛化能力。

Method: 使用卷积编码器将时序数据解耦为内容和风格表示，通过自监督注意力扩散过程重新组合这些表示。在推理时，从两个不同的时序序列中提取内容和风格，实现条件生成以实现风格迁移。

Conclusion: DiffTSST为时序数据提供了一种有效的风格迁移方法，在数据增强和异常检测等实际应用中展现出实用价值。

Abstract: Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another.
It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation,
helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well
developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data
remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that
disentangles a time series into content and style representations via
convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised
attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and
style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel
samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and
quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further
validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST
improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.

Motivation: 现有动态图学习方法主要关注节点与时间的关系，但忽视了历史事件的影响。

Method: 首先为每个节点提取历史事件序列，通过事件适应机制将事件的细粒度特征与下游任务对齐；然后提出事件聚合机制，将历史知识有效整合到节点表示中。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上进行了广泛实验来评估和分析EVP。

Conclusion: EVP框架能够有效利用历史事件知识，提升动态图学习方法的性能。

Abstract: Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic
interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph
learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular
solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic
graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship
between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In
this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning
framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their
ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of
historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to
align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks.
Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate
historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.

Method: 基于细粒度并行化和rollout-train解耦原则，提供灵活编程接口，支持完全异步训练架构和高效的rollout机制（包括队列调度和环境级异步执行）。

Conclusion: ROLL Flash证明了异步RL后训练在保持性能的同时能够显著提升训练效率，为大规模语言模型的强化学习后训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a
crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse
capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training
still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present
ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL
post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles:
fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these
principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a
fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout
mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous
execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource
utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash
achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using
the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several
popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve
performance on par with synchronous training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图神经网络在节点特征稀疏或包含敏感信息时的性能下降和隐私泄露问题。

Method: 扩展传统特征传播，将可用特征划分为多个高斯噪声视图，每个视图通过图拓扑独立传播信息，然后聚合得到鲁棒的节点嵌入。

Result: 在多个图数据集上的实验表明，MFP在节点分类任务中优于现有基线方法，同时显著减少隐私泄露。

Conclusion: MFP为具有缺失或敏感特征的图学习领域提供了一个有效且隐私感知的框架。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node
classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often
depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world
scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive
information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.
Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data
leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework
that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting
privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by
dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each
propagating information independently through the graph topology. The
aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This
framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves
robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance
utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets
demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node
classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our
analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations
rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility
without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further
confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse
scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for
graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.

Method: 使用四种可解释性技术：UMAP投影中间激活、基于梯度的权重显著性、层切除/移除和激活修补，分析五个LLM模型。

Result: 发现医学知识主要在模型前半部分处理；年龄编码非线性且不连续；疾病进展表示非单调且循环；药物按医学专业而非作用机制聚类；某些模型中间层激活崩溃但最终恢复。

Conclusion: 这些结果可为医学任务的模型优化提供指导，建议在特定层应用微调、遗忘或去偏技术。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of medical-domain interpretability in Large
Language Models (LLMs). We study how the LLMs both represent and process
medical knowledge through four different interpretability techniques: (1) UMAP
projections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with
respect to the model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal and (4) activation
patching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a
coarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms,
diseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we
find that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's
layers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often
encoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate
layers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is
non-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in
Llama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism
of action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B
have activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final
layers. These results can guide future research on fine-tuning, un-learning or
de-biasing LLMs for medical tasks by suggesting at which layers in the model
these techniques should be applied.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data
privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the
deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper
proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the
memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model
accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid}
first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly
evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After
that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an
execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding
memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of
recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of
each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out
the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to
effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and
off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a
15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared
with the baselines.

Abstract: The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing
the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions.
However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly
time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches
in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this
work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs),
classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a
consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively
controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which
enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our
approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000
candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs
from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline
significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than
single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove
sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective.
Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can
accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上的实验表明，该方法能生成生理上真实且具有诊断价值的信号，在下游任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了生成模型在ECG重建中的潜力，对可扩展、低成本的心脏筛查具有重要意义。

Abstract: Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the clinical gold standard for
cardiac diagnosis, providing comprehensive spatial coverage of the heart
necessary to detect conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). However,
their lack of portability limits continuous and large-scale use. Three-lead ECG
systems are widely used in wearable devices due to their simplicity and
mobility, but they often fail to capture pathologies in unmeasured regions. To
address this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that
reconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model
includes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial
dependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and
Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing
test with expert cardiologists. To further validate diagnostic utility, we
fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label
classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions, including six
different myocardial infarction locations, using both real and generated
signals. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that our method produces
physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust
performance in downstream tasks. This work demonstrates the potential of
generative modeling for ECG reconstruction and its implications for scalable,
low-cost cardiac screening.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架来描述摊销学习方法，将现有方法分为参数化、隐式和显式三种机制，并针对大规模数据集扩展性问题提出了迭代摊销推理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代学习系统越来越依赖摊销学习，但现有方法在如何编码和利用任务特定信息方面存在差异，且难以扩展到大型数据集。

Method: 提出了一个分类框架，将摊销模型分为参数化、隐式和显式机制，并引入迭代摊销推理方法，通过小批量逐步优化解决方案。

Result: 该框架统一了优化基础的元学习和前向传递摊销方法，为通用任务适应提供了可扩展的基础。

Conclusion: 迭代摊销推理方法能够有效解决当前方法在大规模数据集上的扩展性问题，为摊销学习提供了更强大的理论基础和实践框架。

Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of
reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid
generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches,
including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers
and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they
encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context
examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such
methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as
initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they
incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes
amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on
whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.
Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most
methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process
task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address
this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine
solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic
optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with
forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and
extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了DFTopK，一种新颖的可微分Top-K算子，实现了最优的O(n)时间复杂度，避免了现有方法中的梯度冲突和排序依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 级联排名在大规模信息检索系统中广泛使用，但Top-K算子不可微分，阻碍端到端训练。现有方法存在目标不对齐或梯度冲突问题，且复杂度较高。

Method: 通过放松归一化约束，DFTopK获得闭式解并避免排序，直接构建Top-K选择算子的可微分近似，实现线性时间复杂度。

Result: 在RecFLow基准和工业系统中，DFTopK显著提高训练效率并实现更优性能，在线A/B测试中在相同计算预算下带来+1.77%的收入提升。

Conclusion: 这是首个将可微分Top-K算子引入推荐系统的工作，也是首个实现理论上最优线性时间复杂度的Top-K选择方法。

Abstract: Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information
retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is
non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include
Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics
like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable
sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for
direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix
aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable
approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft
permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K
operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their
dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a
novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity.
By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and
avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in
differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public
benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that
DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior
performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In
the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same
computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into
recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal
linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our
implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种减少整数AI推理中重新缩放操作成本的方法，通过应用更强的量化到重新缩放乘数，并引入了重新缩放感知训练方法，在保持模型精度的同时显著降低硬件成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整数AI推理在嵌入式系统中显著降低了计算复杂度，但量化感知训练仍忽略了推理过程中整数重新缩放的影响，这是一个在整数AI推理中硬件成本较高的操作。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）在训练后应用更强的量化到重新缩放乘数以降低重新缩放成本；2）引入重新缩放感知训练，一种用于超低比特宽度重新缩放乘数的微调方法。

Result: 实验表明，即使将重新缩放器宽度减少8倍，通过最小的增量重新训练也能保持完整的精度。

Conclusion: 这使得资源受限的嵌入式系统能够实现更节能和成本效益更高的AI推理。

Abstract: Integer AI inference significantly reduces computational complexity in
embedded systems. Quantization-aware training (QAT) helps mitigate accuracy
degradation associated with post-training quantization but still overlooks the
impact of integer rescaling during inference, which is a hardware costly
operation in integer-only AI inference. This work shows that rescaling cost can
be dramatically reduced post-training, by applying a stronger quantization to
the rescale multiplicands at no model-quality loss. Furthermore, we introduce
Rescale-Aware Training, a fine tuning method for ultra-low bit-width rescaling
multiplicands. Experiments show that even with 8x reduced rescaler widths, the
full accuracy is preserved through minimal incremental retraining. This enables
more energy-efficient and cost-efficient AI inference for resource-constrained
embedded systems.

TL;DR: ReLook是一个基于视觉的强化学习框架，通过多模态大语言模型作为工具，实现前端代码的生成-诊断-优化循环，显著提升视觉化前端代码生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在算法代码生成方面表现出色，但在前端开发中表现不佳，因为前端代码的正确性需要基于渲染像素和交互来判断。

Method: 采用代理式、视觉基础的强化学习框架，使用多模态LLM作为视觉批评家和反馈源，引入强制优化规则确保单调改进，并在推理时解耦批评家以降低延迟。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试中，ReLook始终优于强基线方法，在视觉基础的前端代码生成方面表现突出。

Conclusion: ReLook证明了代理感知、视觉奖励以及训练-推理解耦在前端代码生成中的有效性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they
struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered
pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded
reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust
generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.
During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual
critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,
vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors
renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we
introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only
improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,
we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,
keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.
Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong
baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the
benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference
decoupling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在离线RL中存在性能与效率的权衡：扩散策略计算昂贵，一致性策略性能较差，需要一种统一方法来超越单个方法的局限性。

Method: 将现代生成模型统一视为学习ODE控制的连续时间生成轨迹，提出GTP学习整个ODE解映射，并引入两个理论原则的适配方法。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著优于先前生成策略，在多个困难的AntMaze任务上获得完美分数。

Conclusion: GTP通过统一的ODE视角成功弥合了生成模型在离线RL中的性能与效率差距，为生成策略提供了更清晰的设计空间。

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline
reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,
multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,
iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while
fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded
performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this
gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,
lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including
diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of
learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer
design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative
Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns
the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical
for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled
adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative
policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.

Conclusion: 上下文感知的MBRL方法在自动驾驶赛车任务中具有更好的泛化能力，cMask方法在应对不同对手行为时表现优异。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking
technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well
as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in
real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to
unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a
diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown
susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of
MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated
autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the
head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision
processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the
context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward
dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and
propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We
demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to
out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We
also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as
well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL
approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型中的错误推理模式，因为某些重要应用需要建模错误的推理模式，例如用于课堂实时反馈或教师培训的自动化系统。

Method: MISTAKE方法：(1) 通过错误答案与潜在误解之间的循环一致性构建高质量的错误推理合成示例；(2) 使用生成的数据学习学生模拟、误解分类和答案生成模型。

Result: 在三个教育任务上的评估显示：(1) 基于特定误解模拟错误学生答案的准确率更高；(2) 从观察到的错误答案推断潜在误解的性能提升；(3) 生成错误答案时与专家编写的干扰项答案对齐度更高。

Conclusion: MISTAKE方法能够有效建模错误推理模式，在教育应用中显示出良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Research on reasoning in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
improving the correctness of their outputs. But some important applications
require modeling reasoning patterns that are incorrect. For example, automated
systems that can reason about and simulate student errors are useful for
providing real-time feedback in the classroom or offline practice for
educators-in-training. This paper presents a new method, MISTAKE, that (1)
constructs high-quality synthetic examples of reasoning errors by leveraging
cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; and (2)
uses the generated data to learn models for student simulation, misconception
classification, and answer generation. We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational
tasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect
student answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance
inferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher
alignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect
answers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).

Result: LightGBM结合知识引导特征表现最佳，R²=0.86，MSE=14.99 W m⁻²，MAE=8.82 W m⁻²。特征重要性分析显示知识引导特征对预测蒸散发最为重要。

Conclusion: 成功开发了2019-2024年期间500米空间分辨率的日尺度蒸散发数据产品，与州级气象站估算结果相比表现出最佳一致性。

Abstract: Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the land-atmosphere
interactions, yet its accurate quantification across various spatiotemporal
scales remains a challenge. In situ measurement approaches, like eddy
covariance (EC) or weather station-based ET estimation, allow for measuring ET
at a single location. Agricultural uses of ET require estimates for each field
over broad areas, making it infeasible to deploy sensing systems at each
location. This study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine
learning (ML) techniques with multispectral remote sensing data, griddled
meteorology and EC data to upscale ET across the Midwest United States. We
compare four tree-based models - Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM -
and a simple feed-forward artificial neural network in combination with
features engineered using knowledge-guided ML principles. Models were trained
and tested on EC towers located in the Midwest of the United States using
k-fold cross validation with k=5 and site-year, biome stratified train-test
split to avoid data leakage. Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided
features outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE =
8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5). Feature importance
analysis shows that knowledge-guided features were most important for
predicting evapotranspiration. Using the best performing model, we provide a
data product at 500 m spatial and one-day temporal resolution for gridded ET
for the period of 2019-2024. Intercomparison between the new gridded product
and state-level weather station-based ET estimates show best-in-class
correspondence.

Motivation: 多跳问题需要识别多个知识目标来合成答案，现有RAG方法难以理解复杂语义结构，且在检索多个信息目标时容易受到无关噪声的影响。

Method: 构建多信息级别知识图谱(Multi-L KG)来建模不同信息层次，设计查询特定图神经网络(QSGNN)进行表示学习，采用查询引导的层内/层间消息传递机制，并提出两种合成数据生成策略进行预训练。

Conclusion: 所提出的图表示学习框架能有效提升多跳问题检索性能，显著减少噪声影响，在复杂多跳场景中具有明显优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance
Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources.
However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple
knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG
systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully
understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible
to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning
framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a
Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various
information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop
questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network
(QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs
intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the
information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates
multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the
impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we
further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the
QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the
improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计套利方法通常分步进行因子识别和交易策略制定，无法在考虑交易成本的情况下最大化风险调整收益。需要一种端到端的框架来联合优化因子学习和交易策略。

Method: 开发注意力因子作为条件潜在因子，从公司特征嵌入中学习复杂交互关系。使用通用序列模型从因子残差组合中识别时间序列信号，并联合估计因子和套利交易策略。

Result: 在24年美国最大股票数据集上，注意力因子模型实现了超过4的样本外夏普比率。考虑交易成本后的一步解决方案获得了前所未有的2.3夏普比率。

Conclusion: 联合学习因子和交易策略对于在交易成本后最大化盈利能力至关重要，弱因子在套利交易中具有重要作用。

Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar
assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through
factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes
risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are
conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They
are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex
interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of
our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage
trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading
costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor
model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S.
equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented
Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are
important for arbitrage trading.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文指出当前强化学习方法在数学推理上只是强化现有能力而非发现新能力，为此提出了MATH-B基准测试来挑战现有模型，推动探索驱动的强化学习方法发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法在数学推理任务上主要是在强化模型已有的解题模式，而不是真正探索和获得新的推理能力，这与强化学习的核心承诺相悖。

Method: 构建了MATH-B基准测试，该基准专门设计来击败常见开源模型，即使在大规模采样预算下也难以解决。问题来源于DAPO-Math-17K和DeepScaleR数据集的高中数学题目子集。

Result: 验证了现有RL微调模型（如Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B和DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview）在MATH-B基准上表现很差，即使在pass@1024的大规模采样下也难以解决这些问题。

Conclusion: MATH-B基准将推动探索驱动的强化学习方法发展，激发更深层次的推理能力，超越当前仅强化现有能力的局限。

Abstract: With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)
methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.
However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical
limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many
existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math
benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL
fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen
existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such
sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster
exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we
introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat
common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling
budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that
learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated
sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and
DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school
math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as
Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform
poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall
short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze
exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We
release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.

offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed
model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower
bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives
once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers
with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction
tasks that is free of lookahead bias.

*Nianyi Lin,Jiajie Zhang,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出BGPO算法解决扩散大语言模型强化学习中内存效率问题，通过构建特殊下界实现线性梯度计算，显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在近似扩散大语言模型的似然函数时，由于需要保留所有蒙特卡洛样本的前向计算图，导致内存开销巨大，限制了样本大小和近似精度

Method: 提出边界引导策略优化(BGPO)，构建满足线性和等价性两个关键特性的ELBO目标下界，实现跨样本梯度累积和恒定内存使用

Result: 实验表明BGPO在数学问题求解、代码生成和规划任务中显著优于之前的RL算法

Conclusion: BGPO通过内存高效的RL算法设计，解决了扩散大语言模型强化学习中的关键瓶颈，实现了更准确的似然近似和更好的性能

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在语言模型的强化学习中，通过基于预训练模型隐藏状态的表示多样性奖励进行有意识的探索，能显著提升推理任务的多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前强化学习技术是否真正促进语言模型发现新行为，还是仅仅优化已有行为，探索预训练模型知识如何指导搜索过程。

Method: 使用基于预训练语言模型隐藏状态的表示多样性奖励来激励模型发现新颖多样的行为，应用于后训练和推理时扩展设置。

Result: 表示多样性探索显著提高了多样性和pass@k率，在推理时提升效率（如Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct在多数任务上验证器效率提升超50%），在后训练中超越标准RL方法（如Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct在AIME 2024上实现3倍测试时样本效率提升）。

Conclusion: 有意识的探索配合正确的多样性概念是超越单纯行为优化的实用路径，能促进新行为的发现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to expand the capabilities of language
models, but it is unclear if current RL techniques promote the discovery of
novel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In
this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly
incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to
understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our
main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,
representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden
states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for
post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For
inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves
efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and
reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%
improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we
show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves
reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL
post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained
Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model,
demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our
findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of
diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond
sharpening.

TL;DR: QeRL是一个量化增强的强化学习框架，通过结合NVFP4量化和LoRA技术，加速LLM的RL训练过程，减少内存开销，并通过量化噪声增强探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL训练LLM需要大量GPU内存和长时间rollout，资源消耗大，限制了大规模模型的应用。

Method: 结合NVFP4量化和LoRA技术，引入自适应量化噪声机制动态调整训练过程中的噪声水平。

Result: 在rollout阶段实现1.5倍加速，首次在单张H100 80GB GPU上训练32B LLM，在数学基准测试中达到90.8%(GSM8K)和77.4%(MATH 500)的准确率。

Conclusion: QeRL是一个高效且有效的LLM强化学习训练框架，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

*Edward Stevinson,Lucas Prieto,Melih Barsbey,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出对抗性漏洞源于神经网络中的高效信息编码机制，特别是叠加现象（网络表示的特征多于维度数），攻击者利用叠加特征间的干扰来生成可预测的攻击模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对对抗性样本产生原因存在分歧，要么认为是决策边界不规则导致的伪影，要么认为是网络对非鲁棒特征的敏感性。本文旨在从信息编码角度提供新的解释。

Method: 通过精确控制叠加现象的合成实验，验证叠加足以产生对抗性漏洞；在CIFAR-10上训练的ViT模型中进一步验证这一发现。

Result: 证明对抗性扰动利用了叠加特征间的干扰，攻击模式可从特征排列中预测；解释了模型间攻击可迁移性和类别特定漏洞模式两种现象。

Conclusion: 对抗性漏洞可能是网络表示压缩的副产品，而非学习过程缺陷或非鲁棒输入的问题。

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning
process or non-robust inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模预训练模型能够低成本生成预测特征，但如何将这些预测特征整合到下游决策中仍是一个问题。特别是在上下文复杂、非平稳且部分可观测的在线决策场景中。

Method: PULSE-UCB算法：利用在辅助数据集上训练的预训练模型，在在线决策过程中填补缺失的上下文特征。辅助数据集包含完全观测的上下文，这些数据在无自适应干预的情况下收集。

Result: 在i.i.d.上下文情况下，对于Hölder光滑的缺失特征，PULSE-UCB实现了接近最优的性能，并提供了匹配的下界。结果量化了预测上下文的不确定性对决策质量的影响，以及需要多少历史数据来改进下游学习。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将预训练模型整合到在线决策中，遗憾保证明确反映了预训练模型的质量，为利用预测特征进行决策提供了理论框架。

Abstract: The rise of large-scale pretrained models has made it feasible to generate
predictive or synthetic features at low cost, raising the question of how to
incorporate such surrogate predictions into downstream decision-making. We
study this problem in the setting of online linear contextual bandits, where
contexts may be complex, nonstationary, and only partially observed. In
addition to bandit data, we assume access to an auxiliary dataset containing
fully observed contexts--common in practice since such data are collected
without adaptive interventions. We propose PULSE-UCB, an algorithm that
leverages pretrained models trained on the auxiliary data to impute missing
features during online decision-making. We establish regret guarantees that
decompose into a standard bandit term plus an additional component reflecting
pretrained model quality. In the i.i.d. context case with H\"older-smooth
missing features, PULSE-UCB achieves near-optimal performance, supported by
matching lower bounds. Our results quantify how uncertainty in predicted
contexts affects decision quality and how much historical data is needed to
improve downstream learning.

Motivation: 生成模型经常存在校准不足的问题，即采样分布的类别概率和其他统计量与期望值存在偏差，这影响了模型的实际应用效果。

Method: 将校准问题构建为约束优化问题，寻找满足校准约束的KL散度最近模型。提出了两种替代目标：relax损失（用校准不足惩罚替代约束）和reward损失（将校准转化为奖励微调问题）。

Result: 这些方法在蛋白质设计、图像生成和语言建模等应用中，显著降低了数百个同时约束和亿级参数模型的校准误差。

Conclusion: 提出的两种微调方法能够有效解决生成模型的校准问题，在多个领域和模型规模下都取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Generative models frequently suffer miscalibration, wherein class
probabilities and other statistics of the sampling distribution deviate from
desired values. We frame calibration as a constrained optimization problem and
seek the closest model in Kullback-Leibler divergence satisfying calibration
constraints. To address the intractability of imposing these constraints
exactly, we introduce two surrogate objectives for fine-tuning: (1) the relax
loss, which replaces the constraint with a miscalibration penalty, and (2) the
reward loss, which converts calibration into a reward fine-tuning problem. We
demonstrate that these approaches substantially reduce calibration error across
hundreds of simultaneous constraints and models with up to one billion
parameters, spanning applications in protein design, image generation, and
language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自适应实验通过基于过去结果调整治疗分配来提高效率，但这种自适应性打破了支撑经典渐近理论的独立同分布假设。同时，许多感兴趣的问题涉及分布层面，超出了平均效应的范畴。

Method: 结合双重稳健得分与方差稳定化，通过希尔伯特空间鞅中心极限定理确保渐近正态性，并引入样本拟合的稳定化检验以控制第一类错误。

Result: 实验表明该方法校准良好，对均值漂移和高阶矩差异都有效，优于仅限于标量效应的自适应基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为自适应数据收集下的分布推断提供了有效的核方法，能够处理超出平均效应的分布差异问题。

Abstract: Adaptive experiments improve efficiency by adjusting treatment assignments
based on past outcomes, but this adaptivity breaks the i.i.d. assumptions that
underpins classical asymptotics. At the same time, many questions of interest
are distributional, extending beyond average effects. Kernel treatment effects
(KTE) provide a flexible framework by representing counterfactual outcome
distributions in an RKHS and comparing them via kernel distances. We present
the first kernel-based framework for distributional inference under adaptive
data collection. Our method combines doubly robust scores with variance
stabilization to ensure asymptotic normality via a Hilbert-space martingale
CLT, and introduces a sample-fitted stabilized test with valid type-I error.
Experiments show it is well calibrated and effective for both mean shifts and
higher-moment differences, outperforming adaptive baselines limited to scalar
effects.

Conclusion: NeVI-Cut是一种准确、模块化的神经网络变分推理方法，能够有效处理反馈切断问题，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: In many scientific applications, uncertainty of estimates from an earlier
(upstream) analysis needs to be propagated in subsequent (downstream) Bayesian
analysis, without feedback. Cutting feedback methods, also termed cut-Bayes,
achieve this by constructing a cut-posterior distribution that prevents
backward information flow. Cutting feedback like nested MCMC is computationally
challenging while variational inference (VI) cut-Bayes methods need two
variational approximations and require access to the upstream data and model.
In this manuscript we propose, NeVI-Cut, a provably accurate and modular neural
network-based variational inference method for cutting feedback. We directly
utilize samples from the upstream analysis without requiring access to the
upstream data or model. This simultaneously preserves modularity of analysis
and reduces approximation errors by avoiding a variational approximation for
the upstream model. We then use normalizing flows to specify the conditional
variational family for the downstream parameters and estimate the conditional
cut-posterior as a variational solution of Monte Carlo average loss over all
the upstream samples. We provide theoretical guarantees on the NeVI-Cut
estimate to approximate any cut-posterior. Our results are in a fixed-data
regime and provide convergence rates of the actual variational solution,
quantifying how richness of the neural architecture and the complexity of the
target cut-posterior dictate the approximation quality. In the process, we
establish new results on uniform Kullback-Leibler approximation rates of
conditional normalizing flows. Simulation studies and two real-world analyses
illustrate how NeVI-Cut achieves significant computational gains over
traditional cutting feedback methods and is considerably more accurate than
parametric variational cut approaches.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-free machine learning method for creating
prediction regions with a guaranteed coverage probability level. However, a
data scientist often faces three challenges in practice: (i) the determination
of a conformal prediction region is only approximate, jeopardizing the
finite-sample validity of prediction, (ii) the computation required could be
prohibitively expensive, and (iii) the shape of a conformal prediction region
is hard to control. This article offers new insights into the relationship
among the monotonicity of the non-conformity measure, the monotonicity of the
plausibility function, and the exact determination of a conformal prediction
region. Based on these new insights, we propose a simple strategy to alleviate
the three challenges simultaneously.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了量化神经网络训练中的学习动态，特别是量化超参数（如位宽和量化范围）对训练过程的影响。通过理论分析表明，在高维极限下，STE训练动态收敛到确定性常微分方程，揭示了泛化误差先出现平台期然后急剧下降的现象。


<details>

Motivation: 量化神经网络训练优化的是离散、不可微的目标函数，虽然STE方法被广泛使用，但量化超参数对学习动态的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 通过理论分析，在高维极限下证明STE动态收敛到确定性常微分方程，进行定点分析量化与未量化线性模型的渐近偏差，并将SGD分析技术扩展到权重和输入的非线性变换。

Result: 发现STE训练呈现平台期后泛化误差急剧下降的模式，平台期长度取决于量化范围。定点分析量化了与未量化模型的渐近偏差。

Conclusion: 量化超参数显著影响神经网络训练动态，特别是量化范围决定了训练平台期的长度，这为优化量化训练提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Quantized neural network training optimizes a discrete, non-differentiable
objective. The straight-through estimator (STE) enables backpropagation through
surrogate gradients and is widely used. While previous studies have primarily
focused on the properties of surrogate gradients and their convergence, the
influence of quantization hyperparameters, such as bit width and quantization
range, on learning dynamics remains largely unexplored. We theoretically show
that in the high-dimensional limit, STE dynamics converge to a deterministic
ordinary differential equation. This reveals that STE training exhibits a
plateau followed by a sharp drop in generalization error, with plateau length
depending on the quantization range. A fixed-point analysis quantifies the
asymptotic deviation from the unquantized linear model. We also extend
analytical techniques for stochastic gradient descent to nonlinear
transformations of weights and inputs.

Abstract: Missing data in online reinforcement learning (RL) poses challenges compared
to missing data in standard tabular data or in offline policy learning. The
need to impute and act at each time step means that imputation cannot be put
off until enough data exist to produce stable imputation models. It also means
future data collection and learning depend on previous imputations. This paper
proposes fully online imputation ensembles. We find that maintaining multiple
imputation pathways may help balance the need to capture uncertainty under
missingness and the need for efficiency in online settings. We consider
multiple approaches for incorporating these pathways into learning and action
selection. Using a Grid World experiment with various types of missingness, we
provide preliminary evidence that multiple imputation pathways may be a useful
framework for constructing simple and efficient online missing data RL methods.

Conclusion: 时间模式的存在与否从根本上约束序列模型的可学习性，提出的预测信息框架为模型选择和复杂度评估提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Sequential data - ranging from financial time series to natural language -
has driven the growing adoption of autoregressive models. However, these
algorithms rely on the presence of underlying patterns in the data, and their
identification often depends heavily on human expertise. Misinterpreting these
patterns can lead to model misspecification, resulting in increased
generalization error and degraded performance. The recently proposed evolving
pattern (EvoRate) metric addresses this by using the mutual information between
the next data point and its past to guide regression order estimation and
feature selection. Building on this idea, we introduce a general framework
based on predictive information, defined as the mutual information between the
past and the future, $I(X_{past}; X_{future})$. This quantity naturally defines
an information-theoretic learning curve, which quantifies the amount of
predictive information available as the observation window grows. Using this
formalism, we show that the presence or absence of temporal patterns
fundamentally constrains the learnability of sequential models: even an optimal
predictor cannot outperform the intrinsic information limit imposed by the
data. We validate our framework through experiments on synthetic data,
demonstrating its ability to assess model adequacy, quantify the inherent
complexity of a dataset, and reveal interpretable structure in sequential data.

Conclusion: CLS提供了一个原则性的工具来指导迁移学习中的数据选择，能够可靠地区分正向、模糊和负向迁移。

Abstract: Transfer learning has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, as it
can empower models by leveraging knowledge from related domains to improve
learning effectiveness. However, transferring from poorly aligned data can harm
rather than help performance, making it crucial to determine whether the
transfer will be beneficial before implementation. This work aims to address
this challenge by proposing an innovative metric to measure dataset similarity
and provide quantitative guidance on transferability. In the literature,
existing methods largely focus on feature distributions while overlooking label
information and predictive relationships, potentially missing critical
transferability insights. In contrast, our proposed metric, the Cross-Learning
Score (CLS), measures dataset similarity through bidirectional generalization
performance between domains. We provide a theoretical justification for CLS by
establishing its connection to the cosine similarity between the decision
boundaries for the target and source datasets. Computationally, CLS is
efficient and fast to compute as it bypasses the problem of expensive
distribution estimation for high-dimensional problems. We further introduce a
general framework that categorizes source datasets into positive, ambiguous, or
negative transfer zones based on their CLS relative to the baseline error,
enabling informed decisions. Additionally, we extend this approach to
encoder-head architectures in deep learning to better reflect modern transfer
pipelines. Extensive experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world tasks
demonstrate that CLS can reliably predict whether transfer will improve or
degrade performance, offering a principled tool for guiding data selection in
transfer learning.

Abstract: Random forest is an important method for ML applications due to its broad
outperformance over competing methods for structured tabular data. We propose a
method for transfer learning in nonparametric regression using a centered
random forest (CRF) with distance covariance-based feature weights, assuming
the unknown source and target regression functions are different for a few
features (sparsely different). Our method first obtains residuals from
predicting the response in the target domain using a source domain-trained CRF.
Then, we fit another CRF to the residuals, but with feature splitting
probabilities proportional to the sample distance covariance between the
features and the residuals in an independent sample. We derive an upper bound
on the mean square error rate of the procedure as a function of sample sizes
and difference dimension, theoretically demonstrating transfer learning
benefits in random forests. In simulations, we show that the results obtained
for the CRFs also hold numerically for the standard random forest (SRF) method
with data-driven feature split selection. Beyond transfer learning, our results
also show the benefit of distance-covariance-based weights on the performance
of RF in some situations. Our method shows significant gains in predicting the
mortality of ICU patients in smaller-bed target hospitals using a large

*Tomoya Wakayama,Taiji Suzuki*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文为上下文学习(ICL)建立了有限样本统计理论，提出了风险分解为贝叶斯间隙和后验方差两个正交分量，揭示了Transformer在预训练中选择最优元算法并在测试时快速收敛到真实任务的最优算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文学习理论缺乏对任务混合和有限样本情况下的系统分析，需要建立统一的理论框架来理解ICL的统计特性。

Method: 采用元学习框架分析任务混合的ICL，提出风险分解方法，对均匀注意力Transformer推导非渐近上界，分析预训练提示数量和上下文长度的影响。

Result: 发现后验方差仅由真实任务难度决定，任务混合带来的不确定性随少量上下文示例呈指数级快速消失。Transformer在预训练中选择最优元算法并在测试时快速收敛。

Conclusion: 提供了ICL的统一视角：Transformer在预训练中选择最优元算法，并在测试时仅需少量上下文示例就能快速收敛到真实任务的最优算法。

Abstract: This paper develops a finite-sample statistical theory for in-context
learning (ICL), analyzed within a meta-learning framework that accommodates
mixtures of diverse task types. We introduce a principled risk decomposition
that separates the total ICL risk into two orthogonal components: Bayes Gap and
Posterior Variance. The Bayes Gap quantifies how well the trained model
approximates the Bayes-optimal in-context predictor. For a uniform-attention
Transformer, we derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on this gap, which
explicitly clarifies the dependence on the number of pretraining prompts and
their context length. The Posterior Variance is a model-independent risk
representing the intrinsic task uncertainty. Our key finding is that this term
is determined solely by the difficulty of the true underlying task, while the
uncertainty arising from the task mixture vanishes exponentially fast with only
a few in-context examples. Together, these results provide a unified view of
ICL: the Transformer selects the optimal meta-algorithm during pretraining and
rapidly converges to the optimal algorithm for the true task at test time.

*Yannis Montreuil,Letian Yu,Axel Carlier,Lai Xing Ng,Wei Tsang Ooi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个端到端学习延迟（L2D）的对抗鲁棒性框架，涵盖分类和回归任务，通过形式化攻击、提出成本敏感对抗损失函数，并建立理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习延迟（L2D）虽然能实现混合决策，但极易受到对抗性扰动的影响，现有鲁棒性分析仅关注两阶段设置，忽略了端到端（单阶段）情况。

Method: 开发了形式化攻击框架，提出成本敏感的对抗替代损失函数，建立了包括H、(R,F)和贝叶斯一致性的理论保证。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验证实，该方法在保持清洁性能的同时，提高了对无目标和有目标攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为端到端学习延迟系统提供了首个全面的对抗鲁棒性框架，具有重要的理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables hybrid decision-making by routing inputs
either to a predictor or to external experts. While promising, L2D is highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which can not only flip predictions
but also manipulate deferral decisions. Prior robustness analyses focus solely
on two-stage settings, leaving open the end-to-end (one-stage) case where
predictor and allocation are trained jointly. We introduce the first framework
for adversarial robustness in one-stage L2D, covering both classification and
regression. Our approach formalizes attacks, proposes cost-sensitive
adversarial surrogate losses, and establishes theoretical guarantees including
$\mathcal{H}$, $(\mathcal{R }, \mathcal{F})$, and Bayes consistency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that our methods improve robustness
against untargeted and targeted attacks while preserving clean performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准PAC泛化界在期望损失方面往往不足以捕捉数据中子组间的不平衡，需要新的风险度量来更好地控制分布偏移和子组不平衡。

Method: 引入约束f-熵风险度量家族，利用f-散度进行精细控制；推导经典和分解PAC-Bayesian泛化界；设计自约束算法直接最小化这些界。

Result: 获得了超越标准风险的首个分解PAC-Bayesian保证，并在子组级别提供了保证。

Conclusion: 该方法在实证中显示了实用性，为处理子组不平衡问题提供了新的理论框架和算法工具。

Abstract: PAC generalization bounds on the risk, when expressed in terms of the
expected loss, are often insufficient to capture imbalances between subgroups
in the data. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new family of risk
measures, called constrained f-entropic risk measures, which enable finer
control over distributional shifts and subgroup imbalances via f-divergences,
and include the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), a well-known risk measure. We
derive both classical and disintegrated PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for
this family of risks, providing the first disintegratedPAC-Bayesian guarantees
beyond standard risks. Building on this theory, we design a self-bounding
algorithm that minimizes our bounds directly, yielding models with guarantees
at the subgroup level. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the usefulness of
our approach.

Abstract: High-dimensional regression often suffers from heavy-tailed noise and
outliers, which can severely undermine the reliability of least-squares based
methods. To improve robustness, we adopt a non-smooth Wilcoxon score based rank
objective and incorporate structured group sparsity regularization, a natural
generalization of the lasso, yielding a group lasso regularized rank regression
method. By extending the tuning-free parameter selection scheme originally
developed for the lasso, we introduce a data-driven, simulation-based tuning
rule and further establish a finite-sample error bound for the resulting
estimator. On the computational side, we develop a proximal augmented
Lagrangian method for solving the associated optimization problem, which
eliminates the singularity issues encountered in existing methods, thereby
enabling efficient semismooth Newton updates for the subproblems. Extensive
numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our
proposed estimator against alternatives, and showcase the scalability of the
algorithm across both simulated and real-data settings.
