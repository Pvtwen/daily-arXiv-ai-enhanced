### [1] [A Masked Representation Learning to Model Cardiac Functions Using Multiple Physiological Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08830)
*Seong-A Park,Jong-Eui Chae,Sungdong Kim,Hyung-Chul Lee,Hyun-Lim Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: SNUPHY-M模型通过自监督学习同时分析ECG、PPG和ABP三种生理信号，提取心脏周期的电学、压力和流体特征，在血流动力学监测任务中显著优于监督学习和单信号SSL模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床环境中需要综合分析多种生理信号来监测血流动力学，但现有研究多集中于单一信号分析，缺乏适用于真实临床场景的复杂信号分析方法。

Method: 基于自监督学习的掩码表示学习方法，通过恢复三种被掩码的生理信号（ECG、PPG、ABP）来提取反映心脏周期多种物理特征的生理特征。

Result: 在低血压、心搏量、收缩压、舒张压和年龄预测等临床下游任务中，SNUPHY-M显著优于监督学习或单信号SSL模型，特别是在使用无创信号的预测任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: SNUPHY-M是首个将多模态自监督学习应用于心血管分析（涉及ECG、PPG和ABP信号）的模型，能有效支持临床决策，实现精确诊断，为无创早期诊断和血流动力学管理做出重要贡献。

Abstract: In clinical settings, monitoring hemodynamics is crucial for managing patient
prognosis, necessitating the integrated analysis of multiple physiological
signals. While recent research has analyzed single signals such as
electrocardiography (ECG) or photoplethysmography (PPG), there has yet to be a
proposal for an approach that encompasses the complex signal analysis required
in actual clinical scenarios. In this study, we introduce the SNUPHY-M (Seoul
National University hospital PHYsiological signal Masked representation
learning) model extracts physiological features reflecting the electrical,
pressure, and fluid characteristics of the cardiac cycle in the process of
restoring three masked physiological signals based on self-supervised learning
(SSL): ECG, PPG, and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. By employing
multiple physical characteristics, the model can extract more enriched features
only using non-invasive signals. We evaluated the model's performance in
clinical downstream tasks such as hypotension, stroke volume, systolic blood
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and age prediction. Our results showed that
the SNUPHY-M significantly outperformed supervised or SSL models, especially in
prediction tasks using non-invasive signals. To the best of our knowledge,
SNUPHY-M is the first model to apply multi-modal SSL to cardiovascular analysis
involving ECG, PPG, and ABP signals. This approach effectively supports
clinical decision-making and enables precise diagnostics, contributing
significantly to the early diagnosis and management of hemodynamics without
invasiveness.

TL;DR: 本文探讨AI在教育领域的应用，特别是信号处理教育，重点关注技术限制和实际应用，旨在通过开发智能教科书来提升教育体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI技术取得了重大突破，但真正的挑战在于如何公平、负责任地使用AI来改善全球人类状况，特别是在教育领域。

Method: 提供关于AI在教育环境中使用的核心技术问题的入门知识，包括确保公平性、包容性、处理幻觉输出和资源高效使用，并通过开发沉浸式、结构化、可靠的智能教科书来说明这些考虑。

Result: 文章为寻求推进AI在工程教育中作用的研究人员和教育工作者提供了资源。

Conclusion: AI在教育领域的应用具有巨大潜力，特别是在信号处理教育中，但需要解决公平性、透明度、可解释性和可信度等技术和社会问题。

Abstract: Powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools that have emerged in recent years
-- including large language models, automated coding assistants, and advanced
image and speech generation technologies -- are the result of monumental human
achievements. These breakthroughs reflect mastery across multiple technical
disciplines and the resolution of significant technological challenges.
However, some of the most profound challenges may still lie ahead. These
challenges are not purely technical but pertain to the fair and responsible use
of AI in ways that genuinely improve the global human condition. This article
explores one promising application aligned with that vision: the use of AI
tools to facilitate and enhance education, with a specific focus on signal
processing (SP). It presents two interrelated perspectives: identifying and
addressing technical limitations, and applying AI tools in practice to improve
educational experiences. Primers are provided on several core technical issues
that arise when using AI in educational settings, including how to ensure
fairness and inclusivity, handle hallucinated outputs, and achieve efficient
use of resources. These and other considerations -- such as transparency,
explainability, and trustworthiness -- are illustrated through the development
of an immersive, structured, and reliable "smart textbook." The article serves
as a resource for researchers and educators seeking to advance AI's role in
engineering education.

### [3] [Ultrafast Deep Learning-Based Scatter Estimation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08973)
*Harshit Agrawal,Ari Hietanen,Simo Särkkä*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究通过在不同分辨率下应用网络并基于速度和准确性选择最优方案，解决了锥束CT散射伪影问题，实现了计算量和内存需求的大幅降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锥束CT扫描中的散射伪影严重降低图像质量，虽然基于深度学习的方法在散射估计方面显示出潜力，但由于网络内存占用大，在移动CBCT系统或边缘设备上的部署仍然受限。

Method: 首先在六个分辨率下比较四种插值方法，检查CBCT散射信号的下采样-上采样重建误差；然后在五个图像分辨率上训练最新的最先进方法，评估浮点运算、推理时间和GPU内存需求的减少。

Result: 减少输入大小和网络参数实现了与基线方法相比78倍的FLOPs减少，同时保持可比的性能（MAPE从4.42%降至3.85%，MSE从2.01×10⁻²降至1.34×10⁻²），推理时间和GPU内存使用分别减少16倍和12倍。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了降采样在基于深度学习的散射估计中被低估的作用，通过大幅减少FLOPs和GPU内存需求，使得在资源受限环境（如移动CBCT和边缘设备）中进行散射校正成为可能。

Abstract: Purpose: Scatter artifacts drastically degrade the image quality of cone-beam
computed tomography (CBCT) scans. Although deep learning-based methods show
promise in estimating scatter from CBCT measurements, their deployment in
mobile CBCT systems or edge devices is still limited due to the large memory
footprint of the networks. This study addresses the issue by applying networks
at varying resolutions and suggesting an optimal one, based on speed and
accuracy.
  Methods: First, the reconstruction error in down-up sampling of CBCT scatter
signal was examined at six resolutions by comparing four interpolation methods.
Next, a recent state-of-the-art method was trained across five image
resolutions and evaluated for the reductions in floating-point operations
(FLOPs), inference times, and GPU memory requirements.
  Results: Reducing the input size and network parameters achieved a 78-fold
reduction in FLOPs compared to the baseline method, while maintaining comarable
performance in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE) and
mean-square-error (MSE). Specifically, the MAPE decreased to 3.85% compared to
4.42%, and the MSE decreased to 1.34 \times 10^{-2} compared to 2.01 \times
10^{-2}. Inference time and GPU memory usage were reduced by factors of 16 and
12, respectively. Further experiments comparing scatter-corrected
reconstructions on a large, simulated dataset and real CBCT scans from water
and Sedentex CT phantoms clearly demonstrated the robustness of our method.
  Conclusion: This study highlights the underappreciated role of downsampling
in deep learning-based scatter estimation. The substantial reduction in FLOPs
and GPU memory requirements achieved by our method enables scatter correction
in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile CBCT and edge devices.

TL;DR: 6G网络设计需要将弹性作为核心目标，通过3R框架（可靠性、鲁棒性、弹性）和边缘原生架构来应对复杂中断，同时考虑技术、架构和经济层面的综合解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动网络从效率优先转向可持续性导向，需要设计能够承受、适应和演进于长期复杂中断的6G系统，将弹性提升为与可持续性和效率同等重要的设计目标。

Method: 采用3R框架（可靠性、鲁棒性、弹性）形式化弹性概念，提出边缘原生和位置感知设计、开放接口、可编程性等架构方案，结合AI原生控制循环、零信任安全和关键流量优先的网络技术。

Result: 建立了包含优雅降级、态势感知、快速重配置和学习驱动改进等可测量能力的弹性框架，提出了9种商业模式组和多种与3R目标一致的模式。

Conclusion: 该白皮书为6G弹性发展提供了初步框架和关键组件，旨在激励研究人员、专业人士和政府官员共同塑造6G弹性的未来发展，强调开放平台和高质量互补者产生的生态系统外部性对增强弹性的重要性。

Abstract: 6G must be designed to withstand, adapt to, and evolve amid prolonged,
complex disruptions. Mobile networks' shift from efficiency-first to
sustainability-aware has motivated this white paper to assert that resilience
is a primary design goal, alongside sustainability and efficiency, encompassing
technology, architecture, and economics. We promote resilience by analysing
dependencies between mobile networks and other critical systems, such as
energy, transport, and emergency services, and illustrate how cascading
failures spread through infrastructures. We formalise resilience using the 3R
framework: reliability, robustness, resilience. Subsequently, we translate this
into measurable capabilities: graceful degradation, situational awareness,
rapid reconfiguration, and learning-driven improvement and recovery.
  Architecturally, we promote edge-native and locality-aware designs, open
interfaces, and programmability to enable islanded operations, fallback modes,
and multi-layer diversity (radio, compute, energy, timing). Key enablers
include AI-native control loops with verifiable behaviour, zero-trust security
rooted in hardware and supply-chain integrity, and networking techniques that
prioritise critical traffic, time-sensitive flows, and inter-domain
coordination.
  Resilience also has a techno-economic aspect: open platforms and high-quality
complementors generate ecosystem externalities that enhance resilience while
opening new markets. We identify nine business-model groups and several
patterns aligned with the 3R objectives, and we outline governance and
standardisation. This white paper serves as an initial step and catalyst for 6G
resilience. It aims to inspire researchers, professionals, government
officials, and the public, providing them with the essential components to
understand and shape the development of 6G resilience.

*Xueyi Wang,C. J. C.,Lamoth,Elisabeth Wilhelm*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了AdaST-Sleep模型，结合卷积层和循环神经网络层来预测睡眠分数，通过领域分类器实现跨用户泛化，在多个时间窗口设置下优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠预测可以帮助个人和医疗提供者提前预测并主动应对影响良好休息的因素，从而改善身心健康。

Method: 提出自适应时空模型(AdaST-Sleep)，使用卷积层捕获多特征间的空间交互，循环神经网络层处理长期时间序列健康数据，并集成领域分类器实现跨用户泛化。

Result: 在5种输入窗口大小(3-11天)和5种预测窗口大小(1-9天)的实验中都优于4个基线模型，最低RMSE为0.282(7天输入窗口+1天预测窗口)，即使预测多天未来也保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为使用商业可穿戴设备稀疏数据和领域自适应技术的个性化睡眠预测提供了稳健且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: A sleep forecast allows individuals and healthcare providers to anticipate
and proactively address factors influencing restful rest, ultimately improving
mental and physical well-being. This work presents an adaptive spatial and
temporal model (AdaST-Sleep) for predicting sleep scores. Our proposed model
combines convolutional layers to capture spatial feature interactions between
multiple features and recurrent neural network layers to handle longer-term
temporal health-related data. A domain classifier is further integrated to
generalize across different subjects. We conducted several experiments using
five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, 11 days) and five predicting window sizes
(1, 3, 5, 7, 9 days). Our approach consistently outperformed four baseline
models, achieving its lowest RMSE (0.282) with a seven-day input window and a
one-day predicting window. Moreover, the method maintained strong performance
even when forecasting multiple days into the future, demonstrating its
versatility for real-world applications. Visual comparisons reveal that the
model accurately tracks both the overall sleep score level and daily
fluctuations. These findings prove that the proposed framework provides a
robust and adaptable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse
data from commercial wearable devices and domain adaptation techniques.

### [6] [Improving the Elevational Focusing of Fast Orthogonal Row-Column Electronic Scanning (FORCES) Ultrasound Imaging using Retrospective Transmit Beamforming (RTB)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09056)
*Michael Caulfield,Randy Palamar,Darren Dahunsi,Mohammad Rahim Sobhani,Negar Majidi,Roger Zemp*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种改进的FORCES成像方案，通过在仰角方向应用回顾性发射波束形成(RTB)技术，解决了传统FORCES方法在焦点外仰角聚焦性能差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FORCES成像方案由于固定的仰角焦点和大的发射孔径，在焦点外的仰角聚焦性能较差，需要改进以提升全图像平面的成像质量。

Method: 在FORCES和uFORCES方法中应用回顾性发射波束形成(RTB)技术，通过在仰角方向进行发射聚焦来改善成像性能。使用囊肿和线状体模进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，应用RTB后，FORCES和uFORCES在焦点外的仰角聚焦能力得到显著改善。在焦点处，性能保持相当或有所提升。通过线状体模的FWHM测量和管状囊肿体模的广义对比度噪声比进行量化评估。

Conclusion: RTB技术有效提升了FORCES成像方案在仰角方向的聚焦性能，实现了全图像平面的发射聚焦，为行-列阵列的容积成像提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent developments in Row Column Arrays (RCAs) have presented promising
options for volumetric imaging without the need for the excessive channel
counts of fully wired 2D-arrays. Bias programmable RCAs, also known as Top
Orthogonal to Bottom Electrode (TOBE) Arrays, show further promise in that
imaging schemes, such as Fast Orthogonal Row-Column Electronic Scanning
(FORCES) allow for full transmit and receive focusing everywhere in the image
plane. However, due to its fixed elevational focus and large transmit aperture,
FORCES experiences poor elevational focusing away from the focal point. In this
study we present a modification to the FORCES imaging scheme by applying
Retrospective Transmit Beamforming (RTB) in the elevational direction to allow
for elevational transmit focusing everywhere in the imaging plane. We evaluate
FORCES and uFORCES methods, with and without RTB applied, when imaging both a
cyst and wire phantom. With experiment we show improved elevational focusing
capabilities away from the focal point when RTB is applied to both FORCES and
uFORCES. At the focal point, performance with RTB remains comparable or
improved relative to standard FORCES. This is quantified by the measurement of
Full Width Half Max when imaging the wire phantom, and by the generalized
Contrast to Noise Ratio when imaging the tubular cyst phantom. We also
demonstrate the volumetric imaging capabilities of FORCES RTB with the wire
phantom.

*Rong Ye,Xue-Qin Jiang,Hui Feng,Jian Wang,Runhe Qiu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对带隐藏节点的符号图学习方法SGL-HNCS，通过列稀疏正则化和块坐标下降法来重构符号图拉普拉斯矩阵


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号图学习通常假设所有节点都可见，但在实际应用中经常只有部分节点可观测，其余节点保持隐藏状态，需要解决这一挑战

Method: 基于图信号在符号图上的平滑性假设，将拓扑推断建模为带列稀疏正则化的约束优化问题，使用定制化的块坐标下降(BCD)方法求解

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据上的实验结果表明所提出的SGL-HNCS方法具有高效性

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理存在隐藏节点的符号图学习问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Signed graphs, which are characterized by both positive and negative edge
weights, have recently attracted significant attention in the field of graph
signal processing (GSP). Existing works on signed graph learning typically
assume that all graph nodes are available. However, in some specific
applications, only a subset of nodes can be observed while the remaining nodes
stay hidden. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method for
identifying signed graph that accounts for hidden nodes, termed \textit{signed
graph learning with hidden nodes under column-sparsity regularization}
(SGL-HNCS). Our method is based on the assumption that graph signals are smooth
over signed graphs, i.e., signal values of two nodes connected by positive
(negative) edges are similar (dissimilar). Rooted in this prior assumption, the
topology inference of a signed graph is formulated as a constrained
optimization problem with column-sparsity regularization, where the goal is to
reconstruct the signed graph Laplacian matrix without disregarding the
influence of hidden nodes. We solve the constrained optimization problem using
a tailored block coordinate descent (BCD) approach. Experimental results using
synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
SGL-HNCS method.

### [8] [Sequential Spectral Clustering of Data Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09144)
*G Dhinesh Chandran,Kota Srinivas Reddy,Srikrishna Bhashyam*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种序列谱聚类算法（SEQ-SPEC和IA-SEQ-SPEC），用于数据序列的非参数聚类，在有限样本下实现指数一致性，性能优于固定样本和传统序列聚类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据序列的非参数聚类问题，其中每个序列由未知分布的i.i.d.样本组成。传统方法需要固定样本量，而序列框架可以在给定错误概率下通过观察最少数量的样本来估计聚类。

Method: 提出SEQ-SPEC算法和计算效率更高的IA-SEQ-SPEC算法。SEQ-SPEC基于谱聚类算法，在序列框架下逐步收集样本并更新聚类结果。IA-SEQ-SPEC通过增量近似方法提高计算效率。

Result: 算法几乎必然在有限时间内停止且具有指数一致性。模拟实验显示，两种算法在合成和真实数据集上均优于固定样本SPEC、SEQ-KMED和SEQ-SLINK算法。IA-SEQ-SPEC在计算高效的同时，性能接近SEQ-SPEC。

Conclusion: 这是首个在序列框架下进行数据序列谱聚类的工作，提出的算法在保证性能的同时显著提高了计算效率，为序列数据聚类提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of nonparametric clustering of data sequences, where
each data sequence comprises i.i.d. samples generated from an unknown
distribution. The true clusters are the clusters obtained using the Spectral
clustering algorithm (SPEC) on the pairwise distance between the true
distributions corresponding to the data sequences. Since the true distributions
are unknown, the objective is to estimate the clusters by observing the minimum
number of samples from the data sequences for a given error probability. To
solve this problem, we propose the Sequential Spectral clustering algorithm
(SEQ-SPEC), and show that it stops in finite time almost surely and is
exponentially consistent. We also propose a computationally more efficient
algorithm called the Incremental Approximate Sequential Spectral clustering
algorithm (IA-SEQ-SPEC). Through simulations, we show that both our proposed
algorithms perform better than the fixed sample size SPEC, the Sequential
$K$-Medoids clustering algorithm (SEQ-KMED) and the Sequential Single Linkage
clustering algorithm (SEQ-SLINK). The IA-SEQ-SPEC, while being computationally
efficient, performs close to SEQ-SPEC on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on spectral
clustering of data sequences under a sequential framework.

### [9] [JFRFFNet: A Data-Model Co-Driven Graph Signal Denoising Model with Partial Prior Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09147)
*Ziqi Yan,Zhichao Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据-模型协同驱动的去噪方法JFRFFNet，将JFRFT域维纳滤波器嵌入神经网络，通过数据驱动方式更新变换阶数对和滤波器系数，仅需部分先验信息即可有效去噪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统滤波方法需要完整的图信号先验信息，要么通过网格搜索确定变换阶数对和计算滤波器系数，要么使用梯度下降策略优化，限制了实际应用。

Method: 将联合时-顶点分数阶傅里叶变换域的维纳滤波器模型嵌入神经网络架构，通过数据驱动方式联合优化变换阶数对和滤波器系数。

Result: 实验表明JFRFFNet在输出信噪比方面相比现有最先进方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据-模型协同驱动方法能够仅使用部分先验信息实现有效的时变图信号去噪，为图信号处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Wiener filtering in the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform
(JFRFT) domain has shown high effectiveness in denoising time-varying graph
signals. Traditional filtering models use grid search to determine the
transform-order pair and compute filter coefficients, while learnable ones
employ gradient-descent strategies to optimize them; both require complete
prior information of graph signals. To overcome this shortcoming, this letter
proposes a data-model co-driven denoising approach, termed neural-network-aided
joint time-vertex fractional Fourier filtering (JFRFFNet), which embeds the
JFRFT-domain Wiener filter model into a neural network and updates the
transform-order pair and filter coefficients through a data-driven approach.
This design enables effective denoising using only partial prior information.
Experiments demonstrate that JFRFFNet achieves significant improvements in
output signal-to-noise ratio compared with some state-of-the-art methods.

### [10] [On Sampling of Multiple Correlated Stochastic Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09225)
*Lin Jin,Hang Sheng,Hui Feng,Bo Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用多通道信号统计相关性的高效采样方法，通过建模为少量不相关潜在源的线性组合，建立了零均方误差重构的理论采样密度下界，并开发了达到该下界的多频带采样方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多通道随机信号存在统计相关性，但传统独立采样方法导致数据冗余。为了利用这种相关性实现高效采样，需要开发能够减少冗余的新采样方法。

Method: 将相关通道建模为少量不相关、宽平稳潜在源的线性组合，通过潜在源的频谱分割，然后进行时空采样和插值来实现多频带采样。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在理论采样密度下实现了近乎无损的重构，验证了其效率。

Conclusion: 提出的多频带采样方案能够有效利用信号间的统计相关性，达到理论最优采样效率，为多通道信号处理提供了高效采样解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple stochastic signals possess inherent statistical correlations, yet
conventional sampling methods that process each channel independently result in
data redundancy. To leverage this correlation for efficient sampling, we model
correlated channels as a linear combination of a smaller set of uncorrelated,
wide-sense stationary latent sources. We establish a theoretical lower bound on
the total sampling density for zero mean-square error reconstruction, proving
it equals the ratio of the joint spectral bandwidth of latent sources to the
number of correlated signal channels. We then develop a constructive multi-band
sampling scheme that attains this bound. The proposed method operates via
spectral partitioning of the latent sources, followed by spatio-temporal
sampling and interpolation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm
that our scheme achieves near-lossless reconstruction precisely at the
theoretical sampling density, validating its efficiency.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了改进的黎曼土豆场(iRPF)方法，用于EEG信号伪迹自动去除，在多个指标上显著优于现有方法，处理速度快，适合大规模EEG数据处理和实时应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号清洗是研究领域的关键挑战，现有方法依赖人工超参数调优、对异常值敏感且计算成本高，而人工视觉检查耗时且主观，不适用于大规模EEG研究。

Method: 开发了改进的黎曼土豆场(iRPF)方法，这是一种快速、全自动的EEG伪迹去除方法，解决了当前方法的关键局限性。

Result: iRPF在多个指标上优于所有竞争对手，召回率提升22%，特异性提升102%，精确度提升54%，F1分数提升24%，统计显著性p<0.001，效应量大(Cohen's d>0.8)，处理速度每epoch小于8毫秒。

Conclusion: iRPF为脑机接口和临床神经影像应用提供了强大、数据驱动的伪迹去除解决方案，适用于高质量EEG预处理。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signal cleaning has long been a critical
challenge in the research community. The presence of artifacts can
significantly degrade EEG data quality, complicating analysis and potentially
leading to erroneous interpretations. While various artifact rejection methods
have been proposed, the gold standard remains manual visual inspection by human
experts-a process that is time-consuming, subjective, and impractical for
large-scale EEG studies. Existing techniques are often hindered by a strong
reliance on manual hyperparameter tuning, sensitivity to outliers, and high
computational costs. In this paper, we introduce the improved Riemannian Potato
Field (iRPF), a fast and fully automated method for EEG artifact rejection that
addresses key limitations of current approaches. We evaluate iRPF against
several state-of-the-art artifact rejection methods, using two publicly
available EEG databases, labeled for various artifact types, comprising 226 EEG
recordings. Our results demonstrate that iRPF outperforms all competitors
across multiple metrics, with gains of up to 22% in recall, 102% in
specificity, 54% in precision, and 24% in F1-score, compared to Isolation
Forest, Autoreject, Riemannian Potato, and Riemannian Potato Field,
respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these
improvements (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8) in most
comparisons. Additionally, on a typical EEG recording iRPF performs artifact
cleaning in under 8 milliseconds per epoch using a standard laptop,
highlighting its efficiency for large-scale EEG data processing and real-time
applications. iRPF offers a robust and data-driven artifact rejection solution
for high-quality EEG pre-processing in brain-computer interfaces and clinical
neuroimaging applications.

### [12] [On the Relation of Characteristic Modes of Different Conducting Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09282)
*Leonardo Mörlein,Dirk Manteuffel*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了基于特征模式的散射分析形式化方法，允许使用共同的特征模式基来分析不同结构，并定义了模态变换矩阵来描述特征场与权重系数之间的映射关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了能够使用统一的基础来分析比较不同导电结构的散射特性，特别是当这些结构具有包含关系时，需要建立一种形式化的分析方法。

Method: 推导了基于特征模式的散射分析形式化方法，定义了模态变换矩阵来描述不同结构特征场与权重系数之间的映射关系，并通过两个示例进行验证和应用。

Result: 证明了在这种情况下散射矩阵和扰动矩阵不再是对角矩阵，建立了模态变换矩阵来实现不同基之间的扰动矩阵转换。

Conclusion: 该形式化方法为分析具有包含关系的不同结构提供了有效的理论基础，并在天线设计过程中展示了实际应用价值。

Abstract: A formalism is derived to analyze the scattering of a conducting structure
based on the characteristic modes of another structure whose surface is a
superset of the first structure. This enables the analysis and comparison of
different structures using a common basis of characteristic modes.
Additionally, it is shown that the scattering matrices and perturbation
matrices are no longer diagonal in these cases. Based on this, a modal
transformation matrix is defined to describe the mapping between the
characteristic fields and the weighting coefficients of the two structures.
This matrix enables the conversion of the perturbation matrices in different
bases. Finally, two examples are provided along with a discussion of some
aspects of the theory. The first example aims to validate and illustrate the
formalism. The second example shows how the formalism can be applied in the
design process of an antenna element that is gradually modified, starting from
a base structure.

Abstract: Pixel-based fluid antennas provide enhanced multiplexing gains and quicker
radiation pattern switching than traditional designs. However, this innovation
introduces challenges for channel estimation and analog precoding due to the
state-non-separable channel response problem. This paper explores a multiuser
MIMO-OFDM system utilizing pixel-based fluid antennas, informed by measurements
from a real-world prototype. We present a sparse channel recovery framework for
uplink channel sounding, employing an approximate separable channel response
model with DNN-based antenna radiation functions. We then propose two
low-complexity channel estimation algorithms that leverage orthogonal matching
pursuit and variational Bayesian inference to accurately recover channel
responses across various scattering cluster angles. These estimations enable
the prediction of composite channels for all fluid antenna states, leading to
an analog precoding scheme that optimally selects switching states for
different antennas. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed approach
significantly outperforms several baseline methods, especially in high
signal-to-noise ratio environments with numerous users.

Abstract: Accurate pathloss prediction is essential for the design and optimization of
UAV-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks. While deep learning approaches
have shown strong potential, their generalization across diverse environments,
robustness to noisy inputs, and sensitivity to UAV altitude remain
underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose a UNet-based deep
learning architecture that combines multi-scale feature extraction,
convolution-based feature fusion, and an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP)
bottleneck for efficient context aggregation. The model predicts pathloss maps
from log-distance, line-of-sight (LOS) mask, and building mask inputs. In
addition, we develop a fully vectorized LOS mask computation algorithm that
significantly accelerates pre-processing and enables large-scale dataset
generation. Extensive evaluations on both in-house ray-tracing data and the
RadioMapSeer benchmark demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms several
state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and efficiency. All source code is
publicly released to support reproducibility and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估神经网络的样本级不确定性量化对高风险应用决策至关重要，但传统加性分解方法受到质疑

Conclusion: 提出了新的不确定性估计和分解框架，挑战了传统的加性分解方法，为高风险应用提供了更可靠的不确定性量化

Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is
essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common
approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation
models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic
(model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive
decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an
intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the
signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model
predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a
confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the
existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对奖励信号受到对抗性破坏的鲁棒Q学习算法，在异步采样模型下证明了有限时间收敛性，匹配非对抗情况下的收敛率，并建立了信息理论下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中的奖励信号可能受到极端噪声、传感器故障或恶意攻击的对抗性破坏，这会严重降低传统算法（如Q学习）的性能，因此需要开发能够有效应对这种破坏的鲁棒算法。

Method: 提出了一种新的可证明鲁棒的Q学习变体算法，该算法即使在部分观测奖励被对手任意扰动的情况下也能有效运行。还提出了一个不需要先验了解真实奖励分布统计信息的算法变体，利用了改进的Azuma-Hoeffding不等式技术工具。

Result: 在异步采样模型下，尽管存在对抗性破坏，算法的有限时间收敛率与非对抗情况下的现有结果相匹配，仅增加了一个与损坏样本比例成正比的附加项。建立了信息理论下界，证明上界中的附加破坏项是不可避免的。

Conclusion: 这项工作为异步Q学习提供了首个有限时间鲁棒性保证，填补了鲁棒强化学习领域的重要空白，所提出的技术工具可能具有独立的学术价值。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,
infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is
subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from
extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the
performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this
challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm
that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are
arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model
with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,
the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing
results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to
the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is
unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge
of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this
setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a
refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool
that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide
the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning,
bridging a significant gap in robust RL.

TL;DR: 提出了一个改进的矩阵乘性权重更新算法，在矩阵学习专家建议问题上实现了实例最优的遗憾界O(√(T·S(X||d⁻¹I_d)))，同时保持与经典MMWU相同的计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典MMWU算法在矩阵LEA问题上只能达到最小最大最优遗憾界，但无法实现实例最优性能。本文旨在开发一个既能保持计算效率又能获得更好遗憾界的算法。

Method: 开发了基于势函数的通用框架，MMWU是其特例。通过新的单边Jensen迹不等式和Laplace变换技术，应用超越指数势的一般势函数。最终采用基于虚误差函数的最优势函数。

Result: 新算法实现了量子相对熵度量的实例最优遗憾界，计算复杂度与MMWU相同。在量子态学习、去极化噪声、随机量子态和Gibbs态学习等应用中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该改进算法在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了性能，为量子学习理论提供了强大的新工具，能够有效预测非线性量子特性。

Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning
algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the
Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,
it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present
an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,
$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum
relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational
complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is
``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix
LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential
potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace
inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application
of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm
is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA
problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and
explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show
that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted
by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition,
applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear
quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$
correlation.

TL;DR: STRIDE是一个可扩展的XAI框架，通过RKHS中的正交函数分解避免特征子集枚举，提供功能组件而非单一标量归因，在表格数据上实现3倍中值加速和高保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有XAI框架的两个主要限制：特征子集枚举的指数级计算成本和将效果总结为单一标量值的表达能力不足问题。

Method: 基于再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)的正交函数分解方法，通过递归核中心化程序的分析投影方案计算功能组件f_S(x_S)，避免显式子集枚举。

Result: 在10个数据集上实现中值约3倍的加速(范围0.6-9.7倍)，保持高保真度(R^2在0.81-0.999之间)，并在大多数数据集上具有显著的排序一致性。

Conclusion: STRIDE通过提供结构化功能视角补充了标量归因方法，支持新颖的诊断功能如'组件手术'来量化特定交互的影响。

Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact
of specific interactions within our experimental scope.

Result: 在真实世界数据上验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 所提框架能够有效处理群体分布不确定性，提升最差群体性能，适用于噪声和非平稳环境

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models critically depends on the
quality and representativeness of the training data. In applications with
multiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn
spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for
atypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by
optimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically
assume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately
estimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in
noisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each
group, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the
worst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to
solve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities,
yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit
current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a
foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a
dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation,
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal
dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first
distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the
Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction
Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across
multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal
classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease
detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy,
as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides
risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion,
FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable
solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic
precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code
after acceptance.

Motivation: 分析LRP类归因方法的数值特性，特别是研究归因值的分布规律和收敛性质，为多数据增强场景和Smoothgrad类方法提供理论支撑。

Method: 将LRP归因方法表示为修正梯度矩阵的乘积形式，推导奇异值上界和分量级界限，应用这些界限获得控制收敛的乘法常数。

Result: 发现LRP-beta的常数与权重范数无关，这与基于梯度的方法和LRP-epsilon形成显著区别，对多数据增强和Smoothgrad类方法有重要影响。

Conclusion: 该分析揭示了LRP-beta方法在数值稳定性方面的优势，为归因方法的理论分析和实际应用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

Conclusion: 碳感知的客户端选择和调度策略能有效减少联邦学习的碳排放，同时维持模型准确性，为绿色机器学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Training large-scale machine learning models incurs substantial carbon
emissions. Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across
geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage
regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper
investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client
selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a
carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest
extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training
rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of
such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,
selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To
leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that
integrates slack time, $\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global
fine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler
outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a
wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon
constraints.

Abstract: Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is
inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a framework that
integrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with
visualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters.
PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and
elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer
mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of
the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional
design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.
Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the
learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives
into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding
of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and
linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge
discovery.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,
especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.

Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the
contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on
forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast
that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method,
achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a
2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well
as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally
efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven
weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast
models.

TL;DR: 这篇范围综述分析了机器学习在电力系统保护和扰动管理中的应用，发现虽然ML模型在仿真数据上表现良好，但缺乏真实场景验证，存在方法不一致和标准化不足的问题，并提出了改进指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可再生能源和分布式能源的集成改变了现代电力系统，对传统保护方案构成挑战，需要评估机器学习在电力系统保护中的应用现状和潜力。

Method: 采用PRISMA范围综述框架，基于100多篇文献进行系统分析，评估ML在保护任务中的研究范围、性能表现和适用方法。

Result: ML模型在仿真数据集上通常表现出高准确性，但在真实条件下的性能验证不足；现有文献存在方法严谨性、数据集质量和评估指标不一致的问题。

Conclusion: 需要建立标准化报告实践、完善数据集文档、提高方法透明度，未来研究应关注真实验证、鲁棒性测试和部署可行性，推动ML保护从理论走向实际应用。

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习中选择泛化能力好的模型具有挑战性，Rashomon效应表明同一问题存在多个性能相似但解释不同的模型，需要利用这种多样性来提升泛化性能

Method: 基于模型性能和解释对模型进行分组，构建集成使每个模型覆盖解空间的不同区域，在保持预测精度的同时最大化多样性

Result: 在开放和专有真实数据集上验证，当Rashomon比例较大时AUROC提升高达0.20+，在多个实际应用中展示了稳健性和有效性

Conclusion: Rashomon Ensemble方法通过战略性地选择多样化高性能模型构建集成，有效提高了模型对分布偏移和未见数据的鲁棒性，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Creating models from past observations and ensuring their effectiveness on
new data is the essence of machine learning. However, selecting models that
generalize well remains a challenging task. Related to this topic, the Rashomon
Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given
learning problem. This often occurs in real-world scenarios, like the
manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead
to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a
method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing
solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their
performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity
while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model
covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust
to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach
on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating
up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large.
Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various
real-world applications, highlighting the robustness, practicality, and
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a
foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main
tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use
of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of
observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by
group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show
that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is
obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical
step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.

TL;DR: Sensitivity-LoRA是一种高效的LLM微调方法，通过基于权重矩阵的全局和局部敏感度动态分配秩，解决了传统LoRA方法统一秩分配的问题，具有更好的计算效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法对所有增量矩阵使用统一的秩分配，而现有的秩分配技术计算效率低、复杂且不稳定，限制了实际应用。需要一种更高效的秩分配方法来优化LLM的微调过程。

Method: 提出Sensitivity-LoRA方法，利用损失函数的二阶导数（Hessian矩阵）来捕捉权重敏感度，基于全局和局部敏感度动态分配秩，以最小计算开销实现最优秩分配。

Result: 实验结果表明，Sensitivity-LoRA在各种任务和基准测试中都表现出强大的有效性、效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: Sensitivity-LoRA通过动态秩分配机制，有效解决了传统LoRA方法的局限性，为资源受限环境下的LLM专业化微调提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and
scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to
specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to
LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.
However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each
incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing
this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering
practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose
Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates
ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It
leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to
effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with
minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated
robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across
diverse tasks and benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统机器学习和深度学习模型基于相关性学习，难以区分真实因果关系和虚假关联，限制了模型的鲁棒性、可解释性和泛化能力

Method: 整合多元格兰杰因果关系(MVGC)和PCMCI+进行因果特征选择，构建混合神经网络架构，使用43年北极海冰范围数据及相关海洋-大气变量

Result: 实验结果表明，引入因果输入在不同预测时间尺度上都能提高预测准确性和可解释性，同时减少不必要特征并提升计算效率

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于北极海冰预测，还可广泛应用于其他动态高维领域，为因果感知预测建模提供了可扩展的理论基础和实践方法

Abstract: Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法难以处理需要高频或非规则时间间隔交互的复杂动态系统，连续时间RL虽然有望解决但局限于单智能体领域，主要面临维度灾难和多智能体集中值函数近似困难两大挑战。

Method: 使用物理信息神经网络(PINNs)近似HJB方程的值函数，引入值梯度迭代(VGI)模块通过迭代优化轨迹上的值梯度来确保值与微分结构的一致性，提高梯度保真度。

Result: 在连续时间版本的多智能体粒子环境和多智能体MuJoCo基准测试中，该方法 consistently优于现有连续时间RL基线方法，并能扩展到复杂多智能体动态系统。

Conclusion: 所提出的CT-MARL框架成功解决了连续时间多智能体强化学习中的关键挑战，通过PINNs和VGI模块实现了高效的值函数近似和策略学习，为复杂动态系统的多智能体控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习模型预测ISP对等互联伙伴选择，XGBoost模型在公开数据上达到98%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISP之间的对等互联过程复杂耗时，自动化选择对等伙伴可以提高全球互联网生态系统的效率

Method: 从PeeringDB、CAIDA等公开数据库收集ISP数据，评估树基、神经网络和Transformer三类机器学习模型

Result: 树基模型（特别是XGBoost）表现最佳，准确率达98%，对时间、空间变化和缺失数据具有强韧性

Conclusion: 该方法可实现ISP对等伙伴选择的全自动化，推动互联网生态系统向更高效优化方向发展

Abstract: Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide
global connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,
ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering
relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering
offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often
involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection
can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of
publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that
can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public
databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we
evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting
peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.
Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and
efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly
available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in
predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great
resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that
ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection
process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet
ecosystem.

TL;DR: HISPASpoof是首个大规模西班牙语合成语音检测数据集，包含6种口音的真实语音和6种零样本文本转语音系统生成的合成语音，用于解决西班牙语在语音取证领域的代表性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前零样本语音克隆和文本转语音技术快速发展，但西班牙语（全球超过6亿人使用）在语音取证领域缺乏代表性数据集，现有英语和中文检测器无法有效泛化到西班牙语。

Method: 构建HISPASpoof数据集，包含来自公开语料库的6种口音真实语音和6种零样本TTS系统生成的合成语音，评估5种代表性检测方法在西班牙语上的性能。

Result: 在英语上训练的检测器无法泛化到西班牙语，而在HISPASpoof上训练显著提高了检测性能，同时评估了合成语音溯源（识别生成方法）的表现。

Conclusion: HISPASpoof为推进西班牙语可靠和包容性语音取证提供了关键基准，填补了西班牙语在语音防伪检测领域的空白。

Abstract: Zero-shot Voice Cloning (VC) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) methods have advanced
rapidly, enabling the generation of highly realistic synthetic speech and
raising serious concerns about their misuse. While numerous detectors have been
developed for English and Chinese, Spanish-spoken by over 600 million people
worldwide-remains underrepresented in speech forensics. To address this gap, we
introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for
synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public
corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot
TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors
trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof
substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution
performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic
speech. HISPASpoof thus provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable
and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish.

Result: 方法在多种信噪比条件下显著减少浮点运算量，同时保持竞争力精度，自适应策略能根据信道质量动态调整合并强度

Conclusion: 为未来边缘智能系统中部署基于transformer的语义通信提供了可扩展且高效的方法

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

TL;DR: FSPO是一种序列级强化学习方法，通过在重要性采样权重空间实施长度公平裁剪来解决PPO/GRPO方法在序列长度上的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PPO/GRPO方法在序列级RL中存在长度偏差问题，固定裁剪范围会系统性地重加权短响应和长响应，扭曲有效目标。

Method: 提出FSPO方法，使用高斯动机的解决方案：用KL校正漂移项和√L缩放的带对序列对数IS比率进行裁剪。

Result: FSPO在不同长度区间上平整了裁剪率，稳定了训练过程，在多个评估数据集上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: FSPO通过长度公平裁剪机制有效解决了序列级RL中的长度偏差问题，提供了理论保证和实证优势。

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

TL;DR: 当前深度学习天气模型的评估指标存在"统计相似性陷阱"，奖励模糊预测但错过罕见高影响事件。本文提出DART框架，通过双解码器架构和物理驱动的过采样等方法，专门针对极端对流检测进行优化，显著提高了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的天气模型评估指标倾向于奖励统计上相似但模糊的预测，而忽略了罕见但高影响的极端天气事件（如危险对流），这在实际应用中可能导致严重后果。

Method: 提出DART（Dual Architecture for Regression Tasks）框架，采用双解码器架构进行背景/极端分解，结合物理驱动的过采样技术和任务特定的损失函数，将粗粒度大气预报转换为高分辨率卫星亮温场。

Result: DART在极端对流检测方面取得显著改进：CSI达到0.273（基线为0.00），偏差为2.52（基线为6.72）；去除集成水汽输送（IVT）使检测性能提升270%；训练时间短于10分钟，并可无缝集成到现有气象工作流中。

Conclusion: DART框架成功解决了混合转换-分割-降尺度任务，为极端天气预警提供了可信的AI解决方案，通过专门的架构设计避免了统计相似性陷阱，在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

Motivation: 约束强化学习在连续控制环境中需要在奖励最大化和约束满足之间取得平衡，但现有策略优化方法在约束边界附近表现不稳定，导致训练性能不佳。

Method: 引入自适应激励机制，在接近约束边界前保持约束范围内；提出IP3O算法，通过渐进增加惩罚来稳定训练动态。

Result: 在基准环境上的实证评估显示，IP3O相比最先进的安全RL算法表现出更好的效能。

Conclusion: IP3O算法有效解决了约束强化学习的训练稳定性问题，并提供了理论保证，推导了算法最优性的最坏情况误差界限。

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while
adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific
safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents
govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and
constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization
methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in
suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the
reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the
constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally
Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that
enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics.
Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the
efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL
algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound
on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.

Abstract: Agro-tourism serves as a strategic economic model designed to facilitate
rural development by diversifying income streams for local communities like
farmers while promoting the conservation of indigenous cultural heritage and
traditional agricultural practices. As a very booming subdomain of tourism,
there is a need to study the strategies for the growth of Agro-tourism in
detail. The current study has identified the important indicators for the
growth and enhancement of agro-tourism. The study is conducted in two phases:
identification of the important indicators through a comprehensive literature
review and in the second phase state-of-the-art techniques were used to
identify the important indicators for the growth of agro-tourism. The
indicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models
for feature selection were applied and it was observed that the Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with, the machine
Learning Classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forest (RF) Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) models were
used to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism. The results show that with the
LASSO method, LR model gives the highest classification accuracy of 98% in
70-30% train-test data followed by RF with 95% accuracy. Similarly, in the
80-20% train-test data LR maintains the highest accuracy at 99%, while DT and
XGBoost follow with 97% accuracy.

*Jakob Nyberg,Pontus Johnson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vejde框架结合数据抽象、图神经网络和强化学习，为具有丰富结构化状态的决策问题生成归纳策略函数，能够处理不同规模和结构的问题，并在未见过的测试实例上表现出良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具有丰富结构化状态（如对象类和关系）的决策问题，传统方法难以处理变化的问题规模和结构，需要能够归纳泛化的策略函数。

Method: 将MDP状态表示为实体事实数据库，转换为二分图，通过神经消息传递映射到潜在状态。使用监督学习和强化学习训练策略，处理不同规模的结构化问题。

Result: 在8个RDDL问题域的测试中，Vejde代理在未见过的测试实例上平均得分接近实例特定的MLP代理，且没有显著性能损失，优于在线规划算法Prost。

Conclusion: Vejde框架能够有效生成可泛化的归纳策略，在结构化决策问题中表现出色，为处理复杂关系型状态提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction,
graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances
that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM-free方法推理快但性能欠佳，LLM-based方法性能好但推理慢且资源消耗大，需要一种兼顾性能与效率的解决方案

Method: 采用知识蒸馏技术，从大型语言模型(LLM)中提取领域知识和推理能力来辅助预测，提升模拟性能

Result: 在问答模拟和知识追踪任务上都取得了强劲的结果，实现了性能与效率的平衡

Conclusion: LDSim方法通过LLM知识蒸馏有效提升了问答模拟器的性能，为教育推荐系统提供了高质量的训练数据生成方案

Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student
learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to
questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to
collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,
thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from
undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two
categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:
(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer
the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based
on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain
knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free
methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In
contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of
slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we
propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills
domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist
prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task
and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出MMT-FD方法，通过多注意力元变换器和少样本无监督学习解决旋转机械故障诊断中标注数据稀缺和模型泛化能力不足的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旋转机械智能故障诊断需要大量标注数据，但在实际工业应用中获取足够数据既困难又昂贵，且不同设备需要单独训练诊断模型，缺乏泛化性

Method: 集成时频域编码器和元学习泛化模型，使用时频域随机增强预测状态表示，通过元学习网络进行分类和泛化训练，再用少量标注数据微调，采用对比学习迭代优化

Result: 在轴承故障数据集和转子试验台数据上验证，仅需1%标注样本数据即可达到99%故障诊断准确率，表现出强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: MMT-FD框架能有效提取无标注数据中的潜在故障特征，具有高效率和高泛化性，适用于各类机械设备的故障诊断

Abstract: The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Method: 提出熵调制策略梯度（EMPG）框架，基于步骤不确定性和最终任务结果重新校准学习信号，包括放大自信正确动作的更新、惩罚自信错误、衰减不确定步骤的更新，并引入未来清晰度奖励项

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和DeepSearch三个挑战性智能体任务上的综合实验表明，EMPG实现了显著的性能提升，明显优于强策略梯度基线方法

Conclusion: EMPG通过解耦策略梯度幅度与熵的关系，有效解决了LLM智能体在长时任务中的学习效率问题，为稀疏奖励环境下的强化学习提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it
difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

Conclusion: DRSALife框架是少数能够在无物理先验知识情况下成功学习软人工生命规则集并识别反应扩散系统的方法之一

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity,
particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are
widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,
epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.
A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification
when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to
address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,
such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for
reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the
applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft
Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately
represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.
This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game
of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is
one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning
and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior
knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive
findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy
and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we
successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics
with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to
Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

Motivation: 传统GNN依赖局部消息传递，难以捕捉复杂高阶子图模式，现有基于随机游走的方法仅限于图级任务且配置固定，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出MoSE框架：使用匿名游走提取信息子图，基于结构语义动态路由给专门专家网络，在SWL测试框架下理论证明其表达能力。

Conclusion: MoSE提供了灵活且可解释的子图表示学习框架，能有效捕捉多样化的子图结构模式，理论表达能力强于SWL。

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning
from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing
restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns.
leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have
attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk
kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for
graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks
such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder
the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts
(MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation
learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative
subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized
experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse
subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further
provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph
Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.
Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph
experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but
also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the
model.

Motivation: HGR相关系数作为皮尔逊相关系数的非线性扩展，在算法公平性、科学分析和因果发现中有重要应用，但现有可微分计算方法存在偏差-方差权衡问题，影响实际应用的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用用户可配置的多项式核来计算HGR相关系数，提供了比先前方法更强的鲁棒性和更快的计算效率。

Result: 该方法在约束机器学习框架中表现出良好的适用性，能够产生有意义的次梯度作为损失正则化器。

Conclusion: 所提出的多项式核方法为HGR计算提供了更可靠和实用的解决方案，特别适合现实世界应用场景。

Abstract: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) correlation coefficient is an extension
of Pearson's correlation that is not limited to linear correlations, with
potential applications in algorithmic fairness, scientific analysis, and causal
discovery. Recently, novel algorithms to estimate HGR in a differentiable
manner have been proposed to facilitate its use as a loss regularizer in
constrained machine learning applications. However, the inherent
uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly
compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical
concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational
approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering
greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet
almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant
advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable
option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental
analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained
machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful
subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型和超参数选择需要大量专业知识和计算资源的问题，当前基于LLM的方法依赖试错和昂贵API，缺乏可解释性和通用性。

Method: 结合元学习、可解释AI（SHAP解释）和高效LLM推理，利用历史实验结果，采用LLM-as-judge评估来控制输出格式、准确性和完整性。

Result: 在8个医疗影像数据集上使用9个开源轻量级LLM，MetaLLMiX在5/8任务上达到最优结果，响应时间减少99.6-99.9%，在6个数据集上训练速度提升2.4-15.7倍，准确率保持在最佳基线方法的1-5%范围内。

Conclusion: MetaLLMiX框架通过零样本方式实现了高效、低成本的超参数优化，本地部署优于之前的API方法，为自动化深度学习模型选择提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in
deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While
AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based
approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited
interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot
hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI,
and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with
SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained
models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation
to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that
MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO
methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment
outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8
tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times
on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of

Motivation: 研究语言模型如何通过自我生成的反事实解释来向人类解释其决策过程，这对于人机协作至关重要。

Method: 评估LLMs生成的反事实解释是否有效（达到预期结果）和最小（仅做必要修改），在多个LLMs、数据集和评估设置中进行测试。

Result: LLMs通常能生成有效的反事实解释，但缺乏最小性；当要求生成最小修改时，又往往修改过小导致预测不变，存在明显的有效性-最小性权衡问题。

Conclusion: 自我反事实解释作为可解释性工具效果有限甚至可能误导，在关键应用场景中部署LLMs时必须考虑不可靠自我解释对下游决策的影响。

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to
explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of
self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a
model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have
predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that
are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no
more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs
typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little
insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to
generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits
that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is
consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings
suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at
worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to
deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable
self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at

Motivation: 机器学习和地统计学在土壤属性预测中各有优势但方法不同，需要一种能够同时利用环境特征关系和空间结构的混合框架

Method: KpR（克里金先验回归）框架，通过普通克里金生成空间滞后特征来丰富ML模型的空间上下文，使用TabPFN模型进行预测

Result: KpR与TabPFN组合相比其他空间技术和非空间ML算法，提供了更可靠的不确定性估计和更准确的预测，平均R2提高了约30%

Conclusion: KpR与TabPFN是一个强大且通用的数字土壤制图框架，特别适合小样本量的精准农业应用，能够补偿传感数据与土壤属性间弱关系的问题

Abstract: Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks
for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages
the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the
relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We
propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through
engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this
approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of
regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and
probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six
fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,
clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and
in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable
uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several
other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as
well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random
forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%
compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This
improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN
algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR
features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small
sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for
weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal
soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a
very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in
precision agriculture.

Conclusion: fuser算法能够有效处理微生物群落的时空动态变化，在跨环境预测中表现出优越性能，为微生物组网络推断提供了新方法

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our
understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically
analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single
environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic
microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from
different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial
communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological
conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating
both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed
publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time
points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations
using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates
algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same
environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from
multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of
conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not
entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network
inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing
relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard
approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser
generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results
demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing
algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments
(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in
cross-environment (All) scenarios.

Abstract: Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug
discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints.
While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation
quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due
to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise
fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph
Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete
graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of
conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based
techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over
arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration
(PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test
mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in
controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and
distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of
score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for
flexible, multi-property molecular design.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of forecasting urban water dynamics by
developing a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model that incorporates
both endogenous variables (e.g., water height or discharge) and exogenous
factors (e.g., precipitation history and forecast reports). Unlike conventional
forecasting, the proposed model, AquaCast, captures both inter-variable and
temporal dependencies across all inputs, while focusing forecast solely on
endogenous variables. Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer,
eliminating the need to forecast them and enabling the model to attend to their
short-term influences more effectively. We evaluate our approach on the
LausanneCity dataset, which includes measurements from four urban drainage
sensors, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when using only
endogenous variables. Performance also improves with the inclusion of exogenous
variables and forecast reports. To assess generalization and scalability, we
additionally test the model on three large-scale synthesized datasets,
generated from MeteoSwiss records, the Lorenz Attractors model, and the Random
Fields model, each representing a different level of temporal complexity across
100 nodes. The results confirm that our model consistently outperforms existing
baselines and maintains a robust and accurate forecast across both real and
synthetic datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了D2P2-SGD优化器，结合动态差分隐私和随机投影技术，在保证隐私的同时提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPSGD的静态噪声机制影响模型性能边界，且随着模型参数指数增长，随机优化器的学习效率面临挑战

Result: 在不同目标函数上表现出可证明的次线性收敛率，匹配最佳可用率。实验显示在保持隐私的同时显著提高准确性

Conclusion: 动态差分隐私以隐私为代价带来更好的效用，随机投影实现更高效的模型学习

Abstract: Stochastic optimization is a pivotal enabler in modern machine learning,
producing effective models for various tasks. However, several existing works
have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to
privacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy
concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model
performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters,
efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more
challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically
Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we
combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with
automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing
dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It
exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective
functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further
suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random
projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while
maintaining privacy. Our code is available here.

Abstract: Solutions to the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP) in machine learning face
the challenge of high computational costs associated with evaluating various
algorithms' performances on a given dataset. To mitigate this cost, the
meta-learning field can leverage previously executed experiments shared in
online repositories such as OpenML. OpenML provides an extensive collection of
machine learning experiments. However, an analysis of OpenML's records reveals
limitations. It lacks diversity in pipelines, specifically when exploring data
preprocessing steps/blocks, such as scaling or imputation, resulting in limited
representation. Its experiments are often focused on a few popular techniques
within each pipeline block, leading to an imbalanced sample. To overcome the
observed limitations of OpenML, we propose PIPES, a collection of experiments
involving multiple pipelines designed to represent all combinations of the
selected sets of techniques, aiming at diversity and completeness. PIPES stores
the results of experiments performed applying 9,408 pipelines to 300 datasets.
It includes detailed information on the pipeline blocks, training and testing
times, predictions, performances, and the eventual error messages. This
comprehensive collection of results allows researchers to perform analyses
across diverse and representative pipelines and datasets. PIPES also offers
potential for expansion, as additional data and experiments can be incorporated
to support the meta-learning community further. The data, code, supplementary

Motivation: 解决医疗诊断中标记数据有限的问题，探索小样本学习是否能在使用显著较少训练样本的情况下达到与传统深度学习方法相当的性能。

Method: 采用原型网络（Prototypical Networks）结合咳嗽声的频谱图表示，进行多类别和二分类比较，每类仅使用15个支持样本。

Result: 多类别分类准确率达到74.87%，二分类在所有类别对中均超过70%准确率。统计测试显示多类别与二分类模型性能无显著差异。流感最易区分，健康状态最具挑战性。

Conclusion: 小样本学习在医疗诊断中具有可行性，特别是在缺乏大型标记数据集的情况下，多类别分类在此设置中是可行的。

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of few-shot learning for
respiratory sound classification, focusing on coughbased detection of COVID-19,
Flu, and healthy conditions. We leverage Prototypical Networks with spectrogram
representations of cough sounds to address the challenge of limited labeled
data. Our study evaluates whether few-shot learning can enable models to
achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches while
using significantly fewer training samples. Additionally, we compare
multi-class and binary classification models to assess whether multi-class
models can perform comparably to their binary counterparts. Experimental
findings show that few-shot learning models can achieve competitive accuracy.
Our model attains 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification with only 15
support examples per class, while binary classification achieves over 70%
accuracy across all class pairs. Class-wise analysis reveals Flu as the most
distinguishable class, and Healthy as the most challenging. Statistical tests
(paired t-test p = 0.149, Wilcoxon p = 0.125) indicate no significant
performance difference between binary and multiclass models, supporting the
viability of multi-class classification in this setting. These results
highlight the feasibility of applying few-shot learning in medical diagnostics,
particularly when large labeled datasets are unavailable.

Motivation: 联邦学习虽然被广泛研究，但在数据异构性下容易受到对抗攻击，现有防御机制在非IID数据分布下容易失效

Method: 使用基于梯度接近性和差异性的联合双评分系统来评估客户端梯度，采用双重视角方法促进诚实客户端间的自然相似性，同时检测可疑的一致性作为攻击指标

Result: 通过大量数值实验证明，ProDiGy在各种场景下优于现有防御方法，特别是在非IID数据分布时，其他防御机制失效时仍能保持强大的防御能力和模型准确性

Conclusion: 双重视角方法在检测对抗攻击方面非常有效，能够同时促进诚实客户端的自然相似性并识别潜在的攻击行为

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a widely studied paradigm for distributed
learning. Despite its many advantages, FL remains vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, especially under data heterogeneity. We propose a new Byzantine-robust
FL algorithm called ProDiGy. The key novelty lies in evaluating the client
gradients using a joint dual scoring system based on the gradients' proximity
and dissimilarity. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that
ProDiGy outperforms existing defenses in various scenarios. In particular, when
the clients' data do not follow an IID distribution, while other defense
mechanisms fail, ProDiGy maintains strong defense capabilities and model
accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a dual perspective
approach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting
suspicious uniformity as a potential indicator of an attack.

Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across
multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.

Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic
spatio-temporal systems, explicitly conditioned on the parameter values of the
underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves
pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on
a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of
parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is
capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables
computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only
a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes.
We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its
ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator
provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical
integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a
probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification,
allowing for the statistical study of rare events.

Conclusion: ReBaNO算法在计算效率和物理嵌入方面表现优异，为多输入PDE组的算子学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We propose a novel data-lean operator learning algorithm, the Reduced Basis

inputs. Inspired by the Reduced Basis Method and the recently introduced
Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks, ReBaNO relies on a
mathematically rigorous greedy algorithm to build its network structure offline
adaptively from the ground up. Knowledge distillation via task-specific
activation function allows ReBaNO to have a compact architecture requiring
minimal computational cost online while embedding physics. In comparison to
state-of-the-art operator learning algorithms such as PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO,
and CNO, numerical results demonstrate that ReBaNO significantly outperforms
them in terms of eliminating/shrinking the generalization gap for both in- and
out-of-distribution tests and being the only operator learning algorithm
achieving strict discretization invariance.

Conclusion: 提出的解释层方法为概念漂移提供了更全面的诊断视角，使理解模型决策逻辑变化成为可能

Abstract: Machine learning models in dynamic environments often suffer from concept
drift, where changes in the data distribution degrade performance. While
detecting this drift is a well-studied topic, explaining how and why the
model's decision-making logic changes still remains a significant challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by
analyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations
(GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their
associated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These
evolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in
the model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize
this analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines
insights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer
(prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that
such holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making
it possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial
data shift versus a re-labeling of concepts.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction using deep learning (DL) models has accelerated
drug and materials discovery, but the resulting DL models often lack
interpretability, hindering their adoption by chemists. This work proposes
developing molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)
in chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,
a novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical
substructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those
curated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large
molecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR
framework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging
pre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the
proposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of
molecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical
chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and
pharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the
model's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical
principles, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific
functional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property
relationships. Our work presents a significant step toward developing
high-performing, chemically interpretable DL models for molecular discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ButterflyQuant是一种新的2位量化方法，通过可学习的蝴蝶变换替代固定Hadamard变换，自适应处理不同Transformer层的异常值模式，显著提升低精度量化的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转方法使用固定的Hadamard变换无法适应不同权重分布的异常值模式，不同Transformer层表现出不同的异常值特征，需要层自适应的旋转方法。

Method: 提出ButterflyQuant，使用可学习的蝴蝶变换（参数化为连续Givens旋转角度）替代固定Hadamard变换，通过梯度优化学习最佳旋转，并引入均匀性正则化促进量化友好的分布。

Result: 在LLaMA-2-7B模型上，2位量化时ButterflyQuant达到15.4的困惑度，显著优于QuaRot的22.1，且学习过程仅需128个校准样本和单GPU几分钟时间。

Conclusion: ButterflyQuant通过可学习的正交变换有效抑制异常值，在极低比特量化下保持模型性能，计算复杂度为O(n log n)，参数效率高，部署成本低。

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting
deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower
numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic
performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as
QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before
quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} =
(\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these
methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case
coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight
distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct
outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than
one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces
Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by
continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$
entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,
butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization
while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint
ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log
n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable
parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on
post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to
quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in
minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit
quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.

existing given-data Sobol' index method, which allow variance-based sensitivity
analysis to be efficiently performed on large models such as neural networks,
which have $>10^4$ parameterizable inputs. For models of this size, holding all
input-output evaluations simultaneously in memory -- as required by existing
methods -- can quickly become impractical. These extensions also support
nonstandard input distributions with many repeated values, which are not
amenable to equiprobable partitions employed by existing given-data methods.
  Our extensions include a general definition of the given-data Sobol' index
estimator with arbitrary partition, a streaming algorithm to process
input-output samples in batches, and a heuristic to filter out small indices
that are indistinguishable from zero indices due to statistical noise. We show
that the equiprobable partition employed in existing given-data methods can
introduce significant bias into Sobol' index estimates even at large sample
sizes and provide numerical analyses that demonstrate why this can occur. We
also show that our streaming algorithm can achieve comparable accuracy and
runtimes with lower memory requirements, relative to current methods which
process all samples at once. We demonstrate our novel developments on two
application problems in neural network modeling.

Abstract: Many optimization problems in robotics involve the optimization of
time-expensive black-box functions, such as those involving complex simulations
or evaluation of real-world experiments. Furthermore, these functions are often
stochastic as repeated experiments are subject to unmeasurable disturbances.
Bayesian optimization can be used to optimize such methods in an efficient
manner by deploying a probabilistic function estimator to estimate with a given
confidence so that regions of the search space can be pruned away.
Consequently, the success of the Bayesian optimization depends on the function
estimator's ability to provide informative confidence bounds. Existing function
estimators require many function evaluations to infer the underlying confidence
or depend on modeling of the disturbances. In this paper, it is shown that the
confidence bounds provided by the Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimator
(WS-KDE) are applicable as excellent bounds to any stochastic function with an
output confined to the closed interval [0;1] regardless of the distribution of
the output. This finding opens up the use of WS-KDE for stable global
optimization on a wider range of cost functions. The properties of WS-KDE in
the context of Bayesian optimization are demonstrated in simulation and applied
to the problem of automated trap design for vibrational part feeders.

Abstract: Low-degree polynomials have emerged as a powerful paradigm for providing
evidence of statistical-computational gaps across a variety of high-dimensional
statistical models [Wein25]. For detection problems -- where the goal is to
test a planted distribution $\mathbb{P}'$ against a null distribution
$\mathbb{P}$ with independent components -- the standard approach is to bound
the advantage using an $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthonormal family of
polynomials. However, this method breaks down for estimation tasks or more
complex testing problems where $\mathbb{P}$ has some planted structures, so
that no simple $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthogonal polynomial family is
available. To address this challenge, several technical workarounds have been
proposed [SW22,SW25], though their implementation can be delicate. In this
work, we propose a more direct proof strategy. Focusing on random graph models,
we construct a basis of polynomials that is almost orthonormal under
$\mathbb{P}$, in precisely those regimes where statistical-computational gaps
arise. This almost orthonormal basis not only yields a direct route to
establishing low-degree lower bounds, but also allows us to explicitly identify
the polynomials that optimize the low-degree criterion. This, in turn, provides
insights into the design of optimal polynomial-time algorithms. We illustrate
the effectiveness of our approach by recovering known low-degree lower bounds,
and establishing new ones for problems such as hidden subcliques, stochastic
block models, and seriation models.
