Moreover,\npatient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data\nacross institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which\nrely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study\nproposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving\nmechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection\nin diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient\ndescent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises\nfrom insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for\nneural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient\nleakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is\nintegrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local\ndata, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the\nimpracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across\nvarious medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to\naggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the\nadaptability of a model across diverse scenarios.

To\nbridge this gap, we introduce \\emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}\n(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the\nsimplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile\nrewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized\nRL objective.

This structure naturally forms a\nparallelogram for each localized pulse of the AAF of the AFDM chirp subcarrier,\nenabling unambiguous target sensing. Then, we study the cross-ambiguity\nfunction (CAF) between two different AFDM chirp subcarriers, which exhibits the\nsame local and global properties as the AAF but with an additional shift along\nthe Doppler dimension. We then extend our analysis to the AF of various typical\nAFDM frames, considering both deterministic pilot and random data symbols.

However,\ninference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively\nunder-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving\nhigh-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided\nsettings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on\nparticle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs\nsampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using\nconditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process\nensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the\nreward-weighted target distribution.

Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL\ntraining framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner\nacross clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data\nheterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.\nHowever, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting\nin heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge\nlearned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL\nframework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called\nSFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the\ncurrent round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled\nKnowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign\ndistinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based\non the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.\nThrough this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training\nefficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent\nknowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge\ndistillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.\nBased on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection\nmechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge\nspace coverage while reducing communication and computational costs.

Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on\nhigh-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based\nalgorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face\nseveral limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA\nsequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high\ncomputational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are\ninefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is\neven greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the\ncanonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep\nlearning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.\nFurthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far\nlower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning\nframework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for\npredicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA.

Sustainable\nirrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and\ndrying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping\nsecure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a\nkey component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited\ndata on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking\nand targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework\nto monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a\nregion facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect\nessential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's\nPromoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained\napproximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their\nfield-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with\nSentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and\nirrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing\nDSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior\nknowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR\nadoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with\ndistrict-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)\nwith government records.

In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the\nforgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local\noverfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input\nspace. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without\nconventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent\nphenomenon.\n  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages\nthe training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten\nknowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by\ndistilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing\nperformance without added inference cost.\n  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and\ntraining regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the\npresence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge\nDistillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained\nensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference\ncomplexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8861\u91cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9057\u5fd8\u7387\u7684\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u84b8\u998f\uff09\u6765\u6062\u590d\u9057\u5fd8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f88\u5c11\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4e0e\u53cc\u4e0b\u964d\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8861\u91cf\u9057\u5fd8\u7387\u7684\u5206\u6570\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c40\u90e8\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5148\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u518d\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u9057\u5fd8\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5c40\u90e8\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u53cc\u4e0b\u964d\u73b0\u8c61\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c40\u90e8\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u96c6\u6210+\u84b8\u998f\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Notably, most interpretability\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\naccuracy.
