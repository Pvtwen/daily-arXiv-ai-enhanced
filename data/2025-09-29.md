### [1] [Hidden Markov Model Decoding for LDPC Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21872)
*Jan C Olivier,Etienne Barnard*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于迭代隐马尔可夫模型的LDPC码解码方法，通过前向-后向平滑估计器实现高效解码，在短帧长情况下性能优于传统置信传播算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LDPC码解码方法如置信传播在短帧长时性能不佳，需要开发更高效的解码算法来提升解码阈值和误帧率性能。

Method: 使用一阶隐马尔可夫模型作为解码框架，构建时间齐次的固定转移矩阵，通过编码帧比特的随机游走进行建模，隐藏状态包含两个编码比特，将奇偶校验自然融入观测模型。

Result: 提出的解码器显著改善了LDPC码的解码阈值，误帧率和解码阈值性能与采用SCL-CRC解码的Polar码相当，即使在512比特或更短的短帧长和规则LDPC码情况下也能实现。

Conclusion: 基于HMM的迭代解码方法为LDPC码提供了一种高效解码方案，在短帧长场景下具有显著性能优势，可与先进Polar码解码技术相媲美。

Abstract: The paper proposes an iterative Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for decoding a Low
Density Parity Check (LDPC) code. It is demonstrated that a first-order HMM
provides a natural framework for the decoder. The HMM is time-homogeneous with
a fixed transition matrix and is based on a random walk through the encoded
frame bits. Each hidden state contains a pair of two encoded bits, and parity
checks are naturally incorporated into the observation model. The paper shows
that by implementing a forward-backward smoothing estimator for the hidden
states, decoding is efficient and requires only a small number of iterations in
most cases. The results show that the LDPC decoding threshold is significantly
improved compared to belief propagation (BP) on a Tanner graph. Numerical
results are presented showing that LDPC codes under the proposed decoder yield
a frame error rate (FER) and decoding threshold comparable to that of a Polar
code where Successive Cancellation List (SCL) - Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
decoding is deployed. This is shown to be achieved even if the frame length is
short (on the order of $512$ bits or less) and a regular LDPC code is used. 1

### [2] [CRB minimization for PASS Assisted ISAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22181)
*Haochen Li,Ruikang Zhong,Jiayi Lei,Pan Zhiwen,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种多波导PASS辅助的集成感知与通信系统，通过交替优化方法最小化目标感知的克拉美罗下界，在通信质量、功率预算和天线部署约束下实现优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在集成感知与通信系统中同时优化通信和感知性能，需要解决在通信服务质量约束下的目标感知精度最大化问题。

Method: 采用PASS发射-ULA接收的基站配置，通过交替优化方法解决非凸优化问题，优化天线部署和信号传输。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的PASS辅助ISAC框架在性能上优于基准方案。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种有效的PASS辅助ISAC系统，能够在满足通信约束的同时显著提升感知性能。

Abstract: A multiple waveguide PASS assisted integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) system is proposed, where the base station (BS) is equipped with
transmitting pinching antennas (PAs) and receiving uniform linear array (ULA)
antennas. The PASS-transmitting-ULA-receiving (PTUR) BS transmits the
communication and sensing signals through the stretched PAs on waveguides and
collects the echo sensing signals with the mounted ULA. Based on this
configuration, a target sensing Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) minimization problem is
formulated under communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraints, power
budget constraints, and PA deployment constraints. An alternating optimization
(AO) method is employed to address the formulated non-convex optimization
problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PASS assisted ISAC
framework achieves superior performance over benchmark schemes.

### [3] [A Deep Neural Network Codebook Approach for Near-Field Nulling Control Beam Focusing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22204)
*Mohammadhossein Karimi,Yuanzhe Gong,Tho Le-Ngoc*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种用于XL-MIMO近场区域多用户干扰抑制的深度神经网络码本方法，通过分区训练轻量级DNN模型来预测波束赋形权重，在降低计算复杂度的同时实现有效的干扰抑制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于DNN的零陷控制波束赋形方法面临可扩展性和复杂性挑战，特别是在XL-MIMO系统的近场区域中，需要更高效的干扰抑制解决方案。

Method: 使用基于相关性的采样对菲涅尔区域进行分区，为每个子区域分配轻量级全连接DNN模型，使用LCMV方法生成的波束赋形权重进行训练，预测同时优化期望信号强度和抑制干扰的零陷控制波束聚焦权重。

Result: 训练模型在75个样本子区域上实现平均相位误差0.085弧度、幅度误差0.52 dB。Ansys HFSS全波仿真显示干扰抑制优于31.64 dB，与LCMV方法的性能差距在2 dB以内。

Conclusion: 所提出的DNN码本方法在降低计算复杂度的同时，有效缓解了XL-MIMO近场区域的多用户干扰问题，性能接近传统LCMV方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a deep neural network (DNN) codebook approach for
multi-user interference (MUI) mitigation in extremely large multiple-input
multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems operating in the near-field region. Unlike
existing DNN-based nulling control beamforming (NCBF) methods that face
scalability and complexity challenges, the proposed framework partitions the
Fresnel region using correlation-based sampling and assigns a lightweight fully
connected DNN model to each subsection. Each model is trained on beamforming
weights generated using the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV)
method, enabling accurate prediction of nulling control beam-focusing weights
that simultaneously optimize the desired signal strength and suppress potential
interference for both collinear and non-collinear user configurations.
Simulation results show that the trained models achieve average phase and
magnitude prediction errors of 0.085 radians and 0.52 dB, respectively, across
75 sample subsections. Full-wave simulations in Ansys HFSS further demonstrate
that the proposed DNN codebook achieves interference suppression better than
31.64 dB, with a performance gap within 2 dB of the LCMV method, thereby
validating its effectiveness in mitigating MUI while reducing computational
complexity.

### [4] [Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Enhanced Wideband Multiuser MIMO OFDM-IM Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22327)
*Zheao Li,Jiancheng An,Chau Yuen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于OFDM-IM的SIM增强宽带多用户收发器，通过稀疏激活和深度展开优化来解决SIM在宽带部署中的相位张量静态和快速重配置问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可编程超表面在宽带部署中的两个结构性问题：(i) 单一准静态SIM相位张量需要适应所有子载波；(ii) 多用户调度导致子载波激活模式帧间变化，需要快速重配置。

Method: 采用OFDM-IM的稀疏激活特性，将高保真均衡限制在活动音调上；提出基于最差链路BER的可靠性感知设计；开发了UPGD-Net深度展开网络，在SIM层和算法迭代上进行双重展开。

Result: 宽带多用户下行链路仿真显示快速单调收敛、明显的层深最佳点，以及在最差链路BER和总速率方面的一致增益。

Conclusion: 通过将结构稀疏性与BER驱动的深度展开优化相结合，该框架直接解决了SIM在宽带部署中的关键缺陷。

Abstract: Leveraging the multilayer realization of programmable metasurfaces, stacked
intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) enable fine-grained wave-domain control.
However, their wideband deployment is impeded by two structural factors: (i) a
single, quasi-static SIM phase tensor must adapt to all subcarriers, and (ii)
multiuser scheduling changes the subcarrier activation pattern frame by frame,
requiring rapid reconfiguration. To address both challenges, we develop a
SIM-enhanced wideband multiuser transceiver built on orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM). The sparse
activation of OFDM-IM confines high-fidelity equalization to the active tones,
effectively widening the usable bandwidth. To make the design
reliability-aware, we directly target the worst-link bit-error rate (BER) and
adopt a max-min per-tone signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as a
principled surrogate, turning the reliability optimization tractable. For
frame-rate inference and interpretability, we propose an unfolded
projected-gradient-descent network (UPGD-Net) that double-unrolls across the
SIM's layers and algorithmic iterations: each cell computes the analytic
gradient from the cascaded precoder with a learnable per-iteration step size.
Simulations on wideband multiuser downlinks show fast, monotone convergence, an
evident layer-depth sweet spot, and consistent gains in worst-link BER and sum
rate. By combining structural sparsity with a BER-driven, deep-unfolded
optimization backbone, the proposed framework directly addresses the key
wideband deficiencies of SIM.

### [5] [Specific multi-emitter identification via multi-label learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22396)
*Yuhao Chen,Boxiang He,Shilian Wang,Jing Lei*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多标签学习的特定多发射器识别方法，用于从重叠信号中识别多个发射器，具有较低复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特定发射器识别方法无法处理多个发射器信号重叠的场景，需要解决多发射器同时识别的问题。

Method: 设计了多发射器指纹提取器来减轻重叠信号间的相互干扰，并提出了多发射器决策器来使用提取的指纹进行发射器识别。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线方法相比，所提出的SMEI方案在各种重叠条件下实现了相当的识别精度，同时复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法能够以较低复杂度从重叠信号中识别多个发射器，解决了多发射器重叠场景下的识别问题。

Abstract: Specific emitter identification leverages hardware-induced impairments to
uniquely determine a specific transmitter. However, existing approaches fail to
address scenarios where signals from multiple emitters overlap. In this paper,
we propose a specific multi-emitter identification (SMEI) method via
multi-label learning to determine multiple transmitters. Specifically, the
multi-emitter fingerprint extractor is designed to mitigate the mutual
interference among overlapping signals. Then, the multi-emitter decision maker
is proposed to assign the all emitter identification using the previous
extracted fingerprint. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
baseline approach, the proposed SMEI scheme achieves comparable identification
accuracy under various overlapping conditions, while operating at significantly
lower complexity. The significance of this paper is to identify multiple
emitters from overlapped signal with a low complexity.

### [6] [Approximation of the Range Ambiguity Function in Near-field Sensing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22423)
*Marcin Wachowiak,André Bourdoux,Sofie Pollin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了近场系统的距离模糊函数，其中带宽和近场波束聚焦共同决定分辨率。推导了匹配滤波器模糊函数，分析了不同天线阵列几何形状的近场阵列因子，并提出了基于孔径-带宽乘积的近似准则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究近场系统中带宽和波束聚焦如何共同影响距离分辨率，探索近场波束聚焦相比远场情况在模糊函数方面的改进。

Method: 推导了通用的匹配滤波器模糊函数，引入了不同天线阵列几何形状的近场阵列因子，将近场模糊函数近似为距离相关的近场阵列因子与带宽和波形引起的模糊函数的乘积。

Result: 建立了基于孔径-带宽乘积的近似准则并验证了其准确性，展示了近场波束聚焦相比远场情况在分辨率、峰值旁瓣比和积分旁瓣水平方面的性能提升。

Conclusion: 近场区域提供的性能增益是距离相关的，只有在靠近阵列时才显著，近场波束聚焦在近距离能显著改善分辨率性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates the range ambiguity function of near-field systems
where bandwidth and near-field beamfocusing jointly determine the resolution.
First, the general matched filter ambiguity function is derived and the
near-field array factors of different antenna array geometries are introduced.
Next, the near-field ambiguity function is approximated as a product of the
range-dependent near-field array factor and the ambiguity function due to the
utilized bandwidth and waveform. An approximation criterion based on the
aperture-bandwidth product is formulated, and its accuracy is examined.
Finally, the improvements to the ambiguity function offered by the near-field
beamfocusing, as compared to the far-field case, are presented. The performance
gains are evaluated in terms of resolution improvement offered by beamfocusing,
peak-to-sidelobe and integrated-sidelobe level improvement. The gains offered
by the near-field regime are shown to be range-dependent and substantial only
in close proximity to the array.

Method: 首先从杂货店销售数据中发现连续时间马尔可夫链形式的随机过程模型，然后扩展供应活动，最后进行假设分析评估产品数量随时间变化。

Result: 能够识别客户购买行为与供应策略之间的最优平衡，有效防止因过度供应导致的食物浪费和产品短缺。

Conclusion: 该方法为食品零售商提供了有效的工具来优化库存管理，显著减少食物浪费，同时确保产品供应充足。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for analyzing food retail processes with a
focus on reducing food waste. The approach integrates object-centric process
mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. First, a
stochastic process in the form of a continuous-time Markov chain is discovered
from grocery store sales data. This model is then extended with supply
activities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the
quantity of products in the store evolves over time. This enables the
identification of an optimal balance between customer purchasing behavior and
supply strategies, helping to prevent both food waste due to oversupply and
product shortages.

### [8] [Impact of Loss Weight and Model Complexity on Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Computational Fluid Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21393)
*Yi En Chou,Te Hsin Liu,Chao An Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于维度分析的权重方案来改进物理信息神经网络(PINNs)的训练稳定性，其中第二种方案通过结合可量化和不可量化项实现了更平衡的训练，在多个CFD问题上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在求解偏微分方程时对损失权重选择高度敏感，传统等权重方法训练不稳定且精度有限。

Method: 提出了两种基于维度分析的权重方案：第一种仅基于可量化项，第二种同时结合可量化和不可量化项，实现更平衡的训练过程。

Result: 在热传导、对流扩散和空腔驱动流等基准测试中，第二种方案相比等权重方法显著提高了稳定性和精度，特别是在高佩克莱特数对流扩散问题中，传统求解器失效时PINNs仍能获得稳定准确的预测。

Conclusion: 所提出的权重方案增强了PINNs在计算流体动力学问题中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为复杂物理问题的求解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks offer a mesh free framework for solving PDEs
but are highly sensitive to loss weight selection. We propose two dimensional
analysis based weighting schemes, one based on quantifiable terms, and another
also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks
on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that
the second scheme consistently improves stability and accuracy over equal
weighting. Notably, in high Peclet number convection diffusion, where
traditional solvers fail, PINNs with our scheme achieve stable, accurate
predictions, highlighting their robustness and generalizability in CFD
problems.

### [9] [LLMs for Bayesian Optimization in Scientific Domains: Are We There Yet?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21403)
*Rushil Gupta,Jason Hartford,Bang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 评估LLMs作为实验设计代理的能力，发现在遗传扰动和分子属性发现任务中，LLM代理对实验反馈不敏感，传统方法表现更好，提出了结合LLM先验知识和最近邻采样的混合方法LLMNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs是否能作为通用实验设计代理进行上下文实验设计，评估其在真实科学任务中的表现。

Method: 使用开源和闭源指令调优LLMs进行遗传扰动和分子属性发现任务评估，提出LLMNN混合方法结合LLM先验知识和最近邻采样。

Result: LLM代理对实验反馈不敏感，真实结果与随机标签置换结果无差异；传统线性bandits和高斯过程优化方法表现优于LLM代理；LLMNN方法在多个领域达到竞争性或更优性能。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在实践中无法进行上下文实验设计，需要将基于先验的推理与更新后验的批量获取解耦的混合框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose
agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context
experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and
closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and
molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no
sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly
permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical
methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently
outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided
Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with
nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves
competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring
significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and
closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based
reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

### [11] [Kernel Regression of Multi-Way Data via Tensor Trains with Hadamard Overparametrization: The Dynamic Graph Flow Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22197)
*Duc Thien Nguyen,Konstantinos Slavakis,Eleftherios Kofidis,Dimitris Pados*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出KReTTaH框架，通过张量分解和Hadamard过参数化实现高效的多维数据插补，在动态图流估计中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多维数据插补问题，特别是动态图流中的缺失值估计，需要既能保持参数效率又能融入图结构先验的方法

Result: 在真实图数据集上的测试表明，KReTTaH在缺失时变边流插补方面持续优于现有最先进方法，包括非参数张量方法和神经网络方法

Conclusion: KReTTaH提供了一个可解释且灵活的多维数据插补框架，能够有效整合图结构先验，在动态图流估计中具有优越性能

Abstract: A regression-based framework for interpretable multi-way data imputation,
termed Kernel Regression via Tensor Trains with Hadamard overparametrization
(KReTTaH), is introduced. KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting
imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter
efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which
reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via
Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter
space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on
the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative
application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this
setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based
(topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on
real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives-including a nonparametric tensor- and a
neural-network-based methods-for imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.

Conclusion: NUFILT通过零空间过滤和适配器的联合优化，成功实现了数据自由条件下的模型融合，在保持现有知识的同时有效吸收新知识，且无需额外参数或推理成本。

Abstract: Data-free continual model merging (DFCMM) aims to fuse independently
fine-tuned models into a single backbone that evolves with incoming tasks
without accessing task data. This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata
for DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and
fidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that
existing approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with
parameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence
of task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a
data-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our
key observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation
subspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and
fidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior
responses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby
ensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects
complementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new
tasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain
consistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This
joint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge
while retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a
layer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost.
Theoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that
justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT achieves state-of-the-art
performance with minimal forgetting on both vision and NLP benchmarks,
improving average accuracy by 4-7% over OPCM and WUDI-Merging, while narrowing
the gap to fine-tuning and reducing computation overhead.

Conclusion: 强调泄漏感知评估协议的重要性，为数据集划分、模型选择和验证提供实用指南，促进工业故障诊断中更可信的机器学习系统开发。

Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety
and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in
machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong
performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to
real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage.
This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing
fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common
dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise
splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To
address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology
centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the
physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate
the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of
co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as
Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset
diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training
bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our
methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU),
and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance
of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for
dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the
development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis
applications.

TL;DR: SeismoGPT是一个基于Transformer的模型，用于预测未来引力波探测器中的三分量地震波形，支持单站和阵列输入，能够准确进行短期地震预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为支持未来引力波探测器（如爱因斯坦望远镜）中的牛顿噪声抑制和实时观测控制，需要开发数据驱动的地震预测方法。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的自回归模型，直接从波形数据中学习时间和空间依赖性，支持单站和阵列输入。

Result: 模型在即时预测窗口内表现良好，随着预测时间延长性能逐渐下降，符合自回归系统的预期行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的地震预测奠定了基础，有望支持引力波探测器的噪声抑制和观测控制。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting
three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave
detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an
autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based
inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform
data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate
short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the
immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected
in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven
seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time
observatory control.

Abstract: An associative memory (AM) enables cue-response recall, and associative
memorization has recently been noted to underlie the operation of modern neural
architectures such as Transformers. This work addresses a distributed setting
where agents maintain a local AM to recall their own associations as well as
selective information from others. Specifically, we introduce a distributed
online gradient descent method that optimizes local AMs at different agents
through communication over routing trees. Our theoretical analysis establishes
sublinear regret guarantees, and experiments demonstrate that the proposed

Abstract: Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource
tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by
pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained
via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model
becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In
this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to
induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a
minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision
trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning
from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional
CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not
outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable
reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the
reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input:
correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not
captured in the data.

TL;DR: ECHO是一个新的解码器中心的大型EEG模型范式，将EEG建模重新定义为序列到序列学习，通过捕捉信号、标签和任务之间的层次关系，并整合离散支持样本来构建上下文线索，实现无需参数更新的动态任务适应。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的大型EEG模型主要关注编码器架构，缺乏同等能力的解码器，限制了学习特征的充分利用。需要一种能够更好地利用学习特征并适应多种任务的模型架构。

Method: 提出ECHO解码器中心范式，将EEG建模重构为序列到序列学习，捕捉信号、标签和任务之间的层次关系，整合离散支持样本构建上下文线索，实现上下文学习能力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，即使使用基本模型组件，ECHO在多任务设置中始终优于最先进的单任务LEM，展现出卓越的泛化能力和适应性。

Conclusion: ECHO通过解码器中心的序列到序列学习范式，成功解决了现有EEG模型解码能力不足的问题，实现了无需参数更新的动态任务适应，在多任务场景下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications,
necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and
datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric
architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal
representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable
capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address
this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that
reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures
layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space,
while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues. This
design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to
heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that, even with basic model components, ECHO
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task
settings, showing superior generalization and adaptability.

Motivation: 传统幂等生成网络需要对抗训练且容易不稳定，而扩散模型虽然稳定但计算成本高。本文旨在结合两者的优势，开发稳定且高效的生成模型。

Method: 从预训练扩散模型的分数中蒸馏幂等模型，无需对抗损失，支持单步和多步采样，可直接在源域操作并实现零样本编辑。

Result: 在CIFAR和CelebA数据集上实现了幂等模型的最先进结果，推理速度比迭代分数模型更快，支持质量与效率的权衡。

Conclusion: SIGN成功地将扩散模型与幂等网络结合，提供了稳定、高效且灵活的生成建模方法，支持多步采样和零样本编辑功能。

Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models
based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and
multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational
cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training
instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular
approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one
distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models
have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity
generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of
high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along
the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and
consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even
perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite
diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores,
called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require
adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed
score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively
distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than
iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing
users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the
source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto
the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our
models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for
idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.

Motivation: 重新定义幻觉为损失最小化与人类可接受输出之间的结构性错配，挑战传统认为幻觉仅源于模型不完美的观点。

Method: 通过理论分析建立幻觉的数学定义，推导出通用数据分布下幻觉率的高概率下界，并在硬币聚合、开放问答和文生图任务上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明即使最优估计器也会产生幻觉，支持了理论分析中关于幻觉是结构性问题的结论。

Conclusion: 幻觉是损失最小化与人类期望之间固有的结构性错配问题，而非简单的模型缺陷，需要重新思考生成模型的评估和优化方法。

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an
estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even
loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a
general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data
distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between
loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors
induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and
text-to-image support our theory.

Conclusion: d2框架成功提升了扩散语言模型的推理能力，证明了掩码扩散模型在复杂推理任务中的潜力

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) have achieved competitive performance
in text generation, improving their reasoning ability with reinforcement
learning remains an active research area. Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning
framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy
gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate
the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation
for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are
particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation.
We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key
for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves
over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on
supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs
on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks
(GSM8K and MATH500).

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields,
from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth
science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready
benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we
first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark
derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.
Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction
paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of
missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its
ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of
observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical
state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that
efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with
geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of
computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the
challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the
KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme
data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust
model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research
under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at:

Conclusion: 共形数据增强是一种有效的原则性数据过滤方法，能够可靠地控制风险并显著提升模型性能

Abstract: With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications,
synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the
demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in
expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while
introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical:
effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same
underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this
paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering
framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse
synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk
control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal
model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic
prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection,
showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over
unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.

Conclusion: FedZero算法提供了强大的理论保证，其开发的浓度工具不仅对高概率保证至关重要，也具有独立的研究价值。

Abstract: We study distributed learning in the setting of gradient-free zero-order
optimization and introduce FedZero, a federated zero-order algorithm that
delivers sharp theoretical guarantees. Specifically, FedZero: (1) achieves
near-optimal optimization error bounds with high probability in the federated
convex setting; and (2) in the single-worker regime-where the problem reduces
to the standard zero-order framework, establishes the first high-probability
convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization, thereby
strengthening the classical expectation-based results. At its core, FedZero
employs a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere.
To analyze it, we develop new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz
functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere, with explicit
constants. These concentration tools are not only central to our
high-probability guarantees but may also be of independent interest.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface
reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture
(TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed
parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs).
Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high
accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing
calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support
problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural
operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional
functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility
of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed
modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained
neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These
include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator,
tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev
norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and
reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical
processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by
computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by
computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic
modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of
calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional
methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex
reservoir systems.

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such
fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their
application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation
models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and
were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However,
these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their
ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose
GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we
design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure
generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and
a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal
models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to
efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment
the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood
aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior,
allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in
tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes,
GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves
state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and
task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our
work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed
prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation
models.

Conclusion: 这是首个无需训练、基于激活指导的扩散模型结构压缩方法，提供了理论清晰性和实际效率，为扩散模型的高效部署提供了新途径。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are
computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative
denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization,
timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime
but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to
recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated
activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both
attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely
gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation
task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank
subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This
activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by
applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key
interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than
isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across
modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff
achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over
baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any
backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration
samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is
the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is
entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical
efficiency.

Result: 实验证明基于评分标准的奖励显著缓解了奖励过度优化问题，并实现了有效的LLM后训练改进。

Conclusion: 基于评分标准的奖励机制是解决奖励过度优化问题的有效方法，能够利用离策略样本同时保持奖励的准确性。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward
over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve
high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the
inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.
This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail
examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from
stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them
yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this,
we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy
examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that
capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing
among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this
idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially
mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training
improvements. Our code can be accessed at

Abstract: Learning representations that transfer well to diverse downstream tasks
remains a central challenge in representation learning. Existing paradigms --
contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders --
balance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive
Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the
Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM
maximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering
of codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by
imposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative
fidelity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose cMIM, a
contrastive extension of MIM that removes the need for positive data
augmentation and is substantially less sensitive to batch size than InfoNCE.
Second, we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for
extracting enriched features from encoder-decoder models that boosts
discriminative performance without additional training and applies broadly
beyond MIM. Third, we provide empirical evidence across vision and molecular
benchmarks showing that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and
regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. These
results position cMIM as a unified framework for representation learning,
advancing the goal of models that serve both discriminative and generative
applications effectively.

Method: 使用阻尼波动方程和随机Kac表示，引入速度空间的分类器自由引导，并提出端点蒸馏方法，训练学生模型在长区间内匹配冻结的教师模型。

Result: 实验表明DistillKac能够以极少的函数评估次数生成高质量样本，同时保持有限速度概率流的数值稳定性优势。

Conclusion: DistillKac通过有限速度概率流和蒸馏技术，实现了高效稳定的图像生成，在保持质量的同时显著减少了计算开销。

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave
equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at
finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can
become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics
enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy.
Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity
space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then
propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen
teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes
supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments
demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function
evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed
probability flows.

Motivation: 当前知识追踪模型研究主要关注提高预测准确性，但这些模型在学生选择干扰项时最容易出错，导致学生错误未被检测到。

Method: 通过捕捉知识追踪模型的预测不确定性，并证明预测不确定性与模型错误预测之间存在关联。

Abstract: The main focus of research on Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is on model
developments with the aim of improving predictive accuracy. Most of these
models make the most incorrect predictions when students choose a distractor,
leading to student errors going undetected. We present an approach to add new
capabilities to KT models by capturing predictive uncertainty and demonstrate
that a larger predictive uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions.
We show that uncertainty in KT models is informative and that this signal would
be pedagogically useful for application in an educational learning platform
that can be used in a limited resource setting where understanding student
ability is necessary.

### [31] [$\mathbf{Li_2}$: A Framework on Dynamics of Feature Emergence and Delayed Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21519)
*Yuandong Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Li₂的数学框架，用于分析两层非线性网络中的grokking现象，揭示了三个关键阶段：惰性学习、独立特征学习和交互特征学习，通过梯度结构来表征特征涌现过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然grokking现象已被广泛研究，但仍缺乏数学框架来系统描述复杂结构化输入中特征如何涌现、何时涌现以及训练条件的影响。

Method: 提出Li₂框架，通过分析反向传播梯度GF的结构变化来识别三个学习阶段，研究能量函数E的局部最优值如何诱导可泛化特征，并在群算术任务中验证。

Result: 揭示了权重衰减、学习率和样本大小等超参数在grokking中的作用，证明了记忆和泛化的可扩展规律，并从梯度动力学角度解释了Muon等优化器的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解grokking现象提供了数学基础，阐明了特征涌现的机制，并可扩展到多层架构分析。

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been
studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a
mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in
which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We
propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key
stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy
learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature
learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$
across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden
representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only
depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their
representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about
target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics
follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local
maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima
induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they
change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we
provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on
missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles
played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample
sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and
generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as
Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our
analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

TL;DR: TRiCo是一个新颖的三元博弈论协同训练框架，通过将教师、两个学生和一个对抗生成器整合到统一训练范式中，重新思考半监督学习的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有半监督学习框架的关键限制，如静态视图交互、不可靠的伪标签以及缺乏困难样本建模。

Method: 将SSL构建为三个角色之间的结构化交互：两个在冻结互补表示上训练的学生分类器、通过验证反馈自适应调节伪标签选择和损失平衡的无学习教师，以及扰动嵌入以发现决策边界弱点的非参数生成器。伪标签基于互信息而非置信度选择。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、SVHN、STL-10和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，TRiCo在低标签机制下始终达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRiCo提供了一个原则性和可推广的解决方案，同时保持架构无关性并与冻结视觉主干兼容。

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that
rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher,
two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm.
Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL
as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers
trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher
that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via
validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs
embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected
based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust
measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a
Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students
follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in
existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable
pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled
and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10,
and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and
compatible with frozen vision backbones.

*Sathwik Karnik,Somil Bansal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRT-Align是一个基于可达性分析的LLM安全对齐框架，在推理时通过可达性分析预测不安全生成，并提供运行时监控和最小干预的转向机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的安全方法RLHF在训练阶段有效，但在推理时无法防止不安全内容的生成，需要一种推理时的安全保障机制。

Method: 将自回归生成建模为潜在空间中的动态系统，通过后向可达性学习安全价值函数，实现运行时监控和最小限制的转向过滤。

Result: 在多个LLM和毒性基准测试中，BRT-Align比基线方法更准确、更早地检测不安全延续，显著减少不安全生成，同时保持句子多样性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 可达性分析为推理时LLM安全提供了原则性和实用的基础，能够持续产生更少暴力、粗俗、冒犯和政治偏见的内容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising
urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The
dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
-- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards
at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose
BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety
tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a
dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward
reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables
two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe
completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering
filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from
unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks
demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of
unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment,
BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence
diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent
alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less
violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together,
these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and
practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了专业领域中LLM数据增强潜力与安全需求之间的矛盾，为高风险领域的安全数据增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used strategy to improve model robustness and
generalization by enriching training datasets with synthetic examples. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities
for this purpose, their applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare
present unique challenges due to the risk of generating clinically incorrect or
misleading information. In this work, we propose a novel query-based model
collaboration framework that integrates expert-level domain knowledge to guide
the augmentation process to preserve critical medical information. Experiments
on clinical prediction tasks demonstrate that our lightweight
collaboration-based approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation
methods while improving safety through reduced factual errors. This framework
addresses the gap between LLM augmentation potential and the safety
requirements of specialized domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习和自然学习都是选择过程，基于经验估计进行选择时会受到数据随机性的影响，导致在不确定性下进行选择。需要统计工具来提供理论保证。

Method: 使用集中不等式（如Hoeffding、Bernstein等）控制经验估计与真实期望的偏差；在离线学习中应用Occam剃刀、VC分析和PAC-Bayesian分析；在在线学习中分析不同环境下的遗憾界限。

Result: 开发了一套完整的统计工具集，能够为离线监督学习和在线学习提供理论保证，包括泛化界限和遗憾界限的推导方法。

Conclusion: 本书系统性地提供了处理机器学习中不确定性选择问题的统计工具，涵盖了从集中不等式到离线学习和在线学习的完整理论框架。

Abstract: Learning, whether natural or artificial, is a process of selection. It starts
with a set of candidate options and selects the more successful ones. In the
case of machine learning the selection is done based on empirical estimates of
prediction accuracy of candidate prediction rules on some data. Due to
randomness of data sampling the empirical estimates are inherently noisy,
leading to selection under uncertainty. The book provides statistical tools to
obtain theoretical guarantees on the outcome of selection under uncertainty. We
start with concentration of measure inequalities, which are the main
statistical instrument for controlling how much an empirical estimate of
expectation of a function deviates from the true expectation. The book covers a
broad range of inequalities, including Markov's, Chebyshev's, Hoeffding's,
Bernstein's, Empirical Bernstein's, Unexpected Bernstein's, kl, and split-kl.
We then study the classical (offline) supervised learning and provide a range
of tools for deriving generalization bounds, including Occam's razor,
Vapnik-Chervonenkis analysis, and PAC-Bayesian analysis. The latter is further
applied to derive generalization guarantees for weighted majority votes. After
covering the offline setting, we turn our attention to online learning. We
present the space of online learning problems characterized by environmental
feedback, environmental resistance, and structural complexity. A common
performance measure in online learning is regret, which compares performance of
an algorithm to performance of the best prediction rule in hindsight, out of a
restricted set of prediction rules. We present tools for deriving regret bounds
in stochastic and adversarial environments, and under full information and
bandit feedback.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了LLMs中的归纳头机制如何支持上下文学习，特别是对于具有层次结构的复杂重复模式。研究发现LLMs具有自适应的归纳头，能够学习在上下文中关注什么内容，并且这种学习由揭示潜在上下文的注意力头支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知归纳头在Transformer语言模型的上下文学习中起关键作用，但尚不清楚这种机制是否能支持具有层次结构的复杂重复模式的上下文学习。自然语言中存在大量这种情况，需要整合更多上下文线索来预测正确的标记。

Method: 设计了一个合成的上下文学习任务，其中标记以层次依赖关系重复出现。评估了一系列LLMs在这些标记序列和自然语言类似情况上的表现，并研究了归纳头本身如何在上下文中学习。

Result: 发现了支持预测的自适应归纳头，这些归纳头能够学习在上下文中关注什么内容。学习由揭示一组潜在上下文的注意力头支持，这些上下文决定了不同的标记转换关系。

Conclusion: 不仅证明了LLMs具有能够学习的归纳头，还提供了关于LLMs如何在上下文中学习预测高阶重复模式的完整机制解释。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, the ability to use
information provided as context to improve prediction of future tokens.
Induction heads have been argued to play a crucial role for in-context learning
in Transformer Language Models. These attention heads make a token attend to
successors of past occurrences of the same token in the input. This basic
mechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns.
However, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning
of more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural
language is teeming with such cases: The article "the" in English usually
prefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a
particular instance of "the", we need to integrate further contextual cues from
the text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all
past instances of successor tokens of "the" in a context-independent manner,
they cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this
study, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are
repeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all
successor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens.
Evaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language
analogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning
what to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads
themselves learn in-context. We find evidence that learning is supported by
attention heads that uncover a set of latent contexts, determining the
different token transition relationships. Overall, we not only show that LLMs
have induction heads that learn, but offer a complete mechanistic account of
how LLMs learn to predict higher-order repetitive patterns in-context.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Gumbel动力学模型(GDM)，通过引入离散状态的连续松弛和Gumbel分布的噪声模型，解决了传统切换动力系统在建模平滑过渡和随机混合状态时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统切换动力系统虽然能建模复杂时间序列并保持可解释性，但由于离散状态特性，难以捕捉平滑、变速的过渡以及随机混合的重叠状态，在真实数据集上经常出现虚假的快速切换。

Method: 引入离散状态的连续松弛，在松弛离散状态空间上通过Gumbel分布定义不同的噪声模型，扩展可用状态动力学集合，使模型能够更准确地近似平滑和非平稳的真实动力学。

Result: 在标准仿真数据集上验证了方法的有效性，展示了在随机设置中建模软粘状态和过渡的能力；在两个真实世界数据集上应用，证明了在具有多种动力学的随机时间序列中推断可解释状态的能力。

Conclusion: GDM通过连续松弛和Gumbel噪声模型，成功解决了传统切换动力系统的局限性，能够更准确地建模平滑过渡和随机混合状态，同时保持完全可微性以实现快速可扩展训练。

Abstract: Switching dynamical systems can model complicated time series data while
maintaining interpretability by inferring a finite set of dynamics primitives
and explaining different portions of the observed time series with one of these
primitives. However, due to the discrete nature of this set, such models
struggle to capture smooth, variable-speed transitions, as well as stochastic
mixtures of overlapping states, and the inferred dynamics often display
spurious rapid switching on real-world datasets. Here, we propose the Gumbel
Dynamical Model (GDM). First, by introducing a continuous relaxation of
discrete states and a different noise model defined on the relaxed-discrete
state space via the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the set of available state
dynamics, allowing the model to approximate smoother and non-stationary
ground-truth dynamics more faithfully. Second, the relaxation makes the model
fully differentiable, enabling fast and scalable training with standard
gradient descent methods. We validate our approach on standard simulation
datasets and highlight its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions
in a stochastic setting. Furthermore, we apply our model to two real-world
datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer interpretable states in stochastic
time series with multiple dynamics, a setting where traditional methods often
fail.

Motivation: LLM的自我意识和感知能力日益受到公众关注，具有重要的安全和政策意义，但目前测量这些能力的科学方法仍处于起步阶段。

Method: 受非人类动物元认知研究启发，该方法避免模型自我报告，而是测试模型在多大程度上能够战略性地部署内部状态知识，使用两种实验范式分析模型行为表现和token概率。

Result: 前沿LLM显示出特定的元认知能力，这些能力具有有限分辨率、情境依赖性，且与人类元认知存在质的不同。不同能力相近的模型之间存在有趣差异，表明后期训练可能在发展元认知能力中发挥作用。

Conclusion: 研究为量化评估LLM元认知能力提供了新方法，揭示了前沿模型具备一定元认知能力，但这些能力与人类存在本质差异，为理解LLM认知机制提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The possibility of LLM self-awareness and even sentience is gaining
increasing public attention and has major safety and policy implications, but
the science of measuring them is still in a nascent state. Here we introduce a
novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in
LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals,
our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models
can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental
paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show
increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically
the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to
answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate
what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We
buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities
returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal
signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that
these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent
manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We
also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities,
suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive
abilities.

Conclusion: GenUQ为算子学习提供了一种有效的不确定性量化框架，特别适用于难以构建似然函数的随机算子问题。

Abstract: Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to
mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive
numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between
functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling.
Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as
modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches
towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have
relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy
data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood
is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a
measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by
introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter
distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ
outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a
manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic
PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.

Result: 在高斯混合模型、粒子系统和大规模蛋白质-配体共折叠问题中，DriftLite相比纯引导和顺序蒙特卡洛基线，持续减少方差并提高样本质量。

Conclusion: DriftLite为扩散模型的推理时适应提供了一条原则性、高效的路径。

Abstract: We study inference-time scaling for diffusion models, where the goal is to
adapt a pre-trained model to new target distributions without retraining.
Existing guidance-based methods are simple but introduce bias, while
particle-based corrections suffer from weight degeneracy and high computational
cost. We introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based
approach that steers the inference dynamics on the fly with provably optimal
stability control. DriftLite exploits a previously unexplored degree of freedom
in the Fokker-Planck equation between the drift and particle potential, and
yields two practical instantiations: Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance
(VCG/ECG) for approximating the optimal drift with minimal overhead. Across
Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand
co-folding problems, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves
sample quality over pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines. These
results highlight a principled, efficient route toward scalable inference-time
adaptation of diffusion models.

Conclusion: 尽管一般离散模型从纯观测数据中不可识别，但可以刻画兼容参数和结构的完整集合，提出的框架在温和假设下实现了马尔可夫等价类的可识别性。

Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data
typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation
models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating
process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore,
current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in
discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable
structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary
dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete
models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to
characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures.
Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild
assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable
optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic
simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that
our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

Abstract: In this digital era, online shopping is common practice in our daily lives.
Product reviews significantly influence consumer buying behavior and help

reviews accurately so that it enhances the authenticity of the review. Using a
scalable big data framework, we efficiently process and analyze a large scale

study illustrates the utility of various machine learning classifiers in
detecting spam reviews, with Logistic Regression achieving an accuracy of
90.35%, thus contributing to a more trustworthy and transparent online shopping
environment.

Abstract: Treatment effect estimation is essential for informed decision-making in many
fields such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. While flexible machine
learning models have been widely applied for estimating heterogeneous treatment
effects, quantifying the inherent uncertainty of their point predictions
remains an issue. Recent advancements in conformal prediction address this
limitation by allowing for inexpensive computation, as well as distribution
shifts, while still providing frequentist, finite-sample coverage guarantees
under minimal assumptions for any point-predictor model. This advancement holds
significant potential for improving decision-making in especially high-stakes
environments. In this work, we perform a systematic review regarding conformal
prediction methods for treatment effect estimation and provide for both the
necessary theoretical background. Through a systematic filtering process, we
select and analyze eleven key papers, identifying and describing current
state-of-the-art methods in this area. Based on our findings, we propose
directions for future research.

Abstract: Uniform bounds on sketched inner products of vectors or matrices underpin
several important computational and statistical results in machine learning and
randomized algorithms, including the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma, the
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching, and approximate
linear algebra. However, many modern analyses involve *sketched bilinear
forms*, for which existing uniform bounds either do not apply or are not sharp
on general sets. In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such
sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric
complexities of the associated sets. Our approach relies on generic chaining
and introduces new techniques for handling suprema over pairs of sets. We
further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a
sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as
$\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma
as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain
improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where
such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and
design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that
depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather
than the ambient dimension.

Conclusion: FedProTIP通过梯度投影和任务身份预测有效缓解了联邦持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，为分布式流数据学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables distributed client devices to
learn from streaming data across diverse and evolving tasks. A major challenge
to continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, is exacerbated in decentralized
settings by the data heterogeneity, constrained communication and privacy
concerns. We propose Federated gradient Projection-based Continual Learning
with Task Identity Prediction (FedProTIP), a novel FCL framework that mitigates
forgetting by projecting client updates onto the orthogonal complement of the
subspace spanned by previously learned representations of the global model.
This projection reduces interference with earlier tasks and preserves
performance across the task sequence. To further address the challenge of
task-agnostic inference, we incorporate a lightweight mechanism that leverages
core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and dynamically adjust the
global model's outputs. Extensive experiments across standard FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in average accuracy, particularly in settings where task identities are a
priori unknown.

Abstract: We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using
Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight
matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to
describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types
of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a
kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of
realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for
Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.

Abstract: The study of causal abstractions bridges two integral components of human
intelligence: the ability to determine cause and effect, and the ability to
interpret complex patterns into abstract concepts. Formally, causal abstraction
frameworks define connections between complicated low-level causal models and
simple high-level ones. One major limitation of most existing definitions is
that they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in
which multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping
to the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract
invariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions
called projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to
accommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected
abstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent
observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to
high-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove
a new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal
queries from limited low-level data. Finally, we experimentally show the
effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散数据引导方法主要依赖一阶泰勒近似，但在离散状态空间中近似误差可能很大，需要更精确的引导框架。

Method: 基于学习的离散流匹配模型，推导期望分布的精确转移率，实现单次前向传播的采样步骤，可无缝应用于掩码扩散模型。

Result: 在能量引导模拟、文本到图像生成的偏好对齐以及多模态理解任务中展示了有效性。

Conclusion: 该统一框架足够通用，包含现有引导方法作为特例，显著提高了离散数据引导的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by
steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling
discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the
first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However,
such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the
approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete
data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate
for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model,
leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling
step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is
general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it
can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and
preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding
tasks. The code is available through

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备端学习需要高效学习，但反向传播中激活存储的高内存成本限制了现有方法的应用。现有激活压缩方法依赖重复低秩分解，带来计算开销且未探索持续学习场景。

Method: 提出LANCE框架，执行一次性高阶SVD获得可重用的低秩子空间进行激活投影，消除重复分解。固定低秩子空间通过为任务分配正交子空间实现设备端持续学习。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100等数据集上减少激活存储达250倍，保持与完整反向传播相当的准确率。在持续学习基准测试中，以一小部分内存成本实现与正交梯度投影方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: LANCE为边缘设备上的高效微调和持续学习提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term
adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires
efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring
new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by
high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing
activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated
low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods
have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank
Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order
Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for
activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both
memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable
on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces
without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE
reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy
comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets,
Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split
CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive
with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost.
These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient
fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

Motivation: 目标是开发一种能够保持点云中局部非凸性的降维方法，特别关注由绕路路径引起的非凸结构。

Method: 构建k-NN图，识别欧几里得距离与最短路径比率低于阈值的可接受对，聚合它们的归一化方向形成半正定非凸性结构矩阵，使用该矩阵的前k个特征向量进行投影。

Result: 提供了两种可验证保证：成对后验证书（限制每个可接受对的投影后失真）和平均情况谱边界（将捕获方向能量与结构矩阵谱联系起来）。

Conclusion: CDP提供了一种可验证的降维方法，能够有效保持局部非凸性，并通过评估协议使实践者能够在自己的数据上检查保证。

Abstract: We propose Convexity-Driven Projection (CDP), a boundary-free linear method
for dimensionality reduction of point clouds that targets preserving
detour-induced local non-convexity. CDP builds a $k$-NN graph, identifies
admissible pairs whose Euclidean-to-shortest-path ratios are below a threshold,
and aggregates their normalized directions to form a positive semidefinite
non-convexity structure matrix. The projection uses the top-$k$ eigenvectors of
the structure matrix. We give two verifiable guarantees. A pairwise
a-posteriori certificate that bounds the post-projection distortion for each
admissible pair, and an average-case spectral bound that links expected
captured direction energy to the spectrum of the structure matrix, yielding
quantile statements for typical distortion. Our evaluation protocol reports
fixed- and reselected-pairs detour errors and certificate quantiles, enabling
practitioners to check guarantees on their data.

TL;DR: 提出一种动态切换训练策略的方法，在ViT-Large模型训练中从全参数训练切换到低秩适应(LoRA)，显著减少可训练参数和训练时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型训练资源消耗巨大，且大部分学习发生在训练早期阶段，后期权重变化趋于稳定，可用低秩矩阵捕捉

Method: 通过用户定义超参数确定切换点，根据各模块层的收敛程度分配特定秩，动态从全参数训练切换到LoRA

Result: 将可训练参数减少到原来的10%，吞吐量提升3倍，每轮平均训练时间减少1.5倍，GPU内存消耗降低20%，同时保持模型精度

Conclusion: 该方法能有效降低大型模型训练的资源需求，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率

Abstract: Training large models ranging from millions to billions of parameters is
highly resource-intensive, requiring significant time, compute, and memory. It
is observed that most of the learning (higher change in weights) takes place in
the earlier stage of the training loop. These changes stabilize as training
continues, enabling them to be captured by matrices of a low intrinsic rank.
Therefore, we propose an approach to identify such states of partial
convergence and dynamically switch from full parameter training to Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on the ViT-Large model. We introduce a flexible approach that
leverages user-defined hyperparameters to determine the switching point and
assign a rank specific to each module layer based on its level of convergence.
Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while
reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size,
resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average
training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%

Motivation: 分子Hessian矩阵在计算化学中至关重要，但计算成本高昂且随系统规模扩展性差，无论是量子力学方法还是神经网络都存在这一问题。

Method: 利用图神经网络消息传递过程中计算得到的不可约表示特征（最高到l=2度）构建SE(3)-等变、对称的Hessian矩阵，实现直接预测。

Result: HIP Hessians比传统方法快1-2个数量级，更准确、内存效率更高、更容易训练，且在系统规模扩展方面更具优势。

Conclusion: HIP方法在多种下游任务中验证了其优越性能，包括过渡态搜索、几何优化、零点能校正和振动分析，为Hessian矩阵的直接预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to
vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second
derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally
expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum
mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that
Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying
on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can
construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible
representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message
passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of
magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and
enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions
across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior
performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization,
zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We
open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of
the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip

Motivation: 解耦表示旨在恢复观测数据背后的潜在变异因子，但其可识别性尚未完全理解。现有方法依赖统计假设，需要更稳健的识别条件。

Method: 引入机制独立性框架，提出从支持基、稀疏性到高阶条件的多种独立准则，通过图论将潜在子空间表征为连通分量。

Result: 证明每个独立准则都能在非线性、不可逆混合下实现潜在子空间的识别，建立了这些准则之间的层次关系。

Conclusion: 该框架阐明了在不依赖统计假设的情况下解耦表示可识别的条件，为解耦学习提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Disentangled representations seek to recover latent factors of variation
underlying observed data, yet their identifiability is still not fully
understood. We introduce a unified framework in which disentanglement is
achieved through mechanistic independence, which characterizes latent factors
by how they act on observed variables rather than by their latent distribution.
This perspective is invariant to changes of the latent density, even when such
changes induce statistical dependencies among factors. Within this framework,
we propose several related independence criteria -- ranging from support-based
and sparsity-based to higher-order conditions -- and show that each yields
identifiability of latent subspaces, even under nonlinear, non-invertible
mixing. We further establish a hierarchy among these criteria and provide a
graph-theoretic characterization of latent subspaces as connected components.
Together, these results clarify the conditions under which disentangled
representations can be identified without relying on statistical assumptions.

Motivation: 解决传统LoRA受名义秩限制的问题，以及HiRA等方法中全局调制导致的局限性，旨在实现更高效的参数微调。

Method: 将权重矩阵分区，在每个块内独立应用HiRA式乘法调制，保持参数效率的同时实现局部秩放大。

Result: 在8个常识推理任务和2个算术基准测试中，使用Llama-3.2 1B/3B、Mistral-7B和Gemma-2 9B模型，BHRA在相同参数预算下持续超越强PEFT基线。

Conclusion: 块状设计能维持丰富的频谱，缓解全局调制引起的崩溃，BHRA是高效的参数微调方法。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods must be resource-efficient yet
handle heterogeneous reasoning transformations, and classical low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) is constrained by the nominal rank $r$. Hadamard-style
extensions like HiRA raise the nominal rank but couple every update to the
global energy pattern of the frozen weight matrix, while ABBA trades this
inductive bias for fully learned dense intermediates. To address the limitation
of global modulation, we propose Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA),
which partitions each weight matrix and applies HiRA-style multiplicative
modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter
footprint while unlocking localized rank amplification. Our empirical analyses
reveal that this blockwise design maintains rich spectra across rank budgets,
mitigating the collapse induced by global modulation. Across eight commonsense
reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks with Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma-2 9B, BHRA consistently surpasses strong PEFT baselines under matched
parameter budgets.

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various
applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency.
However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training,
particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence
analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the
impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of
activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to
the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique
solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is
essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the
global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized
regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which
not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling
Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in
real-world applications.

Abstract: Mask-based pretraining has become a cornerstone of modern large-scale models
across language, vision, and recently biology. Despite its empirical success,
its role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this
work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly
characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm ("ridge-less")
linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further
analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based
pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated
across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers)
applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an
embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random
Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features
from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our
linear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA
sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard

Abstract: We provide a theoretical analysis for end-to-end training Discrete Flow
Matching (DFM) generative models. DFM is a promising discrete generative
modeling framework that learns the underlying generative dynamics by training a
neural network to approximate the transformative velocity field. Our analysis
establishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution
estimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the
generated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned
velocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources:
(i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer
architecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where
we derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a
finite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof
that the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to
the true data distribution as the training set size increases.

fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the
property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the
system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or
exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal
definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI
system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are
easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we
consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is
possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical
interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification,
planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's
incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting
problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's
results.

Conclusion: RED-DiffEq框架能够有效解决PDE控制的反问题，具有高精度、鲁棒性和良好泛化能力，可应用于多种PDE控制的反问题。

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-governed inverse problems are fundamental
across various scientific and engineering applications; yet they face
significant challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to
noise. Here, we introduce a new computational framework, RED-DiffEq, by
integrating physics-driven inversion and data-driven learning. RED-DiffEq
leverages pretrained diffusion models as a regularization mechanism for
PDE-governed inverse problems. We apply RED-DiffEq to solve the full waveform
inversion problem in geophysics, a challenging seismic imaging technique that
seeks to reconstruct high-resolution subsurface velocity models from seismic
measurement data. Our method shows enhanced accuracy and robustness compared to
conventional methods. Additionally, it exhibits strong generalization ability
to more complex velocity models that the diffusion model is not trained on. Our
framework can also be directly applied to diverse PDE-governed inverse
problems.

TL;DR: MMPlanner是一个零样本多模态程序规划框架，通过对象状态推理思维链提示显式建模对象状态转换，在文本规划、跨模态对齐和视觉步骤排序方面实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要利用大语言模型优化文本步骤，但视觉对象状态对齐和系统评估研究不足，需要解决跨模态对象状态一致性问题

Method: 提出Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought (OSR-CoT)提示方法，显式建模对象状态转换；设计LLM-as-a-judge评估协议和视觉步骤重排序任务

Conclusion: MMPlanner通过显式对象状态推理和系统评估方法，在多模态程序规划任务中取得了显著改进

Abstract: Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) aims to generate step-by-step
instructions that combine text and images, with the central challenge of
preserving object-state consistency across modalities while producing
informative plans. Existing approaches often leverage large language models
(LLMs) to refine textual steps; however, visual object-state alignment and
systematic evaluation are largely underexplored. We present MMPlanner, a
zero-shot MPP framework that introduces Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought
(OSR-CoT) prompting to explicitly model object-state transitions and generate
accurate multimodal plans. To assess plan quality, we design LLM-as-a-judge
protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, and further propose
a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Experiments on
RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN show that MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving textual planning by +6.8%, cross-modal alignment by
+11.9%, and visual step ordering by +26.7%

*Davide Bizzaro,Alessandro Daniele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Logic of Hypotheses (LoH)语言，统一神经符号集成中的规则注入和规则学习两种方法，通过选择操作符实现可学习的符号公式，支持任意程度的知识规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号集成领域存在两种主要方法：将手工规则注入神经网络模型，以及从数据中归纳符号规则。需要一种统一框架来灵活整合数据驱动的规则学习和符号先验知识。

Method: 扩展命题逻辑语法，引入具有可学习参数的选择操作符，可以从选项池中选择子公式。使用模糊逻辑将LoH公式编译为可微分计算图，通过反向传播学习最优选择。采用Goedel模糊逻辑和Goedel技巧实现无性能损失的离散化。

Result: 在表格数据和Visual Tic-Tac-Toe神经符号任务上取得强劲结果，同时生成可解释的决策规则。

Conclusion: LoH框架统一了神经符号集成的不同方法，支持灵活的知识规范，实现高性能和可解释性，并能无损离散化为布尔值函数。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic
reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules
into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce
Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands,
enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic
priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a
choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a
pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled
into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be
learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models,
while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification.
Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick
yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without
any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models,
showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task,
while producing interpretable decision rules.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的正则化方法DIM，通过在深度神经网络中强制执行领域知识驱动的单调性约束来防止过拟合，提高模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型由于复杂结构和大量参数容易过拟合，倾向于记忆训练数据中的噪声而非学习可泛化的模式。

Method: 通过惩罚相对于线性基线的单调性违规来强制执行单调性，建立线性参考、测量单调行为偏差，并将这些测量整合到训练目标中。

Result: 在芝加哥网约车数据集和合成数据集上的实验表明，即使适度的单调性约束也能持续提升各种神经网络架构的性能。

Conclusion: DIM通过应用领域知识驱动的单调性约束来正则化模型行为并减轻过拟合，从而提升了深度神经网络的预测性能。

Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due
to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to
memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that
generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new
regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep
Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships
in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically,
our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear
baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while
preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a
comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference,
measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements
into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology
using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically
created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show
that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model
performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by
applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior
and mitigate overfitting

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏针对颅内脑电图(iEEG)记录的标准化评估框架，无法有效比较不同建模方法。高分辨率神经数据集需要严谨的基准来区分竞争模型。

Method: 基于BrainTreebank数据集（10名受试者40小时的iEEG记录），构建Neuroprobe解码任务套件，通过测量各特征在时间和空间上的可解码性来研究多模态语言处理。

Result: 可视化显示了信息从颞上回流向前额叶皮层的过程，以及从简单听觉特征到复杂语言特征的进展。线性基线模型表现惊人，在许多任务上优于前沿基础模型。

Conclusion: Neuroprobe为神经基础模型提供了严谨的比较框架，促进iEEG领域快速发展，代码和公共排行榜已开放。

Abstract: High-resolution neural datasets enable foundation models for the next
generation of brain-computer interfaces and neurological treatments. The
community requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing
modeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for
intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe:
a suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the
brain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant
electrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal
signal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which
consists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a
naturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions.
First, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high
temporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine
when and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the
brain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all
electrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from
the superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from
simple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely
data-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models,
Neuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures
and training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly
strong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is
designed with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind. We make the
code for Neuroprobe openly available and maintain a public leaderboard, aiming
to enable rapid progress in the field of iEEG foundation models, at

TL;DR: SlotFM是一个可穿戴加速度计基础模型，通过时频槽注意力机制处理原始信号的时频表示，生成多个小嵌入来捕捉不同信号成分，在16个分类和回归下游任务中优于现有自监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型主要关注日常活动分类，限制了其在依赖其他信号特征的更广泛任务中的适用性，需要开发能泛化到多样化下游任务的加速度计基础模型。

Method: 使用时频槽注意力（Slot Attention的扩展）处理原始信号的时频表示，生成多个小嵌入捕捉不同信号成分，并引入两个损失正则化器来捕获局部结构和频率模式。

Result: 在16个分类和回归下游任务中，SlotFM在13个任务上优于现有自监督方法，在其余任务上达到可比结果，平均性能提升4.5%。

Conclusion: SlotFM展示了感知基础模型的强泛化能力，能够有效处理超出标准人类活动识别的多样化任务。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as
gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing
foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such
as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range
of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an
accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream
tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot
Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw
signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing
different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most
relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that
capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of
fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant
information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream
tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms
existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves
comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On
average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong
generalization for sensing foundation models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: K-means聚类是一个困难的离散优化问题，现有的松弛算法难以平衡约束可行性和目标最优性，在计算具有严格保证的二阶临界点时面临巨大挑战。

Method: 将K-means问题重新表述为子流形上的光滑无约束优化，利用黎曼几何结构，采用二阶立方正则化黎曼牛顿算法，通过流形分解使每个牛顿子问题能在线性时间内求解。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法比最先进的一阶非负低秩分解方法收敛速度快得多，同时达到相似的统计最优精度。

Conclusion: 通过黎曼优化框架，成功解决了K-means聚类中的二阶临界点计算问题，实现了快速收敛和最优统计性能的平衡。

Abstract: Clustering is a hard discrete optimization problem. Nonconvex approaches such
as low-rank semidefinite programming (SDP) have recently demonstrated promising
statistical and local algorithmic guarantees for cluster recovery. Due to the
combinatorial structure of the $K$-means clustering problem, current relaxation
algorithms struggle to balance their constraint feasibility and objective
optimality, presenting tremendous challenges in computing the second-order
critical points with rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we provide a new
formulation of the $K$-means problem as a smooth unconstrained optimization
over a submanifold and characterize its Riemannian structures to allow it to be
solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. By
factorizing the $K$-means manifold into a product manifold, we show how each
Newton subproblem can be solved in linear time. Our numerical experiments show
that the proposed method converges significantly faster than the
state-of-the-art first-order nonnegative low-rank factorization method, while
achieving similarly optimal statistical accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前馈神经网络的逻辑很大程度上体现在内部层神经元的激活状态中，通过分析这些状态可以提取出能够保证特定输出行为的网络属性。

Method: 基于神经元激活状态（数值或开关状态）提取规则作为前提条件，这些规则表示隐含层中捕获的网络属性，能够推导出期望的输出行为。

Result: 开发了Prophecy工具，展示了其在不同类型模型和输出属性上的应用，包括神经网络的形式化解释推断与证明、组合验证、运行时监控、修复等。

Conclusion: Prophecy在大规模视觉语言模型时代具有重要潜力，能够有效推断和验证神经网络的正式属性。

Abstract: We present Prophecy, a tool for automatically inferring formal properties of
feed-forward neural networks. Prophecy is based on the observation that a
significant part of the logic of feed-forward networks is captured in the
activation status of the neurons at inner layers. Prophecy works by extracting
rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off statuses) as preconditions
that imply certain desirable output property, e.g., the prediction being a
certain class. These rules represent network properties captured in the hidden
layers that imply the desired output behavior. We present the architecture of
the tool, highlight its features and demonstrate its usage on different types
of models and output properties. We present an overview of its applications,
such as inferring and proving formal explanations of neural networks,
compositional verification, run-time monitoring, repair, and others. We also
show novel results highlighting its potential in the era of large
vision-language models.

TL;DR: SpecMER是一种通过k-mer指导的推测解码框架，在蛋白质序列生成中结合生物结构功能先验，显著提高序列合理性同时保持解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在蛋白质工程中生成新序列，但顺序推理延迟高，限制高通量筛选应用。现有推测解码方法忽略蛋白质结构功能约束，导致生物不合理输出。

Method: 使用从多序列比对中提取的k-mer基序，结合生物结构功能先验，并行评分候选序列并选择最符合生物模式的序列。

Result: 相比标准自回归解码实现24-32%加速，同时获得更高接受率和改进的序列似然性。

Conclusion: SpecMER框架在保持推测解码效率的同时，显著提高了生成蛋白质序列的生物合理性。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have transformed protein engineering by enabling the
generation of novel protein sequences beyond those found in nature. However,
their sequential inference introduces significant latency, limiting their
utility in high-throughput protein screening. Speculative decoding accelerates
generation by employing a lightweight draft model to sample tokens, which a
larger target model then verifies and refines. Yet, in protein sequence
generation, draft models are typically agnostic to the structural and
functional constraints of the target protein, leading to biologically
implausible outputs and a shift in the likelihood distribution of generated
sequences. We introduce SpecMER (Speculative Decoding via k-mer Guidance), a
novel framework that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors
using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. By scoring
candidate sequences in parallel and selecting those most consistent with known
biological patterns, SpecMER significantly improves sequence plausibility while
retaining the efficiency of speculative decoding. SpecMER achieves 24-32%
speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance
rates and improved sequence likelihoods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了三种正交改进方法来提升仅使用PPG信号的心脏骤停预测系统：时间到事件建模、患者身份不变性特征学习、以及基于预训练辅助网络的伪标签回归。这些方法显著提高了24小时时间平均AUC，特别是在较长预测时间范围内表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于PPG的生理基础模型虽然能预测心脏骤停等关键事件，但其强大表示能力在数据/标签稀缺的下游任务中未能充分利用。需要改进PPG-only系统以更好地利用最小辅助信息。

Method: 1. 时间到事件建模（回归事件发生时间或精细离散生存建模）
2. 通过对抗训练使模型学习心脏骤停聚焦特征，实现患者身份不变性
3. 使用预训练辅助网络生成伪标签值进行回归，丰富心脏骤停波形标签

Result: 提出的方法将24小时时间平均AUC从0.74提升到0.78-0.80范围，主要在较长预测时间范围内有显著改进，事件临近时性能下降最小。

Conclusion: 通过多任务公式和PCGrad优化技术缓解竞争损失间的高梯度冲突，推动了早期预警系统研究，特别是在长时预测方面取得了重要进展。

Abstract: High-frequency physiological waveform modality offers deep, real-time
insights into patient status. Recently, physiological foundation models based
on Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict
critical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful
representation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the
downstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to
improve PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we
propose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the
event onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling.
Second, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them
patient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the
largest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the
p-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as
person identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we
propose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary
estimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as
lactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via
zero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform
labels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets. Our proposals can
independently improve the 24-hour time-averaged AUC from the 0.74 to the
0.78-0.80 range. We primarily improve over longer time horizons with minimal
degradation near the event, thus pushing the Early Warning System research.
Finally, we pursue multi-task formulation and diagnose it with a high gradient
conflict rate among competing losses, which we alleviate via the PCGrad
optimization technique.

Method: 结合精确子图枚举和神经网络，通过稀疏正则化实现有效的剪枝策略，同时保持预测性能并识别重要子图。

Result: EIN相比标准图神经网络模型具有足够高的预测性能，并能通过选择的子图进行后验分析。

Conclusion: EIN模型成功实现了高判别性和可解释性的平衡，为图级别预测任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the
information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this
paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the
exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In
general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative
ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our
combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high
discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph.
Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective
pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration
while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important
subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that
EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph
neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on
the selected subgraphs.

Abstract: Understanding urban human mobility patterns at various spatial levels is
essential for social science. This study presents a machine learning framework
to downscale origin-destination (OD) taxi trips flows in New York City from a
larger spatial unit to a smaller spatial unit. First, correlations between OD
trips and demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting characteristics are
developed using four models: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN). Second, a
perturbation-based sensitivity analysis is applied to interpret variable
importance for nonlinear models. The results show that the linear regression
model failed to capture the complex variable interactions. While NN performs
best with the training and testing datasets, SVM shows the best generalization
ability in downscaling performance. The methodology presented in this study
provides both analytical advancement and practical applications to improve
transportation services and urban development.

Motivation: 联邦学习中数据异构性持续挑战全局模型性能，传统方法依赖所有客户端参与全局训练后进行本地适应。本研究关注早期阶段质量控制，在联邦训练过程之前为每个客户端设计定制化训练策略。

Method: PQFed从每个客户端的原始数据中提取代表性特征，应用聚类技术估计客户端间数据集相似性。基于相似性估计，框架实施客户端选择策略，使每个客户端能与数据分布兼容的其他客户端协作。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上集成三种现有联邦学习算法进行测试，PQFed持续提升目标客户端模型性能，即使在参与者数量有限的情况下。与基线聚类算法IFCA相比，在低参与度场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: PQFed在个性化联邦学习设置中展现出良好的可扩展性和有效性，通过早期客户端选择和相似性匹配机制解决了数据异构性挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing raw
data, but data heterogeneity consistently challenges the performance of the
global model. Traditional optimization methods often rely on collaborative
global model training involving all clients, followed by local adaptation to
improve individual performance. In this work, we focus on early-stage quality
control and propose PQFed, a novel privacy-preserving personalized federated
learning framework that designs customized training strategies for each client
prior to the federated training process. PQFed extracts representative features
from each client's raw data and applies clustering techniques to estimate
inter-client dataset similarity. Based on these similarity estimates, the
framework implements a client selection strategy that enables each client to
collaborate with others who have compatible data distributions. We evaluate
PQFed on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST, integrated with three
existing federated learning algorithms. Experimental results show that PQFed
consistently improves the target client's model performance, even with a
limited number of participants. We further benchmark PQFed against a baseline
cluster-based algorithm, IFCA, and observe that PQFed also achieves better
performance in low-participation scenarios. These findings highlight PQFed's
scalability and effectiveness in personalized federated learning settings.

Abstract: Harnessing parallelism in seemingly sequential models is a central challenge
for modern machine learning. Several approaches have been proposed for
evaluating sequential processes in parallel using fixed-point methods, like
Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations. In this work, we show that these methods
can be understood within a common framework based on linear dynamical systems
(LDSs), where different iteration schemes arise naturally as approximate
linearizations of a nonlinear recursion. This unifying view highlights shared
principles behind these techniques and clarifies when particular fixed-point
methods are most likely to be effective. By bridging diverse algorithms through
the language of LDSs, our framework provides a clearer theoretical foundation
for parallelizing sequential models and points toward new opportunities for
efficient and scalable computation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息论的双层贝叶斯优化方法，通过同时考虑上层和下层最优解的信息增益，定义了统一的优化准则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双层优化问题涉及嵌套的上下层优化，且两层都包含昂贵的黑盒函数。由于复杂的嵌套结构，相比其他贝叶斯优化扩展，双层优化研究较少。

Method: 采用信息论方法，同时考虑上层和下层最优解的信息增益，定义统一的优化准则，并提出了基于下界的实用评估方法。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实证验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 信息论方法能够有效处理双层贝叶斯优化问题，通过统一准则同时优化两个层级。

Abstract: A bilevel optimization problem consists of two optimization problems nested
as an upper- and a lower-level problem, in which the optimality of the
lower-level problem defines a constraint for the upper-level problem. This
paper considers Bayesian optimization (BO) for the case that both the upper-
and lower-levels involve expensive black-box functions. Because of its nested
structure, bilevel optimization has a complex problem definition and, compared
with other standard extensions of BO such as multi-objective or constraint
settings, it has not been widely studied. We propose an information-theoretic
approach that considers the information gain of both the upper- and
lower-optimal solutions and values. This enables us to define a unified
criterion that measures the benefit for both level problems, simultaneously.
Further, we also show a practical lower bound based approach to evaluating the
information gain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method through several benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: 开发了一个可解释的时空图神经网络框架，利用双重随机微分方程建模不规则采样的纵向fMRI数据，预测阿尔茨海默病进展，识别关键脑回路异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于脑网络时空特征的复杂功能障碍常被现有方法忽视，识别客观神经影像生物标志物来预测阿尔茨海默病进展具有挑战性但至关重要。

Method: 使用可解释的时空图神经网络框架，结合双重随机微分方程处理不规则采样的纵向fMRI数据，学习稀疏区域和连接重要性概率。

Result: 在OASIS-3和ADNI两个独立队列中验证有效，识别出海马旁回、前额叶皮层和顶叶小叶等关键区域，以及腹侧注意、背侧注意和默认模式网络的显著中断。

Conclusion: 时空图学习方法在早期个体化预测阿尔茨海默病进展方面具有潜力，即使在不规则采样的纵向影像数据背景下也能有效工作。

Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease
(AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains
challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal
characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by
existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD
progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model
the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the
Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse
regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification
of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression.
Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal
lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral
attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities
correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover,
our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural
systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight
the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized
prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled
longitudinal imaging data.

TL;DR: POLO是一个基于大语言模型的药物先导化合物优化框架，通过轨迹级优化和轮次级偏好学习的双重学习机制，显著提高了样本效率，在仅使用500次评估的情况下实现了84%的单属性任务成功率和50%的多属性任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物先导化合物优化方法样本效率低下，现有基于大语言模型的方法未能充分利用迭代过程的优势，将每个优化步骤独立处理。

Method: 提出POLO框架，引入偏好引导策略优化算法，在轨迹级强化成功策略，在轮次级通过排名中间分子提供密集比较反馈。

Result: 在仅使用500次评估的情况下，POLO在单属性任务上达到84%的平均成功率（比基线高2.3倍），在多属性任务上达到50%的成功率。

Conclusion: POLO通过充分挖掘每次昂贵评估的价值，在样本高效的分子优化方面显著推进了最先进水平。

Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast
chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while
preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent
advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample
efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle
evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through
their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align
naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods
fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently.
To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for
Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization
trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces
Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning
algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels:
trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while
turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking
intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning
from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully
exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO
achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than
baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations,
significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular
optimization.

<details>

Motivation: 现有脑图学习方法难以选择性地学习疾病相关知识，导致参数和计算成本过高，限制了在真实临床环境中的实用性

Method: 首先使用过滤器提取由高度疾病相关子图构成的病理模式，实现图剪枝和病灶定位；然后构建PathoGraph，通过丢弃较少疾病相关子图；最后设计病理特征蒸馏模块减少疾病无关噪声特征并增强PathoGraph中每个节点的病理特征

Conclusion: BrainPoG能够专门学习信息丰富的疾病相关知识，同时避免较少相关信息，实现高效的脑图学习

Abstract: Brain graph learning has demonstrated significant achievements in the fields
of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods struggle
to selectively learn disease-related knowledge, leading to heavy parameters and
computational costs. This challenge diminishes their efficiency, as well as
limits their practicality for real-world clinical applications. To this end, we
propose a lightweight Brain PathoGraph Learning (BrainPoG) model that enables
efficient brain graph learning by pathological pattern filtering and
pathological feature distillation. Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a
filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly
disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A
PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs
from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation
module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance
pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively
learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant
information, achieving efficient brain graph learning. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BrainPoG exhibits superiority in both
model performance and computational efficiency across various brain disease
detection tasks.

Motivation: 现有核心集选择方法通常忽略标注错误且需要固定剪枝比例，在真实场景中不实用。

Method: 使用每类轻量级超球面模型，将类内样本嵌入到超球面中心附近，基于距离自然分离类外样本，通过Youden's J统计量自适应选择剪枝阈值。

Result: 实验显示HyperCore在噪声和低数据情况下持续超越最先进的核心集选择方法。

Conclusion: HyperCore能有效丢弃错误标注和模糊点，产生紧凑且信息丰富的子集，适合可扩展和无噪声学习。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets
of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore
the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making
them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and
adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy
environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per
class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally
segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J
statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling
automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our
experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes.
HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding
compact yet highly informative subsets suitable for scalable and noise-free
learning.

Motivation: 现有核心集选择方法需要在整个数据集上计算昂贵的训练信号，这违背了核心集选择避免训练大量样本的初衷。

Method: 提出SubZeroCore方法，将子模覆盖度和密度整合到单一目标中，基于闭式解的采样策略平衡这两个目标，通过单个超参数控制局部密度度量的期望覆盖度。

Result: 无需训练就能达到基于训练基线的性能，在高剪枝率下显著优于现有方法，计算开销大幅减少，对标签噪声具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SubZeroCore展示了在实际场景中的有效性和可扩展性，为高效核心集选择提供了训练免费的解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection is to identify representative subsets of
datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing approaches paradoxically
require expensive training-based signals, e.g., gradients, decision boundary
estimates or forgetting counts, computed over the entire dataset prior to
pruning, which undermines their very purpose by requiring training on samples
they aim to avoid. We introduce SubZeroCore, a novel, training-free coreset
selection method that integrates submodular coverage and density into a single,
unified objective. To achieve this, we introduce a sampling strategy based on a
closed-form solution to optimally balance these objectives, guided by a single
hyperparameter that explicitly controls the desired coverage for local density
measures. Despite no training, extensive evaluations show that SubZeroCore
matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high
pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. SubZeroCore
also demonstrates superior robustness to label noise, highlighting its
practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统4DVAR代价函数优化困难且计算密集，需要解决时间序列依赖问题并简化实现。

Method: 使用神经网络参数化时空状态函数，通过物理约束损失直接融入物理规律，实现参数空间并行优化。

Result: 在二维不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程测试中，相比基线4DVAR，该方法产生更稳定的初始条件估计，无虚假振荡。

Conclusion: 该框架无需真实状态或再分析数据，扩展了在有限参考信息场景下的适用性，是传统4DVAR的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) is a cornerstone of
numerical weather prediction, but its cost function is difficult to optimize
and computationally intensive. We propose a neural field-based reformulation in
which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function
parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the
time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time
optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly
through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing
computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a
baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variants produce more
stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations. Notably,
unlike most machine learning-based approaches, our framework does not require
access to ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening its applicability
to settings with limited reference information.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多发性硬化症患者常抱怨手部灵巧性和认知疲劳问题，但损伤往往细微难以检测。研究旨在发现能解释认知疲劳的脑活动生物标志物，为未来脑刺激治疗提供靶点。

Method: 招募15名无手部、活动或认知障碍的MS患者和12名匹配对照，完成单任务和双任务手部灵巧测试，使用fNIRS测量双侧前额叶和感觉运动皮层脑血流动力学反应，采用机器学习框架分析数据。

Result: K-近邻分类器在单任务中准确率达75.0%，双任务中66.7%。XAI显示最重要的脑区是对侧半球上缘/角回和前中央回，MS组活动抑制且神经血管反应减慢。脱氧血红蛋白比氧合血红蛋白是更好的预测指标。

Conclusion: 这种非传统的fNIRS数据分析方法揭示了新的脑活动生物标志物，有助于开发个性化脑刺激靶点。

Abstract: People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) complain of problems with hand dexterity
and cognitive fatigue. However, in many cases, impairments are subtle and
difficult to detect. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a
non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain hemodynamic responses
during cognitive or motor tasks. We aimed to detect brain activity biomarkers
that could explain subjective reports of cognitive fatigue while completing
dexterous tasks and provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments. We
recruited 15 people with MS who did not have a hand (Nine Hole Peg Test
[NHPT]), mobility, or cognitive impairment, and 12 age- and sex-matched
controls. Participants completed two types of hand dexterity tasks with their
dominant hand, single task and dual task (NHPT while holding a ball between the
fifth finger and hypothenar eminence of the same hand). We analyzed fNIRS data
(oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels) using a machine learning
framework to classify MS patients from controls based on their brain activation
patterns in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. The K-Nearest
Neighbor classifier achieved an accuracy of 75.0% for single manual dexterity
tasks and 66.7% for the more complex dual manual dexterity tasks. Using XAI, we
found that the most important brain regions contributing to the machine
learning model were the supramarginal/angular gyri and the precentral gyrus
(sensory integration and motor regions) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, with
suppressed activity and slower neurovascular response in the MS group. During
both tasks, deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the
conventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin. This nonconventional method of
fNIRS data analysis revealed novel brain activity biomarkers that can help
develop personalized brain stimulation targets.

TL;DR: 提出了有效信息准则(EIC)，通过评估公式在有限计算精度下的数值稳定性来衡量其结构合理性，从而提升符号回归方法发现的公式的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法仅使用复杂度指标作为可解释性的代理，忽略了公式的内部数学结构，导致发现的公式虽然形式紧凑但结构难以分析。

Method: 将公式视为具有特定内部结构的信息处理系统，通过数据流经系统时的有效数字损失或舍入噪声放大来识别不合理结构。

Result: 结合EIC可提升搜索式符号回归算法在帕累托前沿的性能，减少结果中的不合理结构；结合生成式算法可将预训练所需样本数减少2-4倍；EIC与108位人类专家对公式可解释性偏好的吻合度达70.2%。

Conclusion: EIC通过测量公式中的不合理结构，实际上反映了公式的可解释性，为符号回归提供了更有效的结构合理性评估标准。

Abstract: Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe
given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and
promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods
often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only
considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical
structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the
discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or
interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that
physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation
precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats
formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures
and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant
digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system.
We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality
of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world
physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression
algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the
irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based
algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving
sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar
accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts'
preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring
the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在提升大语言模型推理能力方面潜力巨大，但实际部署受限于训练过程过慢，主要由于每个查询需要自回归生成多个响应，使生成阶段成为主要性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出并发感知推测解码框架，根据实时并发水平动态调整草稿和验证策略；引入在线草稿学习机制，使草稿模型能够持续适应目标模型的分布变化。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集和模型上的实验结果表明，该方法实现了2.35倍到2.72倍的端到端加速，显著超越了基线方法的效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的并发感知推测解码框架有效解决了GRPO训练中的性能瓶颈问题，大幅提升了训练效率，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant
potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded
by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the
computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per
query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck.
Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration,
its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency
training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the
drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels,
thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to
address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the
evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce
an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously
adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across
multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly
surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency. The code is available at

Conclusion: 混沌系统泛化能力源于训练系统的多样性而非数据量，为科学基础模型提供了指导原则。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather
prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The
inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a
scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling
approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system,
they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications,
which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited
scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a
foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics.
ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented
with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and
system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a
large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it
improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40%
compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world
applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global
weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error
below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning.
Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding
principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems
from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.

Conclusion: 本研究为材料性能预测领域的神经网络缩放提供了实证基础，未来可以进一步研究其他神经网络模型（如GemNet和全连接网络）的缩放规律。

Abstract: Predicting material properties is crucial for designing better batteries,
semiconductors, and medical devices. Deep learning helps scientists quickly
find promising materials by predicting their energy, forces, and stresses.
Companies scale capacities of deep learning models in multiple domains, such as
language modeling, and invest many millions of dollars into such models. Our
team analyzes how scaling training data (giving models more information to
learn from), model sizes (giving models more capacity to learn patterns), and
compute (giving models more computational resources) for neural networks
affects their performance for material property prediction. In particular, we
trained both transformer and EquiformerV2 neural networks to predict material
properties. We find empirical scaling laws for these models: we can predict how
increasing each of the three hyperparameters (training data, model size, and
compute) affects predictive performance. In particular, the loss $L$ can be
measured with a power law relationship $L = \alpha \cdot N^{-\beta}$, where
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants while $N$ is the relevant hyperparameter. We
also incorporate command-line arguments for changing training settings such as
the amount of epochs, maximum learning rate, and whether mixed precision is
enabled. Future work could entail further investigating scaling laws for other
neural network models in this domain, such as GemNet and fully connected
networks, to assess how they compare to the models we trained.

work, however, we show that SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers --
points that are not minimizers of the original objective. We theoretically
prove the existence of such hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions
for local convergence to them. We further provide empirical evidence
demonstrating that SAM can indeed converge to these points in practice.
Finally, we propose a simple yet effective remedy for avoiding hallucinated
minimizers.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了在线多智能体强化学习中的稀疏奖励挑战，展示了其在复杂环境中的实用价值。

Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in
environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each
interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though
realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards
hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To
address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse
preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified
architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent
reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition
network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are
further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated
learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In
addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to
provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model.
Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and
SMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward
challenges in online MARL.

TL;DR: 本文对掩码离散扩散进行了理论分析，提出了MATU方法，在消除有界分数假设的同时实现了近乎ε无关的复杂度，证明了掩码离散扩散在文本生成中的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码离散扩散在文本生成中表现出强大的经验性能，但其在高维设置下的理论复杂性尚未得到充分理解。现有分析主要关注均匀离散扩散，而对掩码扩散的分析存在三个主要问题：忽略广泛使用的欧拉采样器、施加限制性有界分数假设、未能展示掩码离散扩散相对于均匀扩散的优势。

Method: 首先证明了欧拉采样器可以在总变差距离上达到ε精度，需要O(d²ε^{-3/2})次离散分数评估。然后提出了掩码感知截断均匀化(MATU)方法，该方法消除了有界分数假设并保持无偏离散分数逼近。通过利用每个标记最多只能被解掩码一次的特性，MATU实现了近乎ε无关的复杂度。

Result: MATU方法实现了O(d ln d·(1-ε²))的复杂度，超越了现有均匀离散扩散下的均匀化方法，消除了ln(1/ε)因子并显著加速了收敛。

Conclusion: 研究结果为掩码离散扩散提供了严格的理论基础，展示了其在文本生成中相对于均匀扩散的实际优势，并为分析基于掩码范式的扩散语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion -- a flexible paradigm for text generation
in which tokens are progressively corrupted by special mask symbols before
being denoised. Although this approach has demonstrated strong empirical
performance, its theoretical complexity in high-dimensional settings remains
insufficiently understood. Existing analyses largely focus on uniform discrete
diffusion, and more recent attempts addressing masked diffusion either (1)
overlook widely used Euler samplers, (2) impose restrictive bounded-score
assumptions, or (3) fail to showcase the advantages of masked discrete
diffusion over its uniform counterpart. To address this gap, we show that Euler
samplers can achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy in total variation (TV) with
$\tilde{O}(d^{2}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ discrete score evaluations, thereby providing
the first rigorous analysis of typical Euler sampler in masked discrete
diffusion. We then propose a Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU)
approach that both removes bounded-score assumptions and preserves unbiased
discrete score approximation. By exploiting the property that each token can be
unmasked at most once, MATU attains a nearly $\epsilon$-free complexity of
$O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-\epsilon^2))$. This result surpasses existing
uniformization methods under uniform discrete diffusion, eliminating the
$\ln(1/\epsilon)$ factor and substantially speeding up convergence. Our
findings not only provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete
diffusion, showcasing its practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text
generation, but also pave the way for future efforts to analyze diffusion-based
language models developed under masking paradigm.

TL;DR: 提出Graph of Agents框架，通过信息论压缩目标动态构建多智能体协作结构，解决长上下文建模问题，在多个文档问答基准上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统处理长上下文时依赖人工设计的协作策略和提示工程，限制了泛化能力，需要更原则性的方法。

Method: 将长上下文建模形式化为压缩问题，提出信息论压缩目标，构建动态输入依赖的协作结构Graph of Agents。

Result: 在6个文档问答基准上，GoA将检索增强生成的F1分数平均提升5.7%，比固定协作结构基线提升16.35%，仅用2K上下文窗口就能超越128K窗口模型。

Conclusion: GoA框架能显著提高有效上下文长度，为模型无关的长上下文建模提供了原则性解决方案。

Abstract: As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems
can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without
retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often
heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt
engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a
principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling
problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression
objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which
dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that
maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document
question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of
retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using
a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K
context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on
LongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length. Our source

Motivation: 现有分子基础模型主要依赖SMILES表示，忽略了实验光谱和3D结构信息这两个在真实场景中捕捉分子行为的关键来源，限制了其在立体化学、空间构象和实验验证关键任务中的有效性。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-7B预训练，明确建模分子光谱，将实验光谱与分子3D结构统一起来。

Result: 在光谱相关任务上达到最先进性能，NMR、IR和MS基准测试平均准确率为0.53；在光谱分析任务上，Spectra-to-SMILES序列准确率15.5%，标记准确率41.7%，显著优于大型通用LLM；能够直接从SMILES或光谱输入生成准确的3D分子结构。

Conclusion: MolSpectLLM不仅能在分子解析任务上表现优异，还能桥接光谱分析、分子解析和分子设计，为分子基础模型提供了更全面的能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive
performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with
promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction.
Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES
representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural
information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in
real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks
where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are
critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular
foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental
spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular
spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related
tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks.
MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task,
obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on
Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More
importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular
elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly
from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular
elucidation, and molecular design.

Conclusion: LDAR方法通过平衡信息覆盖与干扰的权衡，在减少token使用的同时提升性能，证明了自适应检索在应对长上下文挑战中的重要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large
Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent
advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K
tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document
context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset
of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable
limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially
redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon;
and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately
degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning
Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve
contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages,
thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage
compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM
architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of
balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.

Motivation: 解决单独使用ILP需要指定背景知识且计算成本高，或单独使用MLLMs存在感知幻觉的问题，结合两者优势进行逻辑规则归纳。

Method: 利用MLLMs提出结构正确的规则，基于这些规则结构自动构建ILP任务并修剪搜索空间，然后使用ILP系统基于修正的逻辑事实和形式归纳推理输出规则。

Result: 在具有挑战性的逻辑归纳基准测试中验证了有效性，并展示了在文本到图像定制生成中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: ILP-CoT成功结合了ILP和MLLMs的优势，有效解决了逻辑规则归纳中的关键挑战。

Abstract: We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule
induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing
logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs,
which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the
requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or
MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key
observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under
hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search
spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP
system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive
reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction
benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely
text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are
released at https://github.com/future-item/ILP-CoT.

Motivation: 解决神经ODE在输入扰动下鲁棒性与准确性之间的张力问题，现有方法难以施加合适的稳定性条件来提供形式化鲁棒性保证。

Method: 将Zubov方程重新表述为吸引区域与规定吸引区域之间的一致性表征，引入三方损失（一致性、分类和分离损失）和并行边界采样算法，设计基于输入注意力的凸神经网络。

Result: Zubov-Net在保持高分类准确性的同时，显著提高了对各种随机噪声和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过最小化三方损失可以保证规定吸引区域与吸引区域的一致性对齐、轨迹稳定性和非重叠规定吸引区域，理论证明具有更紧的概率界限和更少的维度要求。

Abstract: Despite neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) exhibiting
intrinsic robustness under input perturbations due to their dynamical systems
nature, recent approaches often involve imposing Lyapunov-based stability
conditions to provide formal robustness guarantees. However, a fundamental
challenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily
stemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To
address this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net,
which innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency
characterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs
(PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively
controlling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile
accuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses
(consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary
sampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function.
To enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an
input-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism
that focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight
normalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures.
Theoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees
consistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping
PRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter
probability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex
design in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high
classification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against
various stochastic noises and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: RLVR具有实用价值且已具备工业应用条件，但需要采用更可靠的评估协议来准确衡量推理能力的真实提升，同时关注可靠性、安全性和测量准确性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and
scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math,
code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much
of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and
whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is
real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax,
evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt
contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models,
we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean,
parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and
evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated
abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent
RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains
and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive:
RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits
while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.

Method: 提出增量向量变换(IVT)框架，定期将模型参数传送到保持与先前任务最优解线性连接的变换解，使用对角Fisher信息矩阵高效近似变换

Result: 在CIFAR-100上提升PASS基线最后准确率+5.12%，减少遗忘2.54%；在FGVCAircraft上提升CLIP预训练SLCA基线平均准确率+14.93%，最后准确率+21.95%

Conclusion: IVT能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，兼容多种初始化策略，适用于无示例和有示例场景，显著增强强CIL基线的性能

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of
new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent
progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps
compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to
historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),
we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a
fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss
linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,
we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play
framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather
than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model
parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to
previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,
IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The
transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information
Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based
scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full
demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL
baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the
PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the
CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in
average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等高风险领域应用机器学习时，可解释性至关重要。GAMs虽然可解释性强但忽略了高阶交互效应，CESR虽然包含所有特征交互但性能不如GAMs，需要一种既能保持可解释性又能提高性能的模型。

Method: MACMs在CESR基础上增加加法部分，分离交互项和独立项的系数，扩展假设空间。模型由乘法部分和加法部分组成，两者都可以自然可视化形状函数。

Result: 基于神经网络的MACMs在预测性能上显著优于CESR和最先进的GAMs。

Conclusion: MACMs通过结合乘法交互和加法独立效应，在保持可解释性的同时提高了预测性能，是对CESR和GAMs的改进。

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

Conclusion: 有限训练样本下生成模型的理论行为得到系统分析，揭示了不同生成过程的表现特征及其在估计误差下的变化规律。

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical behavior of generative models under
finite training populations. Within the stochastic interpolation generative
framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and
score function when only a finite number of training samples are available. We
demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the deterministic
generative process exactly recovers the training samples, while the stochastic
generative process manifests as training samples with added Gaussian noise.
Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce
formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative
models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in the presence of estimation
errors, the stochastic generation process effectively produces convex
combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian
noise. Experiments on generation tasks and downstream tasks such as
classification support our theory.

Abstract: The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and
recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale
characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that
fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations
of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using
continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture
temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable
VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and
provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on
real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully
monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate
optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves
validation losses of 0.0952 with CWTs and 0.1064 with RPs on the University of
Sharjah energy dataset, outperforming direct fine-tuning on raw time-series
data (0.1176) for anomaly detection. This work bridges time-series analysis and
visualization, providing a scalable and interpretable framework for energy

Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation.
Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear)
remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the
easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap
through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the
output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random
location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of
attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization
performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population
level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention
fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to
identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we
analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of
the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it
consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with

*Xianghua Zeng,Hao Peng,Angsheng Li,Yicheng Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SIHD，一种基于结构信息的分层扩散框架，用于在稀疏奖励的长时程环境中进行有效稳定的离线策略学习，通过自适应构建扩散层次和多时间尺度轨迹建模来提升决策性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分层扩散方法通常假设固定的两层扩散层次和单一预定义时间尺度，这限制了适应不同下游任务的灵活性，并降低了决策制定的灵活性。

Method: 分析离线轨迹中的结构信息来自适应构建扩散层次，量化每个状态社区的结构信息增益作为扩散层的条件信号，并引入结构熵正则化器来鼓励探索代表性不足的状态。

Result: 在具有挑战性的离线RL任务上的广泛评估表明，SIHD在决策性能上显著优于最先进的基线方法，并在多样化场景中展现出优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SIHD框架通过自适应层次构建和结构信息利用，有效解决了长时程稀疏奖励环境中的离线策略学习问题，提供了更灵活和稳定的决策制定能力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative methods have shown promising potential for
modeling trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, and
hierarchical diffusion has been introduced to mitigate variance accumulation
and computational challenges in long-horizon planning tasks. However, existing
approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single
predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream
tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose
SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for
effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with
sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in
offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling
flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than
relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the
structural information gain of each state community and use it as a
conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce
overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer
that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding
extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on
challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates
superior generalization across diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Active Attacks算法，通过自适应探索机制在RL红队测试中生成多样化的攻击提示，显著提升攻击成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RL红队测试方法在生成多样化攻击提示时容易陷入局部最优的问题，需要显式的多样性目标来覆盖广泛的恶意行为

Method: 基于主动学习思想，通过定期对受害者LLM进行安全微调来降低已探索区域的奖励，迫使攻击者寻找新的漏洞区域，形成从易到难的探索课程

Result: 相比现有最佳方法GFlowNets，跨攻击成功率从0.07%提升至31.28%（相对提升超过400倍），计算成本仅增加6%

Conclusion: Active Attacks作为即插即用模块能有效提升RL红队测试的多样性，通过自适应探索机制实现多模态分布的广泛覆盖

Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large
language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual
content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual
prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning
(RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as
a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant
challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing
diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward
prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the
active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce
\textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its
attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim
LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which
forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally
induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses
beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active
Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their
combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active
Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing
RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including
GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates
against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a
relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in
computation. Our code is publicly available

TL;DR: 提出了一种难度自适应推理方法，让大型音频语言模型能够根据问题复杂度动态调整推理深度，避免简单问题过度推理和复杂问题推理不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常采用固定的推理深度，导致简单问题过度推理而复杂问题推理不足，需要一种能够根据问题难度自适应调整推理深度的机制。

Method: 提出奖励函数，动态地将推理长度与模型感知的问题难度联系起来，鼓励简单任务使用简短推理，复杂任务使用详细推理。

Result: 实验表明该方法既有效又高效，同时提高了任务性能并显著减少了平均推理长度。

Conclusion: 难度自适应推理方法为大型音频语言模型提供了智能推理能力，并为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), powered by the chain-of-thought (CoT)
paradigm, have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities. Intuitively, different
problems often require varying depths of reasoning. While some methods can
determine whether to reason for a given problem, they typically lack a
fine-grained mechanism to modulate how much to reason. This often results in a
``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking
for simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex
ones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an
effective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning
depth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a
difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a
reward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's
perceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning
for easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and
efficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing
the average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm
offers valuable insights for future work.

TL;DR: GRAMDTI是一个多模态预训练框架，通过整合分子和蛋白质的多模态信息来改进药物靶点相互作用预测，采用体积对比学习和自适应模态丢弃技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DTI预测方法主要依赖SMILES-蛋白质对，未能充分利用小分子和蛋白质的丰富多模态信息。

Method: 使用四模态体积对比学习捕获高阶语义对齐，提出自适应模态丢弃动态调节各模态贡献，并整合IC50活性测量作为弱监督。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，GRAMDTI持续优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 高阶多模态对齐、自适应模态利用和辅助监督对构建稳健且可泛化的DTI预测模型具有重要价值。

Abstract: Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational
drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic
insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches
primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal
information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a
pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs
into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning
to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond
conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we
propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's
contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements,
when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations
in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly
available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of
the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order
multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision
for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.

*Cheng Jin,Qitan Shi,Yuantao Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了分类器自由引导(CFG)在扩散模型中的采样动态影响，揭示了CFG在采样过程中分为三个阶段：方向偏移、模式分离和集中阶段，解释了为什么强引导会提高语义对齐但减少多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CFG被广泛用于提高扩散模型的条件保真度，但其对采样动态的影响仍未被充分理解，特别是在多模态条件下的行为机制尚不明确。

Method: 通过分析多模态条件下的CFG采样过程，识别出三个连续的采样阶段，并基于理论分析提出时间变化的引导调度策略。

Result: 实验证实早期强引导会侵蚀全局多样性，后期强引导会抑制细粒度变化，而提出的时间变化引导调度能同时提高质量和多样性。

Conclusion: CFG的采样过程具有明确的阶段性特征，通过理解这些动态特性可以设计更优的引导策略，在保持条件保真度的同时维护生成多样性。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used to improve conditional fidelity
in diffusion models, but its impact on sampling dynamics remains poorly
understood. Prior studies, often restricted to unimodal conditional
distributions or simplified cases, provide only a partial picture. We analyze
CFG under multimodal conditionals and show that the sampling process unfolds in
three successive stages. In the Direction Shift stage, guidance accelerates
movement toward the weighted mean, introducing initialization bias and norm
growth. In the Mode Separation stage, local dynamics remain largely neutral,
but the inherited bias suppresses weaker modes, reducing global diversity. In
the Concentration stage, guidance amplifies within-mode contraction,
diminishing fine-grained variability. This unified view explains a widely
observed phenomenon: stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but
inevitably reduces diversity. Experiments support these predictions, showing
that early strong guidance erodes global diversity, while late strong guidance
suppresses fine-grained variation. Moreover, our theory naturally suggests a
time-varying guidance schedule, and empirical results confirm that it
consistently improves both quality and diversity.

Motivation: 现实决策任务环境复杂开放，传统RL方法在探索效率和长期规划方面存在挑战，现有LLM增强RL方法存在频繁调用成本高和语义不匹配问题。

Method: SGRL方法包含结构化目标规划器和目标条件动作剪枝器，前者利用LLM生成带优先级权重的可重用目标生成函数，后者通过动作掩码机制过滤与目标不一致的动作。

Result: 在Crafter和Craftax-Classic环境上的实验结果表明，SGRL相比现有最优方法取得了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: SGRL方法通过结构化目标规划和动作剪枝机制，有效提升了RL在复杂环境中的探索效率和决策质量，证明了LLM与RL结合的有效性。

Abstract: Real-world decision-making tasks typically occur in complex and open
environments, posing significant challenges to reinforcement learning (RL)
agents' exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning capabilities. A
promising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge
and strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient
exploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM
invocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch.
In this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning
(SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned
action pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically,
the structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured
function for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by
utilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates
forward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising
decision-making trajectories. The goal-conditioned action pruner employs an
action masking mechanism that filters out actions misaligned with the current
goal, thereby constraining the RL agent to select goal-consistent policies. We
evaluate the proposed method on Crafter and Craftax-Classic, and experimental
results demonstrate that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Concept-SAE是一个引入语义基础概念标记的框架，通过混合解缠策略解决标准稀疏自编码器特征模糊和不可靠的问题，支持因果干预和对抗漏洞定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准稀疏自编码器发现的特征具有模糊性和无基础性，使其在主动因果探测模型行为时不可靠。

Method: 采用双重监督的混合解缠策略，生成语义基础的概念标记。

Result: 该方法产生的标记具有显著忠实性和空间局部性，在解缠方面优于替代方法，支持因果干预和对抗漏洞定位。

Conclusion: Concept-SAE为从相关性解释转向机制性、因果性模型行为探测提供了验证蓝图。

Abstract: Standard Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) excel at discovering a dictionary of a
model's learned features, offering a powerful observational lens. However, the
ambiguous and ungrounded nature of these features makes them unreliable
instruments for the active, causal probing of model behavior. To solve this, we
introduce Concept-SAE, a framework that forges semantically grounded concept
tokens through a novel hybrid disentanglement strategy. We first quantitatively
demonstrate that our dual-supervision approach produces tokens that are
remarkably faithful and spatially localized, outperforming alternative methods
in disentanglement. This validated fidelity enables two critical applications:
(1) we probe the causal link between internal concepts and predictions via
direct intervention, and (2) we probe the model's failure modes by
systematically localizing adversarial vulnerabilities to specific layers.
Concept-SAE provides a validated blueprint for moving beyond correlational
interpretation to the mechanistic, causal probing of model behavior.

TL;DR: AEGIS框架通过重采样现有训练边来增强稀疏二分知识图谱，避免伪造端点，在稀疏图中提升链接预测性能

Motivation: 解决稀疏二分知识图谱中数据不足和边稀疏导致的链接预测困难问题

Method: 提出AEGIS边增强框架，采用均匀重采样或逆度偏置重采样现有训练边，保持原始节点集，避免伪造端点

Result: 在Amazon和MovieLens上，基于复制的AEGIS变体与基线相当，语义KNN增强是唯一能恢复AUC和校准的方法；在GDP图上，语义KNN获得最大AUC改进和Brier分数降低

Conclusion: 真实性约束的重采样是稀疏二分链接预测的数据高效策略，当有信息丰富的节点描述时，语义增强能提供额外提升

Abstract: Bipartite knowledge graphs in niche domains are typically data-poor and
edge-sparse, which hinders link prediction. We introduce AEGIS (Authentic Edge
Growth In Sparsity), an edge-only augmentation framework that resamples
existing training edges -either uniformly simple or with inverse-degree bias
degree-aware -thereby preserving the original node set and sidestepping
fabricated endpoints. To probe authenticity across regimes, we consider
naturally sparse graphs (game design pattern's game-pattern network) and induce
sparsity in denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens) via high-rate bond
percolation. We evaluate augmentations on two complementary metrics: AUC-ROC
(higher is better) and the Brier score (lower is better), using two-tailed
paired t-tests against sparse baselines. On Amazon and MovieLens, copy-based
AEGIS variants match the baseline while the semantic KNN augmentation is the
only method that restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges
remain detrimental. On the text-rich GDP graph, semantic KNN achieves the
largest AUC improvement and Brier score reduction, and simple also lowers the
Brier score relative to the sparse control. These findings position
authenticity-constrained resampling as a data-efficient strategy for sparse
bipartite link prediction, with semantic augmentation providing an additional
boost when informative node descriptions are available.

Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法无法有效处理天气下游任务的独特挑战，如变量异质性、分辨率多样性和时空覆盖变化，导致在天气基础模型上性能不佳。

Method: WeatherPEFT包含两个创新：1) 前向传播中的任务自适应动态提示，通过内外模式提取动态注入嵌入权重；2) 反向传播中的随机Fisher引导自适应选择，利用Fisher信息识别关键参数并引入随机性稳定选择。

Result: 在三个下游任务上，WeatherPEFT实现了与全微调相当的性能，同时使用更少的可训练参数，而现有PEFT方法相比全微调存在显著差距。

Conclusion: WeatherPEFT为天气基础模型提供了一个高效且有效的微调解决方案，能够在保持预训练知识的同时适应特定下游任务需求。

Abstract: While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation
Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse
downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with
their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language
tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such
as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage
variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge
this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs
incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass,
Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding
weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via
internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature
recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during
backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only
leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical
parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also
introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where
existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT
achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters.
The code of this work will be released.

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将模仿学习与搜索策略结合，为LLM解决组合优化问题提供了有效途径，并建立了与Min-Sum Set Cover的理论联系。

Abstract: Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models
(LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling
Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel
approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic
task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior
neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures,
our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external
tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple
Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy
involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning,
we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide
a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual
variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and
stochastic optimization.

TL;DR: MCGM是一个轻量级插件模块，通过高效聚类操作赋予几何图神经网络层次化全局上下文，解决了传统方法在建模长程相互作用时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何图神经网络在捕捉分子几何结构方面表现出色，但其局部偏置的消息传递机制难以有效建模长程相互作用。现有解决方案存在根本性限制：扩展截断半径会导致计算成本随距离立方增长；物理启发核函数缺乏通用性；傅里叶空间方法需要复杂参数调优且计算开销大。

Method: MCGM通过多阶段聚类全局建模，构建原子簇的多分辨率层次结构，通过动态层次聚类提取全局信息，并通过学习变换传播这些上下文，最终通过残差连接增强原子特征。该模块可无缝集成到多种骨干架构中。

Result: 在OE62能量预测任务中，MCGM平均减少26.2%的误差。在AQM数据集上，MCGM实现了最先进的精度（能量17.0 meV，力4.9 meV/Å），同时比Neural P3M少使用20%的参数。

Conclusion: MCGM是一个轻量级、即插即用的模块，能够有效增强几何图神经网络的全局建模能力，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升长程相互作用的建模性能。

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing molecular geometry,
yet their locality-biased message passing hampers the modeling of long-range
interactions. Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff
radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance;
physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific
and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple
parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead.
We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight,
plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global
context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution
hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic
hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned
transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual
connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures,
MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for
forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made

Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器存在特征吸收（专用特征捕获通用特征实例）和特征组合（独立特征合并为复合表示）的问题，需要改进特征表示质量。

Method: 引入正交性约束，通过惩罚高余弦相似度来强制特征正交，新的训练过程线性扩展计算量，避免显著计算开销。

Result: OrtSAE发现9%更多独特特征，减少特征吸收65%和特征组合15%，在虚假相关性去除任务上性能提升6%，其他下游任务性能与传统SAE相当。

Conclusion: OrtSAE通过正交性约束有效缓解了特征吸收和组合问题，提升了特征解耦能力，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a technique for sparse decomposition of neural
network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs
suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of
general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where
independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we
introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these
issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing
a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between
SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while
scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational
overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it
with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features,
reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves
performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par
performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.

TL;DR: MO-GRPO是一种针对多目标强化学习的改进算法，通过自动归一化奖励函数来解决GRPO算法在奖励模型不可靠时的奖励劫持问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO算法在奖励模型准确时表现良好，但在实际任务中往往缺乏可靠的奖励模型。特别是在多目标设置下，GRPO容易发生奖励劫持，即过度优化某个目标而牺牲其他目标。

Method: 提出MO-GRPO算法，通过简单的归一化方法根据奖励值的方差自动重新加权奖励函数，确保所有奖励函数对损失函数贡献均衡，同时保持偏好顺序不变。

Conclusion: MO-GRPO是多目标强化学习问题中一个有前景的算法，无需手动调整奖励函数尺度即可实现稳定学习。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has been shown to be an effective
algorithm when an accurate reward model is available. However, such a highly
reliable reward model is not available in many real-world tasks. In this paper,
we particularly focus on multi-objective settings, in which we identify that
GRPO is vulnerable to reward hacking, optimizing only one of the objectives at
the cost of the others. To address this issue, we propose MO-GRPO, an extension
of GRPO with a simple normalization method to reweight the reward functions
automatically according to the variances of their values. We first show
analytically that MO-GRPO ensures that all reward functions contribute evenly
to the loss function while preserving the order of preferences, eliminating the
need for manual tuning of the reward functions' scales. Then, we evaluate
MO-GRPO experimentally in four domains: (i) the multi-armed bandits problem,
(ii) simulated control task (Mo-Gymnasium), (iii) machine translation tasks on

achieves stable learning by evenly distributing correlations among the

TL;DR: BrainPro是一个大型EEG基础模型，通过检索式空间学习模块和脑状态解耦模块，解决了现有模型在通道间交互和状态感知表示学习方面的不足，在多个BCI数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型未能显式捕捉通道间和脑区间的交互信息，且由于不同数据集的电极配置差异，要么用自注意力近似空间结构，要么限制在有限通道上训练。此外，当前模型很少在自监督预训练中学习状态感知表示。

Method: 提出BrainPro模型，包含检索式空间学习模块（灵活捕捉不同电极布局下的通道和脑区级交互）和脑状态解耦模块（通过并行编码器与解耦和区域感知重建损失实现状态感知表示学习）。

Result: 在广泛EEG语料库上预训练后，BrainPro在9个公共BCI数据集上实现了最先进的性能和鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: BrainPro通过创新的空间学习和状态解耦设计，能够无缝适应多样化任务和硬件设置，显著提升了EEG解码的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and
healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have
shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding
methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to
explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which
are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to
varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial
structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common
channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG
datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others,
current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised
pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model
that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture
channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a
brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning
through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction
losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and
hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI
datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.

TL;DR: 提出在教师模型训练中引入类内对比损失，以增强软标签中的类内多样性信息，并通过边缘损失解决训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法中，教师模型主要遵循真实标签作为目标，没有考虑同一类别内的多样化表示，限制了学生模型的泛化能力。

Method: 在教师训练中引入类内对比损失来丰富软标签中的类内信息，同时集成边缘损失以提高训练稳定性和收敛速度。

Result: 理论分析证明类内对比损失能够丰富类内多样性，实验结果表明所提方法有效。

Conclusion: 通过类内对比损失和边缘损失的结合，能够有效提升知识蒸馏中软标签的质量，增强学生模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how
the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively.
Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels
originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature
variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to
generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing
distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth
labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the
same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss
during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft
labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in
training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is
integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training
stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the
impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It
has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

Result: 研究确定了继承参数作为通用知识载体的作用，识别了增强其对目标任务有益影响的关键因素，并解释了参数迁移在某些情况下效果不佳的原因。

Conclusion: 本文为参数迁移提供了理论分析框架，阐明了部分参数迁移的有效性条件，并通过实验验证了理论发现。

Abstract: Parameter transfer is a central paradigm in transfer learning, enabling
knowledge reuse across tasks and domains by sharing model parameters between
upstream and downstream models. However, when only a subset of parameters from
the upstream model is transferred to the downstream model, there remains a lack
of theoretical understanding of the conditions under which such partial
parameter reuse is beneficial and of the factors that govern its effectiveness.
To address this gap, we analyze a setting in which both the upstream and
downstream models are ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this
theoretical framework, we characterize how the inherited parameters act as
carriers of universal knowledge and identify key factors that amplify their
beneficial impact on the target task. Furthermore, our analysis provides
insight into why, in certain cases, transferring parameters can lead to lower
test accuracy on the target task than training a new model from scratch.
Numerical experiments and real-world data experiments are conducted to
empirically validate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 激活导向技术通过向LLM隐藏状态添加语义向量来控制模型行为，但研究发现这种方法会系统性破坏模型的安全防护，使其更容易响应有害请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究激活导向技术对LLM安全性的实际影响，挑战"可解释性等于安全性"的假设。

Method: 在不同模型家族上进行广泛实验，测试随机方向导向和基于稀疏自编码器的良性特征导向对有害请求合规率的影响。

Result: 随机方向导向使有害合规率从0%提升至2-27%；基于SAE的良性特征导向进一步增加2-4%；组合20个随机向量可创建通用攻击。

Conclusion: 精确控制模型内部状态并不能保证精确控制模型行为，挑战了通过可解释性实现安全的范式。

Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by
adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states
during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and
potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite:
steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply
with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model
families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the
probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign
features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable
directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that
combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a
universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen
requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through
interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not
guarantee precise control over model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于代理模型的方法如SME假设线性参数轨迹，但低估了SGD的非线性复杂性，限制了攻击效果。需要更准确地建模SGD的非线性特性来提升梯度反转攻击能力。

Method: 提出非线性代理模型扩展(NL-SME)，用可学习的二次贝塞尔曲线替代线性插值，通过控制点捕捉SGD的曲线特征，结合正则化和dvec缩放机制增强表达能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和FEMNIST数据集上的实验表明，NL-SME在所有指标上显著优于基线方法，在余弦相似度损失上实现了数量级改进，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了FL多步更新范式中的隐私漏洞，并为开发鲁棒防御策略提供了新视角。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, yet
Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose significant threats. In FedAVG
multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data
reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume
linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates
SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We
propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to
introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach
replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that
capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with
regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME
significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving
order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining
computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities
in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing
robust defense strategies.

Method: 开发了时间感知的算法追索框架，显式建模候选人群对建议的适应性响应，并引入基于强化学习的追索算法来捕捉环境演化动态

Result: 在复杂模拟环境中的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线方法，在可行性和长期有效性之间提供了更优的平衡

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了将时间和行为动态纳入实用追索系统设计的重要性

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable
recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes
from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research
has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has
been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive,
resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant
pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic
recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to
recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the
environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We
design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined
time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after
taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments
in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially
outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility
and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of
incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical
recourse systems.

Motivation: 心理属性很少孤立运作，教练需要理解相关特征之间的网络关系。现有方法在处理混合类型变量（序数问卷分数、分类人口统计、连续指标）时存在局限。

Method: 引入潜在MMHC，结合潜在高斯copula和基于约束的骨架，通过约束的基于分数的细化来返回单个有向无环图，并研究了自举聚合变体以提高稳定性。

Result: 在模拟实验中，潜在MMHC在结构汉明距离和边召回率方面优于最近的copula学习方法，同时保持高特异性。在排球应用中，学习到的网络围绕目标设定和自信组织心理技能，情绪唤起连接动机和焦虑，大五人格特质位于技能集群上游。

Conclusion: 该方法为运动中心理特征的分析和运动员发展的决策支持提供了一个可解释的、数据驱动的框架。

Abstract: Psychological attributes rarely operate in isolation: coaches reason about
networks of related traits. We analyze a new dataset of 164 female volleyball
players from Italy's C and D leagues that combines standardized psychological
profiling with background information. To learn directed relationships among
mixed-type variables (ordinal questionnaire scores, categorical demographics,
continuous indicators), we introduce latent MMHC, a hybrid structure learner
that couples a latent Gaussian copula and a constraint-based skeleton with a
constrained score-based refinement to return a single DAG. We also study a
bootstrap-aggregated variant for stability. In simulations spanning sample
size, sparsity, and dimension, latent Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) attains
lower structural Hamming distance and higher edge recall than recent
copula-based learners while maintaining high specificity. Applied to
volleyball, the learned network organizes mental skills around goal setting and
self-confidence, with emotional arousal linking motivation and anxiety, and
locates Big-Five traits (notably neuroticism and extraversion) upstream of
skill clusters. Scenario analyses quantify how improvements in specific skills
propagate through the network to shift preparation, confidence, and
self-esteem. The approach provides an interpretable, data-driven framework for
profiling psychological traits in sport and for decision support in athlete
development.

Method: 提出了一种悲观双层优化程序，专门针对回归场景设计，不要求对手策略具有凸性或唯一性，能够捕捉对手的对抗性本质。

Result: 该方法扩展了悲观双层优化的应用范围，从分类问题延伸到回归问题，为回归模型的对抗性防御提供了新的理论框架。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了回归场景中对抗性防御的空白，提出的悲观双层优化方法有望提高回归模型在对抗性环境下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying
distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a
prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where
adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established
prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email
filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods
must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of
malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at
modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such
adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation
which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's
optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats
to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the
adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression
scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation
program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or
uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.

TL;DR: 提出了动态双级下采样（D³S）框架，通过样本级和token级的下采样策略，优先选择信息量最大的样本和token，提高策略优化的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无critic方法（如GRPO）收敛慢的问题，这些方法由于大量无信息样本和token稀释了关键学习信号。

Method: D³S框架包含两个层面：样本级选择优势方差最大的rollouts子集，token级选择优势幅度与策略熵乘积高的token。采用动态下采样调度防止过拟合。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama3.1上的实验表明，D³S集成到先进RL算法中实现了最先进的性能和泛化能力，同时需要更少的样本和token。

Conclusion: D³S框架通过动态双级下采样有效提高了策略优化的效率，在推理基准测试中取得了优异的结果。

Abstract: Critic-free methods like GRPO reduce memory demands by estimating advantages
from multiple rollouts but tend to converge slowly, as critical learning
signals are diluted by an abundance of uninformative samples and tokens. To
tackle this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling
(D$^3$S)} framework that prioritizes the most informative samples and tokens
across groups to improve the efficient of policy optimization. D$^3$S operates
along two levels: (1) the sample-level, which selects a subset of rollouts to
maximize advantage variance ($\text{Var}(A)$). We theoretically proven that
this selection is positively correlated with the upper bound of the policy
gradient norms, yielding higher policy gradients. (2) the token-level, which
prioritizes tokens with a high product of advantage magnitude and policy
entropy ($|A_{i,t}|\times H_{i,t}$), focusing updates on tokens where the
policy is both uncertain and impactful. Moreover, to prevent overfitting to
high-signal data, D$^3$S employs a dynamic down-sampling schedule inspired by
curriculum learning. This schedule starts with aggressive down-sampling to
accelerate early learning and gradually relaxes to promote robust
generalization. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1 demonstrate that
integrating D$^3$S into advanced RL algorithms achieves state-of-the-art
performance and generalization while requiring \textit{fewer} samples and
tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our code is added in the
supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的时间序列数据存在不规则采样和高缺失率的问题，临床变量根据工作流程和干预时间以不均匀间隔测量，这给建模带来了挑战。

Method: VITAL框架区分两种临床变量：频繁记录的生命体征（重编程到语言空间）和零星测量的实验室测试（使用代表性汇总值或可学习的[未测量]标记嵌入）。LLM通过显式编码捕获时间上下文并推理缺失值。

Result: 在PhysioNet基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，VITAL优于为不规则时间序列设计的最先进方法，并在高缺失率情况下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: VITAL能够有效处理真实世界临床场景中常见的高缺失率问题，为不规则采样的生理时间序列建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling
time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical
variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and
intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large
language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly
sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct
types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and
exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured
sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the
language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over
missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are
embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not
measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the
benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state
of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it
maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is
prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often
unavailable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的切片WoW加速方法依赖参数化元测度或高阶矩的存在，导致数值不稳定。需要一种更稳定、计算效率更高的方法来比较数据集或图像和形状的分布。

Method: 利用1维Wasserstein空间与L2([0,1])空间中分位数函数的等距性，引入任意Banach空间的通用切片Wasserstein框架。通过高斯过程参数化的无限维L2投影定义1维元测度的切片距离，结合欧几里得单位球上的经典积分得到DSW度量。

Result: 数值实验在数据集、形状和图像上验证了DSW作为WoW距离的可扩展替代方案的有效性，同时避免了不稳定的高阶矩问题并实现了计算节省。

Conclusion: DSW最小化在离散化元测度情况下等价于WoW最小化，但提供了更好的数值稳定性和计算效率，是处理元测度比较问题的实用工具。

Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on
arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The
resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but
computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images
and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures
or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an
alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein
space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this
purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary
Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a
sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional
$L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d
construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields
the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show
that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized
meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational
savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as
a scalable substitute for the WoW distance.

Result: 在离散图像自编码和对比语音表示学习等基准测试中，该方法实现了更可靠的码本利用和性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的正则化方法能够同时满足向量量化平滑的两个关键需求，相比现有方法具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Vector quantization, which discretizes a continuous vector space into a
finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in
modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a
fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient
backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing
the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of
codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the
codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers
should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2)
all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing
methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present
study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both
simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its
$K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks,
including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation
learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook
utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.

Motivation: 尽管半结构化(N:M)剪枝在权重剪枝中已广泛应用，但在激活剪枝领域仍未被充分探索，尽管它具有动态输入自适应压缩和减少I/O开销的潜力。

Result: 在多个LLM上，激活剪枝在相同稀疏度下比权重剪枝能更好地保持生成能力。16:32模式性能接近非结构化稀疏，但8:16模式在灵活性和硬件实现复杂度之间达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 研究结果为激活剪枝提供了有效的实用方法，并为未来硬件支持更灵活稀疏模式提供了动机。8:16稀疏模式是优越的候选方案。

Abstract: The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified
the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is
well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains
underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and
reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of
methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs,
we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of
generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity
levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and
pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require
minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's
standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par
with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between
flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16
pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical
methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support
more flexible sparsity patterns. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完全去中心化基础设施中，由于缺乏集中聚合，本地处理变得至关重要。传统静态权重分配方法无法充分利用服务器间的信息多样性。

Method: DYNAWEIGHT根据邻居服务器在本地数据集上的相对损失动态分配权重，优先考虑具有多样化信息的服务器。

Conclusion: DYNAWEIGHT作为一种兼容任何底层服务器级优化算法的聚合方案，具有广泛的适用性和集成潜力。

Abstract: In today's data-sensitive landscape, distributed learning emerges as a vital
tool, not only fortifying privacy measures but also streamlining computational
operations. This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized
infrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of
centralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to
information aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial
acceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication
and memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as
Metropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring
servers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it
favors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown)
equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$
corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal
groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to
uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is
orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its
inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the
neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and
efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms,
while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant
model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group
action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the
function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group
action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an
angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a
scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple.
This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs
while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including
polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix
prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our
model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and
efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.

TL;DR: 提出可逆图网络模拟器(R-GNS)，通过数学可逆设计统一正向和逆向模拟，在耗散流体系统中实现高效的目标导向轨迹生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决耗散系统中逆向推理的挑战，传统优化方法速度慢、不稳定且难以收敛，需要一种能同时处理正向和逆向模拟的统一框架。

Method: 基于残差可逆消息传递的数学可逆设计，使用共享参数耦合正向动力学与逆向推理，不试图逆转底层物理规律。

Result: 在三个耗散基准测试中，R-GNS仅用四分之一参数实现更高精度和一致性，逆向推理速度比优化基线快100倍以上，在目标导向任务中消除迭代优化。

Conclusion: 这是首个统一耗散流体系统正向和逆向模拟的可逆框架，能够生成复杂目标形状的物理一致轨迹。

Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a
fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based
simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference
remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are
irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail
to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator
(R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a
single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate
inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse
the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design
based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling
forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and
efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three
dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS
achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the
parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than
optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed
of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates
iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On
goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex
target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically
consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible
framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid
systems.

TL;DR: 论文证明当模型参数数量p超过数据维度d与样本数n的乘积时，可以从模型参数中重构整个训练数据集，揭示了数据重建的规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习模型的数据记忆现象，从数据重建角度分析模型参数与训练数据的关系，探索何时能够从模型参数中恢复原始训练数据。

Method: 在随机特征模型中，当p远大于dn时，特征空间中训练样本张成的子空间包含足够信息来识别输入空间中的个体样本。提出了一种从模型参数重构数据集的优化方法。

Result: 该方法在多种架构（随机特征、两层全连接网络和深度残差网络）上表现良好，验证了当p超过阈值dn时能够重建整个训练数据集。

Conclusion: 揭示了数据重建规律：当模型参数数量p超过数据维度d与样本数n的乘积时，可以从模型参数中完全恢复训练数据集。

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are known to memorize parts of the training
set. In machine learning theory, memorization is often framed as interpolation
or label fitting, and classical results show that this can be achieved when the
number of parameters $p$ in the model is larger than the number of training
samples $n$. In this work, we consider memorization from the perspective of
data reconstruction, demonstrating that this can be achieved when $p$ is larger
than $dn$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. More specifically, we
show that, in the random features model, when $p \gg dn$, the subspace spanned
by the training samples in feature space gives sufficient information to
identify the individual samples in input space. Our analysis suggests an
optimization method to reconstruct the dataset from the model parameters, and
we demonstrate that this method performs well on various architectures (random
features, two-layer fully-connected and deep residual networks). Our results
reveal a law of data reconstruction, according to which the entire training
dataset can be recovered as $p$ exceeds the threshold $dn$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SO(n)的单参数子群在机器人学、量子力学和分子结构分析等应用中至关重要，需要自动发现这些子群的方法。

Method: 利用斜对称矩阵的标准Jordan形式建立轨道规范形式，通过参数学习揭示底层单参数子群Hγ，并推导Hγ不变函数的标准化表示。

Result: 在双摆建模、转动惯量预测、顶夸克标记和不变多项式回归等任务中成功恢复了有意义的子群结构，并产生了可解释的对称感知表示。

Conclusion: 该框架有效发现了SO(n)的单参数子群，为对称性感知的表示学习提供了有力工具。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter
subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter
subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including
robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method
utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the
Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the
action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a
standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning
the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter
subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia
prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it
successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable,
symmetry-aware representations.

Motivation: 在现实世界的顺序决策问题中，需要在性能和公平性之间做出合适的权衡，但理想的权衡点难以预先确定，需要提供多种权衡选项供利益相关者选择。

Method: 提出了扩展的马尔可夫决策过程fMDP，显式编码个体和群体信息，并在此框架下形式化公平概念，计算随时间变化的公平性度量。

Result: 在招聘和欺诈检测两个场景中，该框架学习的策略在多个场景下更加公平，仅带来轻微的性能损失，且发现群体公平和个体公平不一定相互蕴含。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理顺序决策中的公平性问题，为不同问题设置提供了应用指南，证明了在保持性能的同时实现公平性的可行性。

Abstract: Equity in real-world sequential decision problems can be enforced using
fairness-aware methods. Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable
and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness
notions. As the desired performance-fairness trade-off is hard to specify a
priori, we propose a framework where multiple trade-offs can be explored.
Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the
obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in
selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an
extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals
and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of
sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes
fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with
distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed
while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent
transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly
distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair
across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward.
Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not
necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in
settings where both fairness types are desired. Finally, we provide guidelines
on how to apply this framework across different problem settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ASSESS框架，通过结合语义和结构信息来评估形式化语句相似度，使用TransTED相似度度量方法，并在EPLA基准测试中验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有形式化语句相似度评估方法存在局限性：基于字符串的方法只关注语法结构而忽略语义，基于证明的方法能验证语义等价但无法提供分级相似度评分且忽视结构差异。

Method: ASSESS框架将形式化语句转换为操作符树来捕获语法结构，然后使用TransTED相似度度量方法计算相似度得分，该方法通过变换增强了传统树编辑距离的语义感知能力。

Result: 在EPLA基准测试（包含524个专家标注的形式化语句对）上，TransTED相似度方法优于现有方法，实现了最先进的准确率和最高的Kappa系数。

Conclusion: ASSESS框架通过综合语义和结构信息，为形式化语句相似度评估提供了连续评分，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from
natural language into formal languages, has seen significant advancements, yet
the development of automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing
metrics for formal statement similarity often fail to balance semantic and
structural information. String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but
ignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic
equivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded
similarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we
introduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement
Similarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural
information to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first
transforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic
structure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED
(Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances
traditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through
transformations. For rigorous validation, we present EPLA (Evaluating
Provability and Likeness for Autoformalization), a new benchmark of 524
expert-annotated formal statement pairs derived from miniF2F and ProofNet, with
labels for both semantic provability and structural likeness. Experiments on
EPLA demonstrate that TransTED Similarity outperforms existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Kappa coefficient. The
benchmark, and implementation code will be made public soon.

Abstract: We introduce WIRE: Wavelet-Induced Rotary Encodings. WIRE extends Rotary
Position Encodings (RoPE), a popular algorithm in LLMs and ViTs, to
graph-structured data. We demonstrate that WIRE is more general than RoPE,
recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a
host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node
ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select
assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on
a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic
subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph
benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph
structure is important.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能记忆私人或敏感知识，现有遗忘方法存在"重新学习"风险，仅通过浅层对齐隐藏知识而非真正删除。

Method: 引入Ssiuu遗忘方法，使用归因引导的正则化来防止虚假负影响，忠实移除目标知识。

Result: 实验证明该方法能可靠擦除目标知识，在两种实际重训练场景下优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发鲁棒且忠实的遗忘方法对于语言模型安全部署的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models trained on web-scale data can memorize private or
sensitive knowledge, raising significant privacy risks. Although some
unlearning methods mitigate these risks, they remain vulnerable to "relearning"
during subsequent training, allowing a substantial portion of forgotten
knowledge to resurface. In this paper, we show that widely used unlearning
methods cause shallow alignment: instead of faithfully erasing target
knowledge, they generate spurious unlearning neurons that amplify negative
influence to hide it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Ssiuu, a new
class of unlearning methods that employs attribution-guided regularization to
prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge.
Experimental results confirm that our method reliably erases target knowledge
and outperforms strong baselines across two practical retraining scenarios: (1)
adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign attack using an
instruction-following benchmark. Our findings highlight the necessity of robust
and faithful unlearning methods for safe deployment of language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Spectral Uncertainty的新方法，利用量子信息理论中的冯·诺依曼熵来量化和分解LLMs中的不确定性，将总不确定性分为明确的偶然不确定性和认知不确定性成分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在多样化应用中的集成，获取可靠的预测不确定性度量变得至关重要。需要精确区分来自输入数据固有模糊性的偶然不确定性和仅来自模型局限性的认知不确定性，以有效处理每种不确定性来源。

Method: 利用量子信息理论中的冯·诺依曼熵，提供严格的理论基础来分离总不确定性为不同的偶然和认知成分。该方法结合了语义相似性的细粒度表示，能够在模型响应中对各种语义解释进行细致区分。

Result: 实证评估表明，Spectral Uncertainty在估计各种模型和基准数据集上的偶然不确定性和总不确定性方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: Spectral Uncertainty为LLMs中的不确定性量化和分解提供了一种新颖且有效的方法，在理论和实证上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse
applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has
become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric
uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic
uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to
effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce
Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing
uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum
information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical
foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and
epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach
incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling
nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model
responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total
uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such
as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data
in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP,
still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due
to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel
correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series
framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization
for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical
representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification,
we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in
routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is
operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and
encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss
to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive
experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of PatchMoE.

Conclusion: 扩散自编码器为无线语义通信提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够更好地学习语义到真实分布的映射，解决了传统方法的扩展性限制，并在多用户场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) systems aim to learn the mapping from
low-dimensional semantics to high-dimensional ground-truth. While this is more
akin to a "domain translation" problem, existing frameworks typically emphasize
on channel-adaptive neural encoding-decoding schemes, lacking full exploration
of signal distribution. Moreover, such methods so far have employed
autoencoder-based architectures, where the encoding is tightly coupled to a
matched decoder, causing scalability issues in practice. To address these gaps,
diffusion autoencoder models are proposed for wireless SemCom. The goal is to
learn a "semantic-to-clean" mapping, from the semantic space to the
ground-truth probability distribution. A neural encoder at semantic transmitter
extracts the high-level semantics, and a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at
the semantic receiver exploits the source distribution for signal-space
denoising, while the received semantic latents are incorporated as the
conditioning input to "steer" the decoding process towards the semantics
intended by the transmitter. It is analytically proved that the proposed
decoder model is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Furthermore,
extensive simulations over CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets are provided along with
design insights, highlighting the performance compared to legacy autoencoders
and variational autoencoders (VAE). Simulations are further extended to the
multi-user SemCom, identifying the dominating factors in a more realistic
setup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超图划分算法容易陷入局部最优，划分质量有待提升，特别是在处理不同规模数据和加权顶点集时表现不足。

Method: 使用多目标非凸约束松弛模型和加速近端梯度算法生成顶点特征；针对不同数据规模采用两种MST策略：小规模数据使用Prim算法构建MST后剪枝聚类，大规模数据选择代表性节点构建小MST并分配剩余节点；引入贪心迁移、交换和递归MST聚类等细化策略。

Result: 在公开基准测试集上，相比KaHyPar在2、3、4路划分中平均减少2%-5%的割边大小，特定实例提升达35%；在加权顶点集上优于KaHyPar、hMetis、Mt-KaHyPar和K-SpecPart等先进划分器；细化策略可将hMetis划分结果提升达16%。

Conclusion: 该算法在超图划分质量上具有显著优势，特别是在加权顶点集上表现突出，验证了其竞争力和性能权衡特征。

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient hypergraph partitioning framework based on a
novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model. A modified
accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse
$k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition
quality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for
small-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree
followed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of
representative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining
nodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve
partitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration,
swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.
  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\%--5\% on average
compared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to
35\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis,
Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and
competitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis
partitions by up to 16\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance
methodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's
competitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: Aurora通过有效整合多模态领域知识，显著提升了时间序列预测的跨域泛化能力，支持零样本推理，在各种场景下都取得了优异表现。

Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting
because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due
to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal
time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models.
Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts,
the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the
performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not
support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we
introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports
multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain
Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key
domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus
possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization,
encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as
guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to
inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding
phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and
prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow
Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on
well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS,
demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both
unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

TL;DR: HEAPr是一种新颖的MoE模型剪枝算法，通过将专家分解为原子专家进行细粒度剪枝，利用二阶信息评估重要性，显著降低内存需求并保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构虽然性能优异，但参数数量庞大导致内存需求过高，限制了实际部署。现有的专家级剪枝方法粒度太粗，会导致显著的精度下降。

Method: 将专家分解为更小的原子专家，利用类似OBS理论的二阶信息来评估原子专家重要性。通过将专家参数的二阶信息转换为原子专家参数，再简化为原子专家输出的二阶信息，将空间复杂度从O(d^4)降低到O(d^2)。仅需在小校准集上进行两次前向传播和一次反向传播。

Result: 在DeepSeek MoE和Qwen MoE等模型上的实验表明，HEAPr在广泛的压缩比和基准测试中优于现有专家级剪枝方法。在20%~25%的压缩比下实现几乎无损压缩，同时减少近20%的FLOPs。

Conclusion: HEAPr提供了一种高效精确的MoE模型剪枝方法，通过原子专家级别的细粒度剪枝，在保持性能的同时显著降低内存需求，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs)
deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense
LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory
requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods
primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to
substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel
pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic
experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure
the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information
based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address
the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information,
HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the
second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert
parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic
expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where
d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward
passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the
importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including
DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing
expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and
benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at
compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs
nearly by 20%. The code can be found at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的溶剂表示方案SoDaDE，使用小型Transformer模型和溶剂属性数据集创建溶剂指纹，在预测产率任务中优于现有表示方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化学表示方法通常基于通用数据集训练，缺乏针对溶剂的物理上下文信息。有害溶剂使用是化工行业主要气候问题，绿色溶剂替代研究需求迫切

Method: 开发SoDaDE溶剂数据驱动嵌入，使用小型Transformer模型和溶剂属性数据集生成溶剂指纹表示

Result: 在最近发布的产率预测数据集上，SoDaDE优于之前的表示方法

Conclusion: 证明即使使用小数据集也能创建数据驱动的指纹，并建立了可应用于其他领域的工作流程

Abstract: Computational representations have become crucial in unlocking the recent
growth of machine learning algorithms for chemistry. Initially hand-designed,
machine learning has shown that meaningful representations can be learnt from
data. Chemical datasets are limited and so the representations learnt from data
are generic, being trained on broad datasets which contain shallow information
on many different molecule types. For example, generic fingerprints lack
physical context specific to solvents. However, the use of harmful solvents is
a leading climate-related issue in the chemical industry, and there is a surge
of interest in green solvent replacement. To empower this research, we propose
a new solvent representation scheme by developing Solvent Data Driven
Embeddings (SoDaDE). SoDaDE uses a small transformer model and solvent property
dataset to create a fingerprint for solvents. To showcase their effectiveness,
we use SoDaDE to predict yields on a recently published dataset, outperforming
previous representations. We demonstrate through this paper that data-driven
fingerprints can be made with small datasets and set-up a workflow that can be
explored for other applications.

TL;DR: 提出了APB方法，通过插入轻量级线性层实现参数高效微调，在任务不匹配情况下提升样本效率并适应分布外任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习需要大量交互数据，现有方法在训练和部署任务不匹配时性能下降，特别是在分布外设置下表现不佳

Method: APB元迁移强化学习方法，在共享骨干网络前后插入轻量级线性层，实现参数高效微调并保留先验知识

Result: APB相比标准RL提高了样本效率，能够适应分布外任务，而现有元RL基线通常失败

Conclusion: APB方法有效解决了任务不匹配问题，特别是在分布外设置下表现出色

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results across domains,
yet learning an optimal policy typically requires extensive interaction data,
limiting practical deployment. A common remedy is to leverage priors, such as
pre-collected datasets or reference policies, but their utility degrades under
task mismatch between training and deployment. While prior work has sought to
address this mismatch, it has largely been restricted to in-distribution
settings. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB),
a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear layers before and
after a shared backbone, thereby enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) while preserving prior knowledge during adaptation. Our results show
that APB improves sample efficiency over standard RL and adapts to
out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically
fail.

TL;DR: 提出渐进式权重加载(PWL)方法，通过先部署轻量学生模型，然后逐步替换为预训练教师模型的层，在保持初始推理速度的同时逐步提升精度至教师模型水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型日益庞大复杂，导致内存消耗和计算需求增加，模型加载时间和初始推理延迟显著提升，在移动端和延迟敏感环境中频繁加载卸载模型严重影响用户体验。

Method: PWL技术首先部署轻量学生模型，然后增量替换其层为预训练教师模型的层。引入训练方法对齐学生和教师层的中间特征表示，同时提升学生模型的整体输出性能。

Result: 在VGG、ResNet和ViT架构上的实验表明，PWL训练的模型保持竞争力的蒸馏性能，随着教师层加载逐步提升精度，最终达到完整教师模型的准确率，且不损害初始推理速度。

Conclusion: PWL特别适合动态、资源受限的部署场景，在响应性和性能都至关重要的环境中提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in
higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model
loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant
challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model
loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience.
While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large
teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced
performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading
(PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying
a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those
of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we
introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature
representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the
overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG,
ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain
competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher
layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without
compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for
dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and
performance are critical.

TL;DR: 论文研究了深度持续学习中神经网络失去可塑性的原因，发现这是由新任务初始化时的Hessian谱崩溃导致的，并提出通过保持高有效特征秩和L2正则化来维持网络可塑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络在持续学习中为何会失去可塑性，无法学习新任务而需要重新初始化参数的问题。

Method: 引入τ-可训练性概念，基于Hessian的Kronecker分解近似，提出两种正则化增强方法：保持高有效特征秩和应用L2惩罚。

Result: 在持续监督学习和强化学习任务上的实验证实，结合这两种正则化器能有效保持网络的可塑性。

Conclusion: Hessian谱崩溃是导致神经网络失去可塑性的关键原因，通过针对性的正则化方法可以有效维持网络的学习能力。

Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from \emph{loss of plasticity}
in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing
parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse
at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and
gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition
for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and
show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this
framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker
factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization
enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying $L2$
penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks
confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

Motivation: 生存分析在临床研究中至关重要，但生存数据常因删失而存在不完整的事件信息。现有方法难以同时忠实再现事件时间分布和删失机制，这对临床研究的合成数据生成提出了独特挑战。

Method: 提出SurvDiff扩散模型，使用生存定制的损失函数联合生成混合类型协变量、事件时间和右删失数据，该损失函数编码时间到事件结构并直接优化下游生存任务。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SurvDiff在分布保真度和下游评估指标方面持续优于最先进的生成基线方法。

Conclusion: SurvDiff是首个专门为生成合成生存数据设计的扩散模型，能够真实再现事件时间分布并保持删失机制，为临床研究提供了高质量的合成数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling
time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death.
Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event
information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges
for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to
faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring
mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model
specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis.
SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly
generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a
survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure
and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that
SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves
the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \survdiff
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both
distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple
medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first diffusion
model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态世界模型在面对新颖或罕见配置时表现不佳，需要研究能够适应环境动态变化的自适应世界模型。

Method: 形式化了上下文环境学习，识别两种核心机制(环境识别和环境学习)，推导误差上界，并通过实证验证ICL机制的存在及影响因素。

Result: 实证确认世界模型中存在不同的ICL机制，发现数据分布和模型架构以符合理论的方式影响ICL，长上下文和多样化环境是ICEL出现的关键因素。

Conclusion: 研究展示了自适应世界模型的潜力，揭示了ICEL出现的关键因素，特别是长上下文和多样化环境的必要性。

Abstract: The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological
neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet
prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted
with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment
learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth
and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1)
we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core
mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive
error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge;
and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world
model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture
affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the
potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind
the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse
environments.

TL;DR: 提出随机激活策略，在LLM前馈层中随机选择SILU或RELU非线性函数，解决RELU的梯度流问题，并在预训练和生成任务中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RELU激活函数在负输入区域梯度为零的优化问题，同时探索在生成任务中增加文本多样性的方法。

Method: 使用伯努利分布随机选择SILU或RELU激活函数，在预训练阶段采用随机激活，推理时固定为RELU以获得稀疏性和速度提升。

Result: 预训练时使用随机激活后微调RELU比直接训练RELU效果更好，推理速度显著提升；生成任务中性能接近最佳确定性方法SILU+温度缩放。

Conclusion: 随机激活策略有效解决了RELU的优化问题，提供了控制文本多样性的新方法，在效率和性能间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects
between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large
language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a
Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated
with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the
gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:
  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model
with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors.
This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in
the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from
scratch with the RELU activation function.
  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs
reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic
non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an
alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase
the diversity of the generated text.

Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在多个领域取得经验成功，但对神经特征表示的理解仍不完整。本文旨在通过离散几何来研究神经特征几何。

Method: 使用编码局部相似性结构的几何图来近似输入数据流形，提供训练过程中这些图演化的理论结果，并通过在合成和真实数据集上训练的20,000多个前馈神经网络进行实验验证。

Result: 观察到类可分性的出现对应于相关图表示中社区结构的出现，这与离散Ricci流动力学相关。基于这些见解，提出了通过比较离散Ricci流动力学来局部评估几何变换的新框架。

Conclusion: 研究结果提出了实用的设计原则，包括几何信息的早停启发式和网络深度选择标准。

Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric
transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical
success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is
still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through
the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically
unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local
similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these
graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role
in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we
discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on
these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to
Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000
feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both
synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class
separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the
associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci
flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for
locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete
Ricci flow dynamics. Our results suggest practical design principles, including
a geometry-informed early-stopping heuristic and a criterion for selecting
network depth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本LLMs的思维链往往不忠实，但音频语言模型中的忠实性问题尚未探索，这对安全敏感应用至关重要。

Method: 应用多种针对性干预（转述、填充词注入、提前回答、引入错误）在两个推理数据集SAKURA和MMAR上测试LALMs。

Result: 实验表明LALMs生成的CoT总体上能忠实反映其底层决策过程。

Conclusion: 与文本LLMs不同，LALMs产生的思维链具有较高的忠实性，这对安全敏感应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations
accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable
explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often
unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models
(LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications.
Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract
relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we
investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying
targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early
answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets:
SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across
several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally
produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.

Conclusion: 桶聚合与硬门控专家方法能够在严格隐私保护下实现稳定的联邦训练，同时提高多模态钓鱼检测的可用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We present a federated, multi-modal phishing website detector that supports
URL, HTML, and IMAGE inputs without binding clients to a fixed modality at
inference: any client can invoke any modality head trained elsewhere.
Methodologically, we propose role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx,
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM. We drop learnable routing and use
hard gating (selecting the IMAGE/HTML/URL expert by sample modality), enabling
separate aggregation of modality-specific parameters to isolate cross-embedding
conflicts and stabilize convergence. On TR-OP, the Fusion head reaches Acc
97.5% with FPR 2.4% across two data types; on the image subset (ablation) it
attains Acc 95.5% with FPR 5.9%. For text, we use GraphCodeBERT for URLs and an
early three-way embedding for raw, noisy HTML. On WebPhish (HTML) we obtain Acc
96.5% / FPR 1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML) we obtain Acc 95.1% / FPR 4.6%. Results
indicate that bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable
federated training under strict privacy, while improving the usability and
flexibility of multi-modal phishing detection.

Abstract: Effective credit risk management is fundamental to financial decision-making,
necessitating robust models for default probability prediction and financial
entity classification. Traditional machine learning approaches face significant
challenges when confronted with high-dimensional data, limited
interpretability, rare event detection, and multi-class imbalance problems in
risk assessment. This research proposes a comprehensive meta-learning framework
that synthesizes multiple complementary models: supervised learning algorithms,
including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree;
unsupervised methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors; deep learning architectures
like Multilayer Perceptron; alongside LASSO regularization for feature
selection and dimensionality reduction; and Error-Correcting Output Codes as a
meta-classifier for handling imbalanced multi-class problems. We implement
Permutation Feature Importance analysis for each prediction class across all
constituent models to enhance model transparency. Our framework aims to
optimize predictive performance while providing a more holistic approach to
credit risk assessment. This research contributes to the development of more
accurate and reliable computational models for strategic financial decision
support by addressing three fundamental challenges in credit risk modeling. The
empirical validation of our approach involves an analysis of the Corporate
Credit Ratings dataset with credit ratings for 2,029 publicly listed US
companies. Results demonstrate that our meta-learning framework significantly
enhances the accuracy of financial entity classification regarding credit
rating migrations (upgrades and downgrades) and default probability estimation.

Conclusion: 可微L0正则化能有效降低可解释模型的复杂度，同时保持性能，为构建高性能且可解释的AI系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely used in practical applications of AI,
however, their inner structure and complexity made them generally not easily
interpretable. Model transparency and interpretability are key requirements for
multiple scenarios where high performance is not enough to adopt the proposed
solution. In this work, a differentiable approximation of $L_0$ regularization
is adapted into a logic-based neural network, the Multi-layer Logical
Perceptron (MLLP), to study its efficacy in reducing the complexity of its
discrete interpretable version, the Concept Rule Set (CRS), while retaining its
performance. The results are compared to alternative heuristics like Random
Binarization of the network weights, to determine if better results can be
achieved when using a less-noisy technique that sparsifies the network based on
the loss function instead of a random distribution. The trade-off between the
CRS complexity and its performance is discussed.

TL;DR: SpinGPT是首个针对三人在线扑克游戏Spin & Go的LLM模型，通过两阶段训练（监督微调和强化学习），在78%的决策中与求解器一致，并在与Slumbot的对战中取得13.4 BB/100的胜率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFR算法在多玩家游戏中计算复杂度指数级增长，且纳什均衡在三玩家及以上游戏中无法保证不输结果，限制了在流行锦标赛格式中的应用。受LLM在棋类和外交游戏中成功的启发，开发专门针对多玩家不完全信息游戏的LLM。

Method: 两阶段训练：1）在32万手高注额专家决策上进行监督微调；2）在27万手求解器生成的手牌上进行强化学习。使用简单的深筹码启发式方法。

Result: 在78%的决策中与求解器一致（容忍准确率）。在3万手牌中对战Slumbot取得13.4 ± 12.9 BB/100的胜率（95%置信区间）。

Conclusion: LLM可能是处理多玩家不完全信息游戏（如扑克）的新方法，展示了在复杂多玩家游戏中的潜力。

Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have
enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players
in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats.
However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of
players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash
equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along
with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most
popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language
Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored
to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in
two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions;
(2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show
that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant
accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100
versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest
that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information

Motivation: 利率下降和经济稳定增加了死亡率预测的重要性，特别是在保险和养老金市场。多步预测对公共卫生、人口规划和保险风险评估至关重要，但在数据有限时面临挑战。

Method: 使用混合系统结合统计和机器学习模型来处理线性和非线性模式，评估了三种多步预测方法（递归、直接和多输入多输出）以及多种ML模型。

Result: 基于12个数据集和21个模型的结果表明，多步预测方法和ML模型的选择对提高性能至关重要。

Conclusion: ARIMA-LSTM混合模型采用递归方法在大多数情况下优于其他模型，证明了混合系统在死亡率预测中的有效性。

Abstract: The decline in interest rates and economic stabilization has heightened the
importance of accurate mortality rate forecasting, particularly in insurance
and pension markets. Multi-step-ahead predictions are crucial for public
health, demographic planning, and insurance risk assessments; however, they
face challenges when data are limited. Hybrid systems that combine statistical
and Machine Learning (ML) models offer a promising solution for handling both
linear and nonlinear patterns. This study evaluated the impact of different
multi-step forecasting approaches (Recursive, Direct, and Multi-Input
Multi-Output) and ML models on the accuracy of hybrid systems. Results from 12
datasets and 21 models show that the selection of both the multi-step approach
and the ML model is essential for improving performance, with the ARIMA-LSTM
hybrid using a recursive approach outperforming other models in most cases.

TL;DR: 提出ReLAM框架，通过关键点提取和预测模型自动生成密集结构化奖励，解决视觉强化学习中奖励设计的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界视觉环境中难以获得精确的位置信息，传统的基于距离的奖励设计方法在视觉强化学习中存在局限性。

Method: 使用关键点提取空间距离信息，学习预测模型作为规划器提出中间子目标，在分层强化学习框架下训练目标条件策略。

Result: 在复杂长视野操作任务上的实验表明，ReLAM显著加速学习过程并优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: ReLAM通过自动生成结构化奖励，有效解决了视觉强化学习中奖励设计的挑战，提高了学习效率和性能。

Abstract: Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning
(RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are
conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However,
such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual
settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a
method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted
from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation
Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured
rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an
anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate
keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a
structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric
objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is
provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound.
Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that
ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: MoveFM-R是一个新颖的移动性基础模型框架，通过结合语言驱动的语义推理能力来解决现有模型在数据规模和语义理解方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动性基础模型在数据规模和语义理解方面存在天花板，而大语言模型虽然具有强大的语义推理能力，但缺乏对时空统计的固有理解。

Method: 提出三个核心创新：语义增强的位置编码来弥合地理-语言差距、渐进式课程来对齐LLM推理与移动模式、交互式自反机制进行条件轨迹生成。

Result: 大量实验表明MoveFM-R显著优于现有的MFM和LLM基线模型，在零样本设置下表现出强大的泛化能力，并能从自然语言指令生成真实轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过将MFM的统计能力与LLM的深度语义理解相结合，MoveFM-R开创了一个更全面、可解释和强大的人类移动性建模新范式。

Abstract: Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human
movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and
semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful
semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal
statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories.
To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the
full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven
semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary
mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language
tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the
semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a
semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a
progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and
an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms
existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization
in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from
natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs
with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm
that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of
human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 格子玻尔兹曼方程虽然能有效捕捉复杂流动行为，但数值求解计算成本高，受限于碰撞核的严格时间步长限制。

Method: 结合LBE的内在矩匹配约束和全局等变性，构建物理信息神经算子框架，无需显式求解碰撞核，实现离散化不变性和动力学超分辨率。

Conclusion: 为动力学系统建模开辟了新的数据驱动途径，具有广泛适用性和计算效率优势。

Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a
powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the
evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its
success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to
strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce
a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables
prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration,
effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We
incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global
equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the
complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is
discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to
generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is
agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it
naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the
governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow
scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble
adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图提示学习方法存在两个关键问题：缺乏对底层机制的共识（不同提示策略在不同模型空间干预），以及有限的场景适应性（尤其在数据分布变化时）。

Method: 提出UniPrompt方法，通过理论分析发现表示级提示本质上是微调下游分类器，因此专注于释放预训练模型能力，同时保持输入图结构不变。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniPrompt能有效与各种预训练模型集成，在域内和跨域场景中都取得强劲性能。

Conclusion: 图提示学习应专注于释放预训练模型能力，让分类器适应下游场景，UniPrompt为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges
graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency
and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks.
Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their
effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two
critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite
current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts
interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying
spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and
representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods
fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data
distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these
issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that
representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple
downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on
unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier adapts to
downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL
method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of
pretrained models while preserving the structure of the input graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various
pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and
cross-domain scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种内存和计算效率高的低通信分布式训练方法，通过限制反向传播只更新部分参数来减少峰值内存使用和训练FLOPs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过多次本地更新减少通信，但其效率仍有提升空间。本文旨在进一步降低分布式训练的内存和计算开销。

Method: 每个节点在本地步骤中只更新固定的参数子集，其余参数保持冻结，同时保持完整的正向传播以避免跨节点激活交换。

Result: 在32个节点上训练13亿参数语言模型的实验表明，该方法在相同token和带宽预算下达到了与现有低通信方法相当的困惑度，同时减少了训练FLOPs和峰值内存。

Conclusion: 限制反向传播的参数更新范围是提高分布式训练效率的有效策略，能在保持模型性能的同时显著降低资源消耗。

Abstract: We introduce a memory- and compute-efficient method for low-communication
distributed training. Existing methods reduce communication by performing
multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We
demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting
backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only
a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This
constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a
full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node
activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained
across $32$ nodes show that our method matches the perplexity of prior
low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets while
reducing training FLOPs and peak memory.

TL;DR: 本文研究了博弈学习中时间延迟反馈的问题，提出了加权乐观跟随正则化领导者算法(WOFTRL)，通过调整乐观权重来抵消时间延迟的影响，在乐观权重超过时间延迟时能实现常数遗憾和最佳迭代收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 博弈学习中多个智能体独立学习策略会产生优化差异，通常使用乐观预测来克服这种差异，但过去奖励的时间延迟观测会阻碍预测效果，即使单步延迟也会恶化算法性能。

Method: 提出了加权OFTRL算法，将OFTRL中下一个奖励的预测向量加权n倍，通过乐观权重来抵消时间延迟的影响。

Result: 当乐观权重超过时间延迟时，WOFTRL在一般和正规形式博弈中能实现常数遗憾(O(1)-regret)，在多矩阵零和博弈中策略能收敛到纳什均衡子序列(最佳迭代收敛)。

Conclusion: 加权乐观跟随正则化领导者算法能有效解决博弈学习中的时间延迟问题，理论结果得到了实验验证和支持。

Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in
learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents
independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often
emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the
future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the
past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that
even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of
regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where
the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We
further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time
delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our
WOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant
($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge
to the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in
poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and
strengthened by our experiments.

Motivation: 现有持久同调计算方法在处理大规模欧几里得点云数据时面临计算复杂度高的问题，特别是Vietoris-Rips复形的指数增长限制了其应用。

Method: 引入Flood复形，通过Delaunay三角剖分和洪水覆盖过程构建复形，结合Alpha复形和Witness复形的优点，支持GPU并行化。

Result: 在3D点云数据上实现了数百万点二维持久同调计算，在真实和合成数据的物体分类任务中表现优于其他基于持久同调的方法和点云神经网络。

Conclusion: Flood复形为大规模点云数据的拓扑分析提供了高效解决方案，特别适用于几何或拓扑复杂的对象分析。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing persistent homology (PH) for large-scale
Euclidean point cloud data, aimed at downstream machine learning tasks, where
the exponential growth of the most widely-used Vietoris-Rips complex imposes
serious computational limitations. Although more scalable alternatives such as
the Alpha complex or sparse Rips approximations exist, they often still result
in a prohibitively large number of simplices. This poses challenges in the
complex construction and in the subsequent PH computation, prohibiting their
use on large-scale point clouds. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the
Flood complex, inspired by the advantages of the Alpha and Witness complex
constructions. Informally, at a given filtration value $r\geq 0$, the Flood
complex contains all simplices from a Delaunay triangulation of a small subset
of the point cloud $X$ that are fully covered by balls of radius $r$ emanating
from $X$, a process we call flooding. Our construction allows for efficient PH
computation, possesses several desirable theoretical properties, and is
amenable to GPU parallelization. Scaling experiments on 3D point cloud data
show that we can compute PH of up to dimension 2 on several millions of points.
Importantly, when evaluating object classification performance on real-world
and synthetic data, we provide evidence that this scaling capability is needed,
especially if objects are geometrically or topologically complex, yielding
performance superior to other PH-based methods and neural networks for point
cloud data.

Motivation: 由于缺乏原则性的模型复杂度度量，将MDL原则应用于Transformer等神经网络具有挑战性。本文旨在为神经网络提供具有强渐近保证的描述长度目标理论框架。

Method: 基于Kolmogorov复杂度理论建立渐近最优描述长度目标，证明其在Transformer中存在，构建基于自适应高斯混合先验的可微分变分目标。

Result: 理论证明渐近最优目标可实现最优压缩，实验显示变分目标能选择低复杂度解并具有强泛化能力，但标准优化器难以从随机初始化找到此类解。

Conclusion: 通过提供具有强渐近保证的描述长度目标理论框架，为训练实现更好压缩和泛化的神经网络指明了潜在路径。

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for
applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural
networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled,
universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical
notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an
objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive
constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that
asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new
demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such
objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a
variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our
empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a
low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but
standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,
highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a
theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong
asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural
networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM)蒸馏框架，用于加速静电生成模型PFGM++的采样过程，通过将蒸馏问题转化为学习生成器使其诱导的静电场与教师模型匹配的逆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFGM++等静电生成模型虽然取得了最先进的图像合成性能，但依赖于昂贵的ODE模拟进行采样，计算成本高昂。

Method: 将蒸馏重新表述为逆问题：学习一个生成器，使其诱导的静电场与教师模型匹配，并推导出可处理的训练目标。

Result: IPFM产生的蒸馏生成器仅需少量函数评估即可达到接近甚至优于教师模型的样本质量，且有限D值的蒸馏收敛速度比D→∞（扩散模型）极限更快。

Conclusion: IPFM是有效的静电生成模型蒸馏框架，能够显著加速采样过程，同时保持样本质量，且有限D值的模型具有更优的优化和采样特性。

Abstract: Electrostatic generative models such as PFGM++ have recently emerged as a
powerful framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image synthesis.
PFGM++ operates in an extended data space with auxiliary dimensionality $D$,
recovering the diffusion model framework as $D\to\infty$, while yielding
superior empirical results for finite $D$. Like diffusion models, PFGM++ relies
on expensive ODE simulations to generate samples, making it computationally
costly. To address this, we propose Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a
novel distillation framework that accelerates electrostatic generative models
across all values of $D$. Our IPFM reformulates distillation as an inverse
problem: learning a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of
the teacher. We derive a tractable training objective for this problem and show
that, as $D \to \infty$, our IPFM closely recovers Score Identity Distillation
(SiD), a recent method for distilling diffusion models. Empirically, our IPFM
produces distilled generators that achieve near-teacher or even superior sample
quality using only a few function evaluations. Moreover, we observe that
distillation converges faster for finite $D$ than in the $D \to \infty$
(diffusion) limit, which is consistent with prior findings that finite-$D$
PFGM++ models exhibit more favorable optimization and sampling properties.

Motivation: 当前物理信息图神经网络(PIGNNs)在精度上仍需改进，特别是在推理时物理损失失效，这阻碍了其在电力系统运行中的实际应用。

Method: 提出PIGNN-Attn-LS方法：1）边缘感知注意力机制，通过每边偏置显式编码线路物理特性；2）基于回溯线搜索的全局化校正算子，在推理时恢复有效的下降准则。

Result: 在4-32总线电网测试中，电压测试RMSE为0.00033 p.u.，角度为0.08°，比PIGNN-MLP基线分别提升99.5%和87.1%。在4-1024总线电网上，批量推理速度比牛顿-拉夫逊法快2-5倍。

Conclusion: PIGNN-Attn-LS通过结合注意力机制和全局化校正，显著提升了PIGNNs在AC潮流计算中的精度和效率，为电力系统运行提供了可靠的快速求解器。

Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC
power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers,
especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current
PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the
physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption.
We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism
that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's
anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction
operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training
and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR
used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of
4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage
and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and
87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$
faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.

Motivation: 现有的全维优化方法暴露神经网络的中间变量和约束给优化求解器，导致计算效率低下。需要一种更高效的优化方法来处理神经网络相关的优化问题。

Conclusion: 降维公式通过将神经网络视为灰盒，在保持优化性能的同时显著提高了计算效率，特别适用于需要频繁评估神经网络输出和导数的优化问题。

Abstract: We propose a reduced-space formulation for optimizing over trained neural
networks where the network's outputs and derivatives are evaluated on a GPU. To
do this, we treat the neural network as a "gray box" where intermediate
variables and constraints are not exposed to the optimization solver. Compared
to the full-space formulation, in which intermediate variables and constraints
are exposed to the optimization solver, the reduced-space formulation leads to
faster solves and fewer iterations in an interior point method. We demonstrate
the benefits of this method on two optimization problems: Adversarial
generation for a classifier trained on MNIST images and security-constrained
optimal power flow with transient feasibility enforced using a neural network
surrogate.

Motivation: 高阶数值方法虽然能提升Transformer在NLP和CV任务中的性能，但会带来计算开销增加的问题。传统效率优化技术（如蒸馏）可能损害这些模型的性能。

Method: 1. 提出IIET，使用迭代隐式欧拉方法简化高阶方法；2. 引入IIAD蒸馏方法，通过灵活阈值平衡性能-效率权衡。

Result: 在lm-evaluation-harness上，IIET比普通Transformer平均准确率提升2.65%，比PCformer提升0.8%。高效变体E-IIET减少55%推理开销，同时保留99.4%原始任务准确率。

Conclusion: IIET在保持高性能的同时实现了有效的模型压缩，IIAD方法提供了灵活的性能-效率平衡机制。

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like
NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased
computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency
techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of
these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based
Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit
\textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies
high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This
simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates
model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we
introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD
allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On
lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla
Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET,
significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the

Conclusion: 3D信息增强的分子表示能够有效迁移到新的化学领域，证明了3D结构信息在分子表示学习中的重要性。

Abstract: High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction
and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While
self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many
existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex
generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable
3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce
C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework
that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns
molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their
complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as
modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate
both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or
expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich
3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on
MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal
self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and
molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to
new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular

TL;DR: 该论文将高斯过程回归与动态模态分解相结合，解决了基于核的Koopman算子方法中的稀疏性和超参数优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Koopman算子作为非线性动力系统的线性表示，在多个科学领域受到关注。但基于核的Koopman算法存在两个普遍问题：计算复杂度高且需要稀疏化处理，以及超参数优化和字典学习的挑战。

Method: 将高斯过程回归与动态模态分解相结合，利用高斯过程方法来缓解核基Koopman算法的计算负担，并提高对传感器噪声的鲁棒性。

Result: 该方法不仅降低了计算需求，还展示了对传感器噪声的更好抵抗能力，同时改进了超参数优化和字典学习过程。

Conclusion: 主要贡献在于统一了高斯过程回归和动态模态分解，为基于核的Koopman算子方法提供了更高效和鲁棒的实现方案。

Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical
system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently,
Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular
in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into
Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two
pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being
sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to
become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be
reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The
second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to
adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of
this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode
decomposition.

TL;DR: 提出了OFMU，一种基于惩罚的双层优化框架，用于机器遗忘，通过分层结构优先处理遗忘目标，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 采用惩罚性双层优化框架，内层最大化步骤通过相似性感知惩罚强制遗忘，外层最小化步骤恢复模型效用，并开发了具有收敛保证的两循环算法。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，OFMU在遗忘效果和保留效用方面始终优于现有遗忘方法，实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: OFMU通过明确的优化层次结构和梯度解相关机制，有效解决了机器遗忘中的多目标冲突问题，提供了可扩展且理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require
the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted
materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure
regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine
unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while
maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is
to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a
single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention
losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in
unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting
gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a
penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes
forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our
method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a
similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and
retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step.
To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable
convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further
provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our
approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model
utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and
language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing
unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.

Abstract: We present a machine learning pipeline for biomarker discovery in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), integrating eight publicly available microarray datasets from
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). After robust preprocessing we
trained an XGBoost classifier optimized via Bayesian search. SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) were used to identify key features for model prediction,
indicating thus possible biomarkers. These were compared with genes identified
through classical Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). Our comparison
revealed both overlapping and unique biomarkers between SHAP and DEA,
suggesting complementary strengths. Enrichment analysis confirmed the
biological relevance of SHAP-selected genes, linking them to pathways such as
sphingolipid signaling, Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation, and Epstein-Barr
virus infection all known to be associated with MS. This study highlights the
value of combining explainable AI (xAI) with traditional statistical methods to
gain deeper insights into disease mechanism.

Abstract: Constrained optimization is a powerful framework for enforcing requirements
on neural networks. These constrained deep learning problems are typically
solved using first-order methods on their min-max Lagrangian formulation, but
such approaches often suffer from oscillations and can fail to find all local
solutions. While the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) addresses these issues,
practitioners often favor dual optimistic ascent schemes (PI control) on the
standard Lagrangian, which perform well empirically but lack formal guarantees.
In this paper, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between these
approaches: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient
descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This finding allows us to transfer
the robust theoretical guarantees of the ALM to the dual optimistic setting,
proving it converges linearly to all local solutions. Furthermore, the
equivalence provides principled guidance for tuning the optimism
hyper-parameter. Our work closes a critical gap between the empirical success
of dual optimistic methods and their theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning
(DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising
user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently
assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however,
not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in
their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical
heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can
lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these
challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to
encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these
challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates
efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the
context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully
heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an
incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated
learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated
learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the
performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of
complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model
architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID
scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease
communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and
model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and
baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH
achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

Conclusion: 联合建模连续时空数据和同步离散事件对于构建现实且可控的交互系统生成模型具有关键意义。

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate
processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact
synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion
framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating
continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate
its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent
trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with
non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios:
weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game
dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance,
which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the
conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective
conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified
sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football
datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that
joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative
models for interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捆绑定价是收益管理中的经典问题，但由于候选捆绑组合数量呈指数级增长，该问题通常难以处理。需要开发高效的方法来解决这一挑战。

Abstract: Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e.,
bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit.
It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries,
such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically
intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper,
we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the
bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation
of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a
specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal
bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to
derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further
proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN
trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve
near-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational
time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions
for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as
bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions
for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where
product utilities are non-additive.

TL;DR: 本文研究表明激活函数选择是缓解持续学习中塑性损失的关键因素，提出了两种新的非线性激活函数，并在监督学习和强化学习环境中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习场景中，模型不仅面临灾难性遗忘问题，还会逐渐丧失适应能力（称为塑性损失），而激活函数在这种失效模式中的作用尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 基于对负分支形状和饱和行为的属性级分析，引入了两种即插即用的非线性激活函数（Smooth-Leaky和Randomized Smooth-Leaky），并在监督类增量基准和非平稳MuJoCo强化学习环境中进行评估。

Result: 研究表明，精心设计的激活函数能够在不增加额外容量或任务特定调优的情况下，为持续学习提供轻量级、领域通用的塑性维持方法。

Conclusion: 激活函数选择是缓解持续学习中塑性损失的主要架构无关杠杆，合理的激活设计能够有效维持模型的适应能力。

Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation
functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink
once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the
picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively
lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of
the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that
activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating
plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape
and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky
and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings:
(i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning
with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled
distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and
diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under
change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a
lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning
without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

Motivation: 深度强化学习样本效率低，特别是在多任务设置中，这源于在高维冗余参数空间中直接优化策略。

Method: 训练生成模型将策略参数空间压缩到低维潜在空间，使用行为重建损失确保潜在空间按功能相似性组织，并在潜在空间中进行策略梯度优化。

Result: 在连续控制领域验证，标准策略网络的参数化可压缩达五个数量级，同时保留大部分表达能力。

Conclusion: 学习到的流形支持在潜在空间中进行任务特定适应，证明了该方法在提高样本效率和促进多任务学习方面的有效性。

Abstract: Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is
notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the
standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and
highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded
in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach
that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional
latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model
$g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which
ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than
proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality
of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the
size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control
domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be
compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its
expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables
task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space
$\mathcal{Z}$.

Abstract: The northeastern region of the Czech Republic is among the most seismically
active areas in the country. The most frequent seismic events are
mining-induced since there used to be strong mining activity in the past.
However, natural tectonic events may also occur. In addition, seismic stations
often record explosions in quarries in the region. Despite the cessation of
mining activities, mine-induced seismic events still occur. Therefore, a rapid
differentiation between tectonic and anthropogenic events is still important.
  The region is currently monitored by the OKC seismic station in
Ostrava-Kr\'{a}sn\'{e} Pole built in 1983 which is a part of the Czech Regional
Seismic Network. The station has been providing digital continuous waveform
data at 100 Hz since 2007. In the years 1992--2002, the region was co-monitored
by the Seismic Polygon Fren\v{s}t\'{a}t (SPF) which consisted of five seismic
stations using a triggered STA/LTA system.
  In this study, we apply and compare machine learning methods to the SPF
dataset, which contains labeled records of tectonic and mining-induced events.
For binary classification, a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network
and XGBoost achieved an F1-score of 0.94 -- 0.95, demonstrating the potential
of modern machine learning techniques for rapid event characterization.

Motivation: 在多回合稀疏奖励环境中训练LLM智能体面临独特挑战：早期策略过早收敛和晚期策略崩溃，传统熵正则化方法在此类设置中反而有害。

Method: EPO框架包含三个机制：多回合环境中的熵正则化、熵平滑正则化器限制策略熵在历史平均值范围内、自适应阶段权重平衡探索与利用。

Result: EPO在ScienceWorld上实现高达152%的性能提升，在ALFWorld上实现19.8%的性能提升，保证熵方差单调递减同时维持收敛性。

Conclusion: 多回合稀疏奖励环境需要与传统强化学习根本不同的熵控制方法，EPO为LLM智能体训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where
completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode,
presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a
critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

Motivation: 传统CIL评估协议仅从少量随机序列中计算均值和方差，无法捕捉完整性能范围，导致均值估计偏差和方差严重低估。需要更稳健的评估方法来准确表征整个性能分布。

Method: 提出EDGE评估协议，引入极端序列概念，利用任务间相似性与模型性能的正相关性，自适应地识别和采样极端类别序列，从而更接近真实性能分布。

Result: 大量实验表明EDGE能有效捕捉性能极值，提供更准确的分布边界估计，为模型选择和鲁棒性检查提供可行见解。

Conclusion: EDGE协议通过极端序列采样提供了更可靠的CIL评估方法，能够更准确地反映模型在各种类别序列下的性能分布特征。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new
classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable
performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the
order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model
performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream
evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of
randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results
demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance
range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the
true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a
robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the
entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of
extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role
in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive
correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation
that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on
these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and
Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies
and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a
closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and
yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing
actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking. Our code is

Abstract: Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains
such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these
models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential
sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the
number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation
approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative
performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully
approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In
this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based
sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators
that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow
process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on
high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation,
and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.

Result: 该方法能够在训练过程中保持良好平衡的熵范围，促进技能积累的同时加速解决方案迭代，避免了无界熵增长和训练不稳定性。

Conclusion: SPEAR通过课程式自模仿学习有效解决了强化学习中的探索-利用权衡问题，为训练智能LLM代理提供了稳定且高效的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic
tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,
yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but
such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to
the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive
exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own
experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway
divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)
recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a
replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy
update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range
of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum
to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster
skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.
At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the
accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar
distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As
training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing
successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level
exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.
To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in
the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such
as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and
advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb
over-confidence.

*Junkang Wu,Kexin Huang,Jiancan Wu,An Zhang,Xiang Wang,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Quantile Advantage Estimation (QAE)方法，通过使用分位数基线替代均值基线来解决RLVR训练中的熵崩溃和熵爆炸问题，实现了稳定的熵控制和持续的推理性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均值的价值无关RL方法在奖励异常值情况下会不当惩罚负优势样本，导致训练在熵崩溃和熵爆炸之间振荡，影响LLM推理的稳定性。

Method: 提出QAE方法，用分组K-分位数基线替代均值基线，在困难查询中强化罕见成功，在简单查询中针对剩余失败，通过一阶softmax更新实现双向熵安全。

Result: QAE稳定了熵动态，稀疏化了信用分配（约80%响应获得零优势），在Qwen3-8B/14B-Base模型上实现了AIME 2024/2025和AMC 2023任务的持续pass@1增益。

Conclusion: 基线设计而非token级启发式是扩展RLVR的主要机制，QAE为强化学习在语言模型推理中的应用提供了稳定有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM
reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and
{entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in
value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes
negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile
Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile
baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <=
1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it
targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove
{two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy
change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal
modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K,
roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1
gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results
identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the
primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL在数据稀缺环境下比SFT具有更好的泛化性和校准响应，但推理计算成本更高。研究能否利用ICL的内部计算来改进SFT的质量。

Method: 首先分析ICL和SFT产生不同的激活模式，然后提出ICL激活对齐(IA2)自蒸馏技术，在SFT前作为预训练步骤，让SFT模型复制ICL的激活模式并激励ICL式的内部推理。

Result: 在12个流行基准测试和2个模型家族上的广泛实证结果显示，IA2显著提高了模型输出的准确性和校准性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅具有实际应用价值，还为理解模型适应的内部机制提供了概念窗口。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training
weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast,
In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or
demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more
calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of
more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal
computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL
and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods
achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this
observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation
Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's
activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.
Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy
and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results
on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only
practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner
mechanics of model adaptation.

Conclusion: CEA方法能有效学习可采纳启发式，同时为神经网络启发式学习提供了首个目标依赖启发式的泛化保证，解决了现有方法的两个关键缺陷。

Abstract: Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such
as A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true
shortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning
approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on
generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these
limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization
problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that
enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method
yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than
compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the
sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and
the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the
bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize.
Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds
that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph
size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization
guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.

Abstract: We study the problem of causal structure learning from a combination of
observational and interventional data generated by a linear non-Gaussian
structural equation model that might contain cycles. Recent results show that
using mere observational data identifies the causal graph only up to a
permutation-equivalence class. We obtain a combinatorial characterization of
this class by showing that each graph in an equivalence class corresponds to a
perfect matching in a bipartite graph. This bipartite representation allows us
to analyze how interventions modify or constrain the matchings. Specifically,
we show that each atomic intervention reveals one edge of the true matching and
eliminates all incompatible causal graphs. Consequently, we formalize the
optimal experiment design task as an adaptive stochastic optimization problem
over the set of equivalence classes with a natural reward function that
quantifies how many graphs are eliminated from the equivalence class by an
intervention. We show that this reward function is adaptive submodular and
provide a greedy policy with a provable near-optimal performance guarantee. A
key technical challenge is to efficiently estimate the reward function without
having to explicitly enumerate all the graphs in the equivalence class. We
propose a sampling-based estimator using random matchings and analyze its bias
and concentration behavior. Our simulation results show that performing a small
number of interventions guided by our stochastic optimization framework
recovers the true underlying causal structure.

Motivation: 研究当放宽SBL中噪声样本和权重分布的高斯假设时，边际似然函数作为单个超参数函数的行为特征，以理解SBL在更广泛条件下的稀疏性机制。

Method: 通过分析边际似然函数作为单个超参数的函数（保持其他超参数固定），推导出导致有限和无限超参数估计的充分条件，并在高斯情况下与F-SBL算法进行比较。

Result: 建立了在非高斯假设下导致超参数估计有限或无限的充分条件，证明了在高斯情况下这些条件与F-SBL的剪枝条件互补且一致。

Conclusion: 该分析为SBL算法提供了更深入的理论理解，特别是在放宽高斯假设时稀疏性机制的行为特征，增强了算法理论基础。

Abstract: Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) associates to each weight in the underlying
linear model a hyperparameter by assuming that each weight is Gaussian
distributed with zero mean and precision (inverse variance) equal to its
associated hyperparameter. The method estimates the hyperparameters by
marginalizing out the weights and performing (marginalized) maximum likelihood
(ML) estimation. SBL returns many hyperparameter estimates to diverge to
infinity, effectively setting the estimates of the corresponding weights to
zero (i.e., pruning the corresponding weights from the model) and thereby
yielding a sparse estimate of the weight vector.
  In this letter, we analyze the marginal likelihood as function of a single
hyperparameter while keeping the others fixed, when the Gaussian assumptions on
the noise samples and the weight distribution that underlies the derivation of
SBL are weakened. We derive sufficient conditions that lead, on the one hand,
to finite hyperparameter estimates and, on the other, to infinite ones.
Finally, we show that in the Gaussian case, the two conditions are
complementary and coincide with the pruning condition of fast SBL (F-SBL),
thereby providing additional insights into this algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态学习中，共享特征和模态特定特征对于表征细胞状态和支持下游分析都至关重要。理想的模态特定特征应与共享特征独立，同时捕获每个模态内的所有互补信息。

Method: IndiSeek结合了独立性强制目标和计算高效的重建损失，该重建损失约束了条件互信息，从而在独立性和完整性之间实现平衡。

Conclusion: IndiSeek能够通过原则性方法提取模态特定特征，解决了基于互信息目标在实践中的估计困难和性能不足问题。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations is a fundamental task in multi-modal
learning. In modern applications such as single-cell multi-omics, both shared
and modality-specific features are critical for characterizing cell states and
supporting downstream analyses. Ideally, modality-specific features should be
independent of shared ones while also capturing all complementary information
within each modality. This tradeoff is naturally expressed through
information-theoretic criteria, but mutual-information-based objectives are
difficult to estimate reliably, and their variational surrogates often
underperform in practice. In this paper, we introduce IndiSeek, a novel
disentangled representation learning approach that addresses this challenge by
combining an independence-enforcing objective with a computationally efficient
reconstruction loss that bounds conditional mutual information. This
formulation explicitly balances independence and completeness, enabling
principled extraction of modality-specific features. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of IndiSeek on synthetic simulations, a CITE-seq dataset and
multiple real-world multi-modal benchmarks.

investigate scaling rules between the learning rate and key hyperparameters in
adaptive methods, characterising all non-trivial limiting dynamics.

Abstract: Real-world applications often face scarce labeled data due to the high cost
and time requirements of gold-standard experiments, whereas unlabeled data are
typically abundant. With the growing adoption of machine learning techniques,
it has become increasingly feasible to generate multiple predicted labels using
a variety of models and algorithms, including deep learning, large language
models, and generative AI. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
safely and adaptively aggregates multiple black-box predictions with unknown
quality while preserving valid statistical inference. Our method provides two
key guarantees: (i) it never performs worse than using the labeled data alone,
regardless of the quality of the predictions; and (ii) if any one of the
predictions (without knowing which one) perfectly fits the ground truth, the
algorithm adaptively exploits this to achieve either a faster convergence rate
or the semiparametric efficiency bound. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm through experiments on both synthetic and benchmark
datasets.

Abstract: As data collection and simulation capabilities advance, multi-modal learning,
the task of learning from multiple modalities and sources of data, is becoming
an increasingly important area of research. Surrogate models that learn from
data of multiple auxiliary modalities to support the modeling of a highly
expensive quantity of interest have the potential to aid outer loop
applications such as optimization, inverse problems, or sensitivity analyses
when multi-modal data are available. We develop two multi-modal Bayesian neural
network surrogate models and leverage conditionally conjugate distributions in
the last layer to estimate model parameters using stochastic variational
inference (SVI). We provide a method to perform this conjugate SVI estimation
in the presence of partially missing observations. We demonstrate improved
prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification compared to uni-modal
surrogate models for both scalar and time series data.

TL;DR: 提出因果目标对齐原则，开发Causal-EPIG框架，通过信息理论方法直接针对不可观测的因果量进行主动学习，显著提升CATE估计的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习策略存在目标不匹配问题，它们旨在减少模型参数或可观测事实结果的不确定性，而非直接针对真正感兴趣的不可观测因果量（如潜在结果和CATE）。

Method: 引入因果目标对齐原则，开发Causal-EPIG框架，基于期望预测信息增益(EPIG)准则，量化查询在减少不可观测因果量不确定性方面的价值。从该统一框架衍生出两种策略：全面方法（通过联合潜在结果稳健建模完整因果机制）和专注方法（直接针对CATE估计量以实现最大样本效率）。

Result: 广泛实验表明，我们的策略始终优于标准基线方法，并关键性地揭示了最优策略是上下文相关的，取决于基础估计器和数据复杂性。

Conclusion: 该框架为实践中样本高效的CATE估计提供了原则性指导，因果目标对齐原则能够有效解决传统主动学习策略的目标不匹配问题。

Abstract: Estimating the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) is often
constrained by the high cost of obtaining outcome measurements, making active
learning essential. However, conventional active learning strategies suffer
from a fundamental objective mismatch. They are designed to reduce uncertainty
in model parameters or in observable factual outcomes, failing to directly
target the unobservable causal quantities that are the true objects of
interest. To address this misalignment, we introduce the principle of causal
objective alignment, which posits that acquisition functions should target
unobservable causal quantities, such as the potential outcomes and the CATE,
rather than indirect proxies. We operationalize this principle through the
Causal-EPIG framework, which adapts the information-theoretic criterion of
Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG) to explicitly quantify the value of
a query in terms of reducing uncertainty about unobservable causal quantities.
From this unified framework, we derive two distinct strategies that embody a
fundamental trade-off: a comprehensive approach that robustly models the full
causal mechanisms via the joint potential outcomes, and a focused approach that
directly targets the CATE estimand for maximum sample efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our strategies consistently outperform standard
baselines, and crucially, reveal that the optimal strategy is
context-dependent, contingent on the base estimator and data complexity. Our
framework thus provides a principled guide for sample-efficient CATE estimation
in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of distributed mean estimation with 1-bit
communication constraints. We propose a mean estimator that is based on
(randomized and sequentially-chosen) interval queries, whose 1-bit outcome
indicates whether the given sample lies in the specified interval. Our
estimator is $(\epsilon, \delta)$-PAC for all distributions with bounded mean
($-\lambda \le \mathbb{E}(X) \le \lambda $) and variance ($\mathrm{Var}(X) \le
\sigma^2$) for some known parameters $\lambda$ and $\sigma$. We derive a sample
complexity bound $\widetilde{O}\big(
\frac{\sigma^2}{\epsilon^2}\log\frac{1}{\delta} +
\log\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}\big)$, which matches the minimax lower bound for the
unquantized setting up to logarithmic factors and the additional
$\log\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}$ term that we show to be unavoidable. We also
establish an adaptivity gap for interval-query based estimators: the best
non-adaptive mean estimator is considerably worse than our adaptive mean
estimator for large $\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}$. Finally, we give tightened sample
complexity bounds for distributions with stronger tail decay, and present
additional variants that (i) handle an unknown sampling budget (ii) adapt to
the unknown true variance given (possibly loose) upper and lower bounds on the
variance, and (iii) use only two stages of adaptivity at the expense of more
complicated (non-interval) queries.

Motivation: 现有离散时间霍克斯模型通常受限于固定形式的基线和激励核，缺乏对两者的灵活非参数化处理。许多应用在规则网格上记录事件计数，但离散时间霍克斯模型相对较少使用。

Conclusion: 结果表明，可以在不牺牲可扩展性或可解释性的情况下实现灵活的离散时间自激励建模。

Abstract: Hawkes process models are used in settings where past events increase the
likelihood of future events occurring. Many applications record events as
counts on a regular grid, yet discrete-time Hawkes models remain comparatively
underused and are often constrained by fixed-form baselines and excitation
kernels. In particular, there is a lack of flexible, nonparametric treatments
of both the baseline and the excitation in discrete time. To this end, we
propose the Gaussian Process Discrete Hawkes Process (GP-DHP), a nonparametric
framework that places Gaussian process priors on both the baseline and the
excitation and performs inference through a collapsed latent representation.
This yields smooth, data-adaptive structure without prespecifying trends,
periodicities, or decay shapes, and enables maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimation with near-linear-time \(O(T\log T)\) complexity. A closed-form
projection recovers interpretable baseline and excitation functions from the
optimized latent trajectory. In simulations, GP-DHP recovers diverse excitation
shapes and evolving baselines. In case studies on U.S. terrorism incidents and
weekly Cryptosporidiosis counts, it improves test predictive log-likelihood
over standard parametric discrete Hawkes baselines while capturing bursts,
delays, and seasonal background variation. The results indicate that flexible
discrete-time self-excitation can be achieved without sacrificing scalability
or interpretability.

Abstract: We present a rigorous asymptotic analysis of Echo State Networks (ESNs) in a
teacher student setting with a linear teacher with oracle weights. Leveraging
random matrix theory, we derive closed form expressions for the asymptotic
bias, variance, and mean-squared error (MSE) as functions of the input
statistics, the oracle vector, and the ridge regularization parameter. The
analysis reveals two key departures from classical ridge regression: (i) ESNs
do not exhibit double descent, and (ii) ESNs attain lower MSE when both the
number of training samples and the teacher memory length are limited. We
further provide an explicit formula for the optimal regularization in the
identity input covariance case, and propose an efficient numerical scheme to
compute the optimum in the general case. Together, these results offer
interpretable theory and practical guidelines for tuning ESNs, helping
reconcile recent empirical observations with provable performance guarantees

Abstract: Regularized linear regression is central to machine learning, yet its
high-dimensional behavior with informative priors remains poorly understood. We
provide the first exact asymptotic characterization of training and test risks
for maximum a posteriori (MAP) regression with Gaussian priors centered at a
domain-informed initialization. Our framework unifies ridge regression, least
squares, and prior-informed estimators, and -- using random matrix theory --
yields closed-form risk formulas that expose the bias-variance-prior tradeoff,
explain double descent, and quantify prior mismatch. We also identify a
closed-form minimizer of test risk, enabling a simple estimator of the optimal
regularization parameter. Simulations confirm the theory with high accuracy. By
connecting Bayesian priors, classical regularization, and modern asymptotics,
our results provide both conceptual clarity and practical guidance for learning
with structured prior knowledge.

*Anvit Garg,Sohom Bhattacharya,Pragya Sur*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文研究了过参数化线性回归中模型崩溃现象，分析了在迭代训练中使用真实数据和合成数据混合时，如何通过最优混合权重防止模型退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究模型崩溃现象——当生成模型反复使用自身合成输出训练时出现的性能退化问题，旨在找到防止这种退化的最优数据混合策略。

Method: 采用过参数化线性回归框架，分析最小L2范数插值和岭回归在迭代训练方案中的表现，推导了精确的泛化误差公式，并研究了最优混合权重。

Result: 发现最小L2范数插值的最优真实数据比例收敛于黄金分割比的倒数；对于岭回归，最优混合比例至少为1/2，表明需要偏向真实数据。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和模拟验证，确定了防止模型崩溃的最优数据混合策略，揭示了谱几何在决定最优权重中的关键作用。

Abstract: Model collapse occurs when generative models degrade after repeatedly
training on their own synthetic outputs. We study this effect in
overparameterized linear regression in a setting where each iteration mixes
fresh real labels with synthetic labels drawn from the model fitted in the
previous iteration. We derive precise generalization error formulae for
minimum-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation and ridge regression under this iterative
scheme. Our analysis reveals intriguing properties of the optimal mixing weight
that minimizes long-term prediction error and provably prevents model collapse.
For instance, in the case of min-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation, we establish that
the optimal real-data proportion converges to the reciprocal of the golden
ratio for fairly general classes of covariate distributions. Previously, this
property was known only for ordinary least squares, and additionally in low
dimensions. For ridge regression, we further analyze two popular model classes
-- the random-effects model and the spiked covariance model -- demonstrating
how spectral geometry governs optimal weighting. In both cases, as well as for
isotropic features, we uncover that the optimal mixing ratio should be at least
one-half, reflecting the necessity of favoring real-data over synthetic. We
validate our theoretical results with extensive simulations.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出VecUQ-OT方法，通过将多个不确定性度量组合成向量，并使用基于最优传输的排序方法生成Monge-Kantorovich秩，实现多维不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不确定性量化方法通常只提供单一标量值作为模型可靠性度量，但不同的不确定性度量可能提供互补信息，即使针对同一类型的不确定性也可能捕捉到不同的失效模式。

Method: 将互补的不确定性度量堆叠成向量，使用熵正则化最优传输学习在分布内数据上的传输映射，生成Monge-Kantorovich秩来排序预测的不确定性。

Result: VecUQ-OT在合成、图像和文本数据上表现出高效率，即使单个度量失效时仍能有效工作，支持灵活的非加性不确定性融合。

Conclusion: 该框架为下游任务（如选择性预测、误分类检测、分布外检测和选择性生成）提供了稳健的排序，无需重新训练即可应用于未见输入，包括分布外情况。

Abstract: Most uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches provide a single scalar value
as a measure of model reliability. However, different uncertainty measures
could provide complementary information on the prediction confidence. Even
measures targeting the same type of uncertainty (e.g., ensemble-based and
density-based measures of epistemic uncertainty) may capture different failure
modes.
  We take a multidimensional view on UQ by stacking complementary UQ measures
into a vector. Such vectors are assigned with Monge-Kantorovich ranks produced
by an optimal-transport-based ordering method. The prediction is then deemed
more uncertain than the other if it has a higher rank.
  The resulting VecUQ-OT algorithm uses entropy-regularized optimal transport.
The transport map is learned on vectors of scores from in-distribution data
and, by design, applies to unseen inputs, including out-of-distribution cases,
without retraining.
  Our framework supports flexible non-additive uncertainty fusion (including
aleatoric and epistemic components). It yields a robust ordering for downstream
tasks such as selective prediction, misclassification detection,
out-of-distribution detection, and selective generation. Across synthetic,
image, and text data, VecUQ-OT shows high efficiency even when individual
measures fail. The code for the method is available at:

TL;DR: RealUID是一个通用的匹配模型蒸馏框架，能够无缝整合真实数据到蒸馏过程中，无需使用GANs，解决了现有方法局限于特定框架和数据依赖的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代扩散、流匹配等模型虽然生成质量优秀，但推理速度慢。现有蒸馏方法局限于特定框架且无法有效利用真实数据，需要复杂的对抗训练。

Method: 提出RealUID通用蒸馏框架，基于简单的理论基础，覆盖Flow Matching和Diffusion模型的蒸馏方法，并可扩展到Bridge Matching和Stochastic Interpolants等变体。

Result: 该框架能够在不使用GANs的情况下将真实数据整合到蒸馏过程中，提高了蒸馏效率和通用性。

Conclusion: RealUID为各种匹配模型提供了一个统一、简单且有效的蒸馏解决方案，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: While achieving exceptional generative quality, modern diffusion, flow, and
other matching models suffer from slow inference, as they require many steps of
iterative generation. Recent distillation methods address this by training
efficient one-step generators under the guidance of a pre-trained teacher
model. However, these methods are often constrained to only one specific
framework, e.g., only to diffusion or only to flow models. Furthermore, these
methods are naturally data-free, and to benefit from the usage of real data, it
is required to use an additional complex adversarial training with an extra
discriminator model. In this paper, we present RealUID, a universal
distillation framework for all matching models that seamlessly incorporates
real data into the distillation procedure without GANs. Our RealUID approach
offers a simple theoretical foundation that covers previous distillation
methods for Flow Matching and Diffusion models, and is also extended to their
modifications, such as Bridge Matching and Stochastic Interpolants.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: causalKANs框架将神经因果效应估计器转换为可解释的Kolmogorov-Arnold网络，通过剪枝和符号简化生成闭式公式，在保持预测精度的同时提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在估计异质处理效应方面表现优异，但其不透明性限制了在医学、经济学等敏感领域的信任和采用。

Method: 基于成熟的因果神经架构，将条件平均处理效应(CATE)的神经估计器转换为KANs，并加入剪枝和符号简化技术。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，causalKANs在CATE误差指标上与神经基线方法表现相当，即使简单的KAN变体也能达到有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: causalKANs通过结合可靠性和分析可访问性，提供由闭式表达式和可解释图支持的可审计估计器，使高风险环境中的个性化决策更加可信。

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance in estimating
heterogeneous treatment effects, but their opacity limits trust and adoption in
sensitive domains such as medicine, economics, and public policy. Building on
well-established and high-performing causal neural architectures, we propose
causalKANs, a framework that transforms neural estimators of conditional
average treatment effects (CATEs) into Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs). By
incorporating pruning and symbolic simplification, causalKANs yields
interpretable closed-form formulas while preserving predictive accuracy.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that causalKANs perform on par
with neural baselines in CATE error metrics, and that even simple KAN variants
achieve competitive performance, offering a favorable
accuracy--interpretability trade-off. By combining reliability with analytic
accessibility, causalKANs provide auditable estimators supported by closed-form
expressions and interpretable plots, enabling trustworthy individualized
decision-making in high-stakes settings. We release the code for
reproducibility at https://github.com/aalmodovares/causalkans .

*Mingyi Zheng,Hongyu Jiang,Yizhou Lu,Jiaye Teng*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了SCD-split方法，在保形预测框架中引入平滑操作，将多个不连续子区间合并为可解释的预测集，在保持覆盖率和区间长度的同时减少不连续子区间数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的保形预测方法如CD-split虽然提高了效率，但产生的预测集由多个不连续子区间组成，难以解释。需要一种方法既能保持统计严谨性，又能产生更易解释的预测集。

Method: 在保形预测框架中引入平滑操作，通过平滑操作帮助合并子区间，从而产生更易解释的预测集。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验结果表明，SCD-split在区间长度和不连续子区间数量之间取得了平衡。理论上，在特定条件下，SCD-split可证明减少不连续子区间数量，同时保持与CD-split相当的覆盖保证和区间长度。

Conclusion: SCD-split方法成功地将平滑操作整合到保形预测框架中，在保持统计严谨性的同时显著提高了预测集的可解释性。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a distribution-free framework for constructing
statistically rigorous prediction sets. While popular variants such as CD-split
improve CP's efficiency, they often yield prediction sets composed of multiple
disconnected subintervals, which are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we
propose SCD-split, which incorporates smoothing operations into the CP
framework. Such smoothing operations potentially help merge the subintervals,
thus leading to interpretable prediction sets. Experimental results on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SCD-split balances the
interval length and the number of disconnected subintervals. Theoretically,
under specific conditions, SCD-split provably reduces the number of
disconnected subintervals while maintaining comparable coverage guarantees and
interval length compared with CD-split.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种去偏学习器（FD-DR-Learner和FD-R-Learner），用于在前门调整框架下估计异质性处理效应，即使在干扰函数收敛速度仅为n^-1/4时也能达到准神谕速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在观测性研究中，当处理和结果存在未测量的混杂因素但观测到的中介变量无混杂时，前门调整可以通过中介变量识别因果效应。需要开发能够在前门识别下估计异质性处理效应的可靠方法。

Method: 引入了两种去偏学习器：FD-DR-Learner和FD-R-Learner，它们在前门调整框架下工作，即使干扰函数收敛缓慢也能保持稳健性能。

Result: 通过误差分析证明了去偏性，在合成研究和真实世界案例（使用FARS数据集研究安全带法律）中展示了稳健的实证性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的学习器在前门场景中能够提供可靠且样本效率高的异质性处理效应估计。

Abstract: In observational settings where treatment and outcome share unmeasured
confounders but an observed mediator remains unconfounded, the front-door (FD)
adjustment identifies causal effects through the mediator. We study the
heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) under FD identification and introduce two
debiased learners: FD-DR-Learner and FD-R-Learner. Both attain fast,
quasi-oracle rates (i.e., performance comparable to an oracle that knows the
nuisances) even when nuisance functions converge as slowly as n^-1/4. We
provide error analyses establishing debiasedness and demonstrate robust
empirical performance in synthetic studies and a real-world case study of
primary seat-belt laws using Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset.
Together, these results indicate that the proposed learners deliver reliable
and sample-efficient HTE estimates in FD scenarios. The implementation is
available at https://github.com/yonghanjung/FD-CATE.

Motivation: 现有方法难以有效分析参数化网络数据，需要一种统一的框架来比较时变网络、演化网络和随机图模型。

Method: 基于Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输变体，定义参数化Gromov-Wasserstein距离族，建立理论性质，开发计算可行的下界，并与图统计量关联。

Conclusion: 该框架为参数化网络数据分析提供了统一的理论和计算工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce a general framework for analyzing data modeled as parameterized
families of networks. Building on a Gromov-Wasserstein variant of optimal
transport, we define a family of parameterized Gromov-Wasserstein distances for
comparing such parametric data, including time-varying metric spaces induced by
collective motion, temporally evolving weighted social networks, and random
graph models. We establish foundational properties of these distances, showing
that they subsume several existing metrics in the literature, and derive
theoretical approximation guarantees. In particular, we develop computationally
tractable lower bounds and relate them to graph statistics commonly used in
random graph theory. Furthermore, we prove that our distances can be
consistently approximated in random graph and random metric space settings via
empirical estimates from generative models. Finally, we demonstrate the
practical utility of our framework through a series of numerical experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性因果表示学习方法依赖严格假设，如需要单节点干预数据或对潜在特征和测量噪声的严格分布约束，这些前提在某些场景中难以满足。

Method: 开发了一种新的线性CRL算法，在线性结构因果模型和线性混合函数的框架下，基于较弱的关于环境异质性和数据生成分布的假设。

Conclusion: 提出的线性CRL算法在较弱假设下仍能有效工作，为将因果性整合到人工智能提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) has garnered increasing interests from
the causal inference and artificial intelligence community, due to its
capability of disentangling potentially complex data-generating mechanism into
causally interpretable latent features, by leveraging the heterogeneity of
modern datasets. In this paper, we further contribute to the CRL literature, by
focusing on the stylized linear structural causal model over the latent
features and assuming a linear mixing function that maps latent features to the
observed data or measurements. Existing linear CRL methods often rely on
stringent assumptions, such as accessibility to single-node interventional data
or restrictive distributional constraints on latent features and exogenous
measurement noise. However, these prerequisites can be challenging to satisfy
in certain scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel linear CRL algorithm
that, unlike most existing linear CRL methods, operates under weaker
assumptions about environment heterogeneity and data-generating distributions
while still recovering latent causal features up to an equivalence class. We
further validate our new algorithm via synthetic experiments and an
interpretability analysis of large language models (LLMs), demonstrating both
its superiority over competing methods in finite samples and its potential in
integrating causality into AI.

Motivation: 现有基于乐观的探索算法在采样协议上存在缺陷，倾向于收集无法减少奖励差异中最具信息性不确定性的比较，导致线性遗憾。

Method: 提出新的探索方案，在multi-armed bandit模型下，将偏好查询导向减少与策略改进最相关的奖励差异不确定性。

Conclusion: 这是第一个在所有模型参数中具有多项式缩放遗憾的在线RLHF算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward
model from human preference data and then optimizes a policy to favor preferred
responses, has emerged as a central paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate exploration
principles for online RLHF, where one seeks to adaptively collect new
preference data to refine both the reward model and the policy in a
data-efficient manner. By examining existing optimism-based exploration
algorithms, we identify a drawback in their sampling protocol: they tend to
gather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties in
reward differences, and we prove lower bounds showing that such methods can
incur linear regret over exponentially long horizons. Motivated by this
insight, we propose a new exploration scheme that directs preference queries
toward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy
improvement. Under a multi-armed bandit model of RLHF, we establish regret
bounds of order $T^{(\beta+1)/(\beta+2)}$, where $\beta>0$ is a hyperparameter
that balances reward maximization against mitigating distribution shift. To our
knowledge, this is the first online RLHF algorithm with regret scaling
polynomially in all model parameters.
