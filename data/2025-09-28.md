Abstract: Bearings are among the most failure-prone components in rotating machinery,
and their condition directly impacts overall performance. Therefore, accurately
diagnosing bearing faults is essential for ensuring system stability. However,
detecting such malfunctions in noisy environments, where data is collected from
multiple sensors, necessitates the extraction and selection of informative
features. This paper proposes an improved distance evaluation algorithm
combined with a weighted K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier for bearing fault
diagnosis. The process begins with extracting and integrating statistical
features of vibration across the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains.
Next, the improved distance evaluation algorithm assigns weights to the
extracted features, retaining only the most informative ones by eliminating
insensitive features. Finally, the selected features are used to train the
weighted KNN classifier. To validate the proposed method, we employ bearing
data from the University of Ottawa. The results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in accurately identifying bearing faults.

### [2] [Real-Time Markov Modeling for Single-Photon LiDAR: $1000 \times$ Acceleration and Convergence Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20500)
*Weijian Zhang,Hashan K. Weerasooriya,Prateek Chennuri,Stanley H. Chan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个非序列马尔可夫模型来建模异步单光子激光雷达的时间戳分布，通过重新参数化积分边界并将死时间效应分离为基矩阵的确定性行置换，实现了比现有方法快1000倍的向量化矩阵构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步单光子激光雷达在存在死时间的情况下，其时间戳分布的建模是一个极具挑战性的开放问题。现有方法需要构建大型转移矩阵，计算成本高昂。

Method: 提出等效公式，重新参数化积分边界，将死时间效应分离为基矩阵的确定性行置换，实现状态与死时间的解耦，支持高效的向量化矩阵构建。

Result: 新模型与蒙特卡洛模拟的黄金标准相比产生几乎精确的稳态分布，同时仅使用一小部分时间，实现了高达1000倍的加速。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提高了建模效率，同时新的理论分析揭示了第二大特征值的幅度和相位对收敛性的关键影响，这在文献中被忽视但至关重要。

Abstract: Asynchronous single-photon LiDAR (SP-LiDAR) is an important imaging modality
for high-quality 3D applications and navigation, but the modeling of the
timestamp distributions of a SP-LiDAR in the presence of dead time remains a
very challenging open problem. Prior works have shown that timestamps form a
discrete-time Markov chain, whose stationary distribution can be computed as
the leading left eigenvector of a large transition matrix. However,
constructing this matrix is known to be computationally expensive because of
the coupling between states and the dead time. This paper presents the first
non-sequential Markov modeling for the timestamp distribution. The key
innovation is an equivalent formulation that reparameterizes the integral
bounds and separates the effect of dead time as a deterministic row permutation
of a base matrix. This decoupling enables efficient vectorized matrix
construction, yielding up to $1000 \times$ acceleration over existing methods.
The new model produces a nearly exact stationary distribution when compared
with the gold standard Monte Carlo simulations, yet using a fraction of the
time. In addition, a new theoretical analysis reveals the impact of the
magnitude and phase of the second-largest eigenvalue, which are overlooked in
the literature but are critical to the convergence.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了一种实用的离散夹持天线辅助无线供电移动边缘计算框架，通过联合优化能量收集和任务卸载策略，比较了TDMA和NOMA在不同PA激活灵活性下的性能表现。

Conclusion: 离散PA辅助的无线供电MEC系统能有效提升系统性能，PA激活粒度对TDMA和NOMA的性能比较有重要影响，精细化激活使TDMA表现更优。

Abstract: Pinching antennas (PAs), a new type of reconfigurable and flexible antenna
structures, have recently attracted significant research interest due to their
ability to create line-of-sight links and mitigate large-scale path loss. Owing
to their potential benefits, integrating PAs into wireless powered mobile edge
computing (MEC) systems is regarded as a viable solution to enhance both energy
transfer and task offloading efficiency. Unlike prior studies that assume ideal
continuous PA placement along waveguides, this paper investigates a practical
discrete PA-assisted wireless powered MEC framework, where devices first
harvest energy from PA-emitted radio-frequency signals and then adopt a partial
offloading mode, allocating part of the harvested energy to local computing and
the remainder to uplink offloading. The uplink phase considers both the
time-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),
each examined under three levels of PA activation flexibility. For each
configuration, we formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the total
computational bits and conduct a theoretical performance comparison between the
TDMA and NOMA schemes. To address the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear
problems, we develop a two-layer algorithm that combines closed-form solutions
based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with a cross-entropy-based
learning method. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed
design in terms of the harvested energy and computation performance, revealing
that TDMA and NOMA achieve comparable performance under coarser PA activation
levels, whereas finer activation granularity enables TDMA to achieve superior
computation performance over NOMA.

### [4] [A General Optimization Framework for Movable Antenna Systems via Discrete Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20987)

Conclusion: 该框架为可移动天线系统位置优化提供了一种通用且低复杂度的解决方案，有效避免了局部最优问题。

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) systems have attracted growing interest in wireless
communications due to their ability to reshape wireless channels via local
antenna movement within a confined region. However, optimizing antenna
positions to enhance communication performance turns out to be challenging due
to the highly nonlinear relationship between wireless channels and antenna
positions. Existing approaches, such as gradient-based and heuristic
algorithms, often suffer from high computational complexity or undesired local
optima. To address the above challenge, this letter proposes a general and
low-complexity optimization framework for MA position optimization.
Specifically, we discretize the antenna movement region into a set of sampling
points, thereby transforming the continuous optimization problem into a
discrete point selection problem. Next, we sequentially update the optimal
sampling point for each MA over multiple rounds. To avoid convergence to poor
local optima, a Gibbs sampling (GS) phase is introduced between rounds to
explore adjacent and randomly generated candidate solutions. As a case study,
we investigate joint precoding and antenna position optimization for an
MA-enhanced broadcast system by applying the proposed framework. Numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal
performance and significantly outperforms existing benchmarks.

### [5] [Shapley Features for Robust Signal Prediction in Tactile Internet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21032)
*Mohammad Ali Vahedifar,Qi Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合高斯过程(GP)和ResNet神经网络的新预测框架，通过GP恢复丢失或延迟的信号，并引入Shapley特征值(SFV)进行特征选择，在触觉互联网中实现了95.72%的准确率和显著的效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉互联网需要超低延迟和可靠的触觉信号传输，但数据包丢失和延迟问题仍未解决，需要开发更有效的预测方法。

Method: 集成高斯过程(GP)与基于ResNet的神经网络，GP作为oracle恢复丢失或延迟的信号，并引入Shapley特征值(SFV)进行特征选择以优化性能。

Result: 达到95.72%的准确率，比现有最优方法LeFo提升11.1%，同时放宽了触觉互联网的严格延迟约束。SFV作为模块化加速器，与LeFo配对减少27%推理时间，与GP配对减少72%推理时间。

Conclusion: GP+SFV框架提供了高精度和高效率的解决方案，为触觉互联网系统中实用可靠的触觉通信铺平了道路。

Abstract: The Tactile Internet (TI) requires ultra-low latency and reliable haptic
signal transmission, yet packet loss and delay remain unresolved challenges. We
present a novel prediction framework that integrates Gaussian Processes (GP)
with a ResNet-based Neural Network, where GP acts as an oracle to recover
signals lost or heavily delayed. To further optimize performance, we introduce
Shapley Feature Values (SFV), a principled feature selection mechanism that
isolates the most informative inputs for prediction. This GP+SFV framework
achieves 95.72% accuracy, surpassing the state-of-the-art LeFo method by 11.1%,
while simultaneously relaxing TI's rigid delay constraints. Beyond accuracy,
SFV operates as a modular accelerator: when paired with LeFo, it reduces
inference time by 27%, and when paired with GP, by 72%. These results establish
GP+SFV as both a high-accuracy and high-efficiency solution, paving the way for
practical and reliable haptic communications in TI systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MIMO-OFDM下行链路的神经ISAC信号处理框架，能够在无需修改通信链路的情况下实现广义感知功能，通过测量反向散射通信信号生成空间占用离散地图。

Abstract: The ongoing convergence of spectrum and hardware requirements for wireless
sensing and communication applications has fueled the integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) paradigm in next-generation networks. Neural-network-based
ISAC leverages data-driven learning techniques to add sensing capabilities to
existing communication infrastructure. This paper presents a novel
signal-processing framework for such neural ISAC systems based on the
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) downlink. Our approach enables generalized sensing
functionality without modifying the MIMO-OFDM communication link. Specifically,
our neural ISAC pipeline measures the backscattered communication signals to
generate discrete map representations of spatial occupancy, formulated as
multiclass or multilabel classification problems, which can then be utilized by
specialized downstream tasks. To improve sensing performance in closed or
cluttered environments, our neural ISAC pipeline relies on features
specifically designed to mitigate strong reflective paths. Extensive
simulations using ray-tracing models demonstrate that our neural ISAC framework
reliably reconstructs scene maps without altering the MIMO-OFDM communication
pipeline or reducing data rates.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在安全性、数据速率和感知性能方面均有显著提升，为集成感知与通信系统提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing the security, data rate,
and sensing performance of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)
systems. We employ a random frequency and pulse repetition interval (PRI)
agility (RFPA) method for the waveform design, where the necessary random
sequences are governed by shared secrets. These secrets, which can be
pre-shared or generated via channel reciprocity, obfuscate critical radar
parameters like Doppler frequency and pulse start times, thereby significantly
impeding the ability to perform reconnaissance from a passive adversary without
the secret key. To further introduce enhanced data throughput, we also
introduce a hybrid information embedding scheme that integrates amplitude shift
keying (ASK), phase shift keying (PSK), index modulation (IM), and spatial
modulation (SM), for which a low-complexity sparse-matched filter receiver is
proposed for accurate decoding with practical complexity. Finally, the
excellent range-velocity resolution and clutter suppression of the proposed
waveform are analyzed via the ambiguity function (AF).

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对非平稳MIMO无线信道的对抗性鲁棒物理层认证框架，该框架结合了序列贝叶斯决策、对比学习深度特征提取和生成对抗建模来模拟自适应欺骗者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设信道平稳或观测独立，无法有效处理非平稳MIMO信道中的时空相关性、视距阻塞和动态欺骗策略等挑战。

Abstract: We propose an adversarially robust physical layer authentication (AR-PLA)
framework tailored for non-stationary multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
wireless channels. The framework integrates sequential Bayesian
decision-making, deep feature extraction via contrastive learning, and
generative adversarial modeling to simulate adaptive spoofers. Unlike
conventional methods that assume stationary channels or independent
observations, our approach explicitly accounts for temporal and spatial
correlations, line-of-sight (LoS) blockages, and dynamic spoofing strategies. A
comprehensive analytical characterization of the authentication performance
using both 2-state and 3-state hidden Markov models (HMMs) with moving-average
online adaptation is also provided, with closed-form recursions for
loglikelihood ratios, detection probabilities, and steady-state approximations,
which demonstrate significant robustness improvement over classical sequential
authentication schemes.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于AI的视觉波束跟踪算法，用于解决水-空光无线通信中因海面波动导致的信号失准问题，通过CNN-Bi-LSTM结合注意力机制来预测动态信道变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着海洋应用（如水下监视和矿产勘探）的发展，需要实时无线回传大量观测数据。窄带声学方法难以实现这一需求，而光无线通信虽具潜力，但在穿透波动海面时会产生严重的波束失准问题，需要实时收发器对准技术。

Abstract: The escalating development of oceanic applications like underwater
surveillance and mineral exploration, is motivating real-time wireless backhaul
of the considerable observation data. Such prospects can be hardly realized by
the narrowband acoustic approach. Alternatively, optical wireless communication
(OWC) has emerged as a promising solution for maritime and underwater
applications due to its great potential for broadband underwater transmission.
However, the implementations of water-air OWC can be rather challenging,
especially when penetrating the fluctuating interface, where the direction of
refracted signals changes dynamically, causing severe beam misalignment with
airborne stations. This has necessitated real-time transceiver alignment
adaptable to the sophisticated oceanic environment, which has yet to be
addressed. Against this background, this paper establishes a mathematical
channel model for water-air optical wireless transmission across the
fluctuating sea surface. Based on the model, we propose a vision-based beam
tracking algorithm that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) methods for
dynamic channel prediction. The proposed algorithm integrates a convolutional
neural network (CNN) with bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM),
which further incorporates the attention mechanism to effectively extract
critical spatio-temporal features from the vision data. The numerical
simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can outperform its
classical counterparts in maintaining receiving signal strength and supressing
the vision noises, which demonstrates its robustness against the the harsh
conditions of water-air OWC systems.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了在嵌入式传感器系统中实现实时不确定性跟踪的可行性，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案，显著优于传统的蒙特卡洛计算方法。

Abstract: Accurate characterization of sensor output uncertainty is important for
reliable data interpretation in many applications. Here, we investigate the
impact of transducer-level measurement uncertainty on overall sensor
measurement accuracy due to limited-precision information about sensor
components. We explain our method using thermopile-based sensors as an example
class of sensors. We show how sensor calibration and conversion equations,
which are an essential part of all sensing systems, propagate uncertainties
resulting from the quantization of calibration parameters, to the final,
compensated sensor output. The experimental results show that the epistemic
uncertainty of calibration-related quantities leads to absolute error in the
sensor output as high as 5.3 {\deg}C (and relative error as high as 25.7%) for
one commonly-used thermopile sensor. In one instance of using the epistemic
uncertainty information in edge detection, we show reduction of false-positives
edges to zero for the conventional Canny operator, while maintaining accuracy.
We show these ideas are practical and possible on actual embedded sensor
systems by prototyping them on two commercially-available uncertainty tracking
hardware platforms, one with average power dissipation 16.7 mW and 42.9x
speedup compared to the equal-confidence Monte Carlo computation (the status
quo), and the other with average power dissipation 147.15 mW and 94.4x speedup,
paving the way for use in real time.

TL;DR: 提出了PIRF方法，通过将物理约束作为奖励信号，直接计算轨迹级奖励并反向传播梯度，避免了传统DPS方法中的值函数近似误差，在五个PDE基准测试中实现了更好的物理约束执行效果。

Method: PIRF方法：1）计算轨迹级奖励并直接反向传播梯度；2）层级截断反向传播方法利用基于物理奖励的时空局部性；3）基于权重的正则化方案比传统蒸馏方法更高效。

Result: 在五个PDE基准测试中，PIRF在高效采样机制下始终实现优越的物理约束执行效果，展示了奖励微调在推进科学生成建模方面的潜力。

Conclusion: PIRF通过绕过值近似并直接优化轨迹级奖励，为物理感知生成提供了一个更有效和稳定的框架，在科学生成建模方面具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising
candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for
complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse
episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the
computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler
subtasks.

Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

TL;DR: FastEagle是一种非自回归级联草稿器，通过单次前向传播生成整个草稿，取代了传统草稿器的顺序依赖，在保持无损验证成本的同时实现了显著的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法（如EAGLE）需要N次顺序传递来生成N个标记，这限制了推理速度的进一步提升。FastEagle旨在通过消除草稿生成中的顺序依赖来实现更高效的推理加速。

Method: FastEagle采用非自回归级联草稿器设计，用轻量级层级联替换时间步骤，并通过层级监督训练来减轻错误累积。结合约束草稿树保持无损验证成本。

Result: 在多个LLM（Vicuna-13B、LLaMA-Instruct 3.x、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA）和任务（MT-Bench、HumanEval、GSM8K等）上，FastEagle在贪婪和随机解码下均持续优于EAGLE-3，速度提升显著，同时保持可比较的平均接受长度。

Conclusion: 消除草稿生成中的顺序依赖是实现无损LLM推理加速的实用路径，FastEagle在保持竞争性接受行为的同时提供了显著的时钟速度提升。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and
verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still
require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a
non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single
forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer
cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation.
Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification
cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong
autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.
Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM,
Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both
greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths.
These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a
practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

TL;DR: 提出了一种机器学习参数化方法(mloz)，用于在气候模型中交互式模拟臭氧变化，比传统化学方案快31倍，且可在不同气候模型间迁移使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数CMIP气候模型由于计算成本高而缺乏交互式臭氧表示，这影响了气候敏感性模拟的准确性。

Method: 开发基于机器学习的参数化方案，仅使用大气温度剖面信息作为输入，在两款不同气候模型(UKESM和ICON)中在线应用。

Result: mloz在年代际时间尺度上具有高保真度，比UKESM化学方案快31倍，仅占模型总运行时间的不到4%，且成功从UKESM迁移到ICON模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力在缺乏交互化学的CMIP级气候模型中广泛应用，特别是在关注臭氧趋势和变率对气候反馈过程影响的气候敏感性模拟中。

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important
greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of
ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes.
Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively
model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and
stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way
interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its
high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two
different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German
ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile
information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31
times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4
percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also
demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry
schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This
highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models
that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments,
particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone
trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback
processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着EEG消费设备的普及，用户隐私保护问题日益突出。研究表明EEG数据可能泄露个人身份信息，因此需要在保护隐私的同时保持数据的实用性。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的自编码器对EEG数据进行匿名化处理，在自动睡眠分期任务中评估匿名化前后数据的重识别风险和实用性。

Result: 结果表明，该方法能显著降低EEG信号的重识别性，同时保持其在机器学习任务中的实用性。

Conclusion: 提出的Transformer自编码器方法能有效保护EEG数据的隐私，同时维持其在特定应用中的使用价值。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and
has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep
stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the
potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal
information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices
raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to
safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications.
To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create
EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still
retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our
approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and
utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show
that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced
while preserving its utility for machine learning.

<details>

Motivation: 随着影响估计工具在数据估值和负责任机器学习中的广泛应用，需要探究这些评分本身是否可能被对抗性操纵。

Method: 提出了一种实用的攻击方法，通过计算输入的伪逆来产生高度记忆化的样本，仅需黑盒访问模型输出且计算开销适中。

Result: 在广泛的图像分类任务中验证了攻击效果，表明即使是最先进的代理模型也容易受到针对性评分操纵。

Conclusion: 影响估计在对抗性扰动下具有固有脆弱性，突显了基于影响的归因方法存在关键漏洞，需要开发鲁棒防御机制。

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used
to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset
curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible
machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be
adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the
feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We
characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive
queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack
(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only
black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We
empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification
tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted
score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing
conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest
the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一对比表示和时序距离框架的方法，使用拟度量表示空间结构学习最优目标到达距离，即使在次优数据和随机环境中也能工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合对比表示学习（具有稳定性和长时程能力）和拟度量网络（具有自由拼接能力）的优势，解决现有方法在拼接任务和高维噪声环境中的局限性。

Method: 使用拟度量表示空间结构（三角不等式）和额外约束学习后续表示，能够学习最优目标到达距离，即使使用次优数据。

Result: 在现有离线GCRL基准测试中，该方法在对比学习方法难以处理的拼接任务上表现更好，在拟度量网络方法难以处理的高维噪声环境中也表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法成功统一了两个框架，获得了对比学习方法的稳定性和长时程能力，以及拟度量网络的自由拼接能力，在各种环境中都表现出色。

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use
learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks
for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL
algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn
"successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over
future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric)
distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We
propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a
quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right
additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal
goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a
**quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching
distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments.
This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon
capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free
stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing
offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves
performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning
struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on
quasimetric networks struggle.

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTVAE是一个基于规则引导的多模态聚类框架，通过将领域特定约束直接嵌入到表示学习过程中，结合VAE架构、显式规则、语义表示和数据驱动特征，实现更符合领域知识的聚类结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法仅依赖输入数据的相似性，难以捕捉许多领域中关键的结构或语义约束，限制了聚类的实际应用价值。

Method: 扩展VAE架构，将LLM生成的规则结构化到知识图中，通过包含重构损失、KL散度、一致性惩罚和违规惩罚的损失函数来强制约束合规性。

Result: 在飞机和汽车数据集上的实验表明，规则引导的聚类产生了更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类结果（如分离无人机、统一隐形飞机、区分SUV和轿车），同时提升了传统聚类指标。

Conclusion: DARTVAE通过结合规则编码和学习表示，比纯数据驱动模型实现了更有意义和一致的聚类结果，展示了约束引导多模态聚类在复杂知识密集型场景中的实用性，但也面临LLM规则生成幻觉、规则冲突、过拟合和计算复杂性等挑战。

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

Motivation: 传统注意力层参数依赖于输入元素的成对交互，在没有结构假设的情况下，内存和计算复杂度随序列长度呈二次方增长。现有方法要么引入稀疏性忽略部分交互，要么引入循环依赖，但两者都有缺点。

Method: 基于树结构矩阵的高效求逆技术，将稀疏注意力和状态空间模型的优势结合起来。

Result: 提出了一种新颖的算法，能够有效缓解注意力机制中的二次复杂度问题。

Conclusion: 该算法为处理长序列提供了一种更高效的解决方案，结合了两种主流方法的优点。

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend
on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any
structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the
sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity
by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce
recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are
reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that
combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient
inversion of tree-structured matrices.

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent
full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to
predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given
microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By
sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent
predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage
progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the
damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed
shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture
demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on
the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load
traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain
insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape,
size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness.
Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved
durability and reduced internal damage.

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统策略梯度方法使用熵最大化来平衡探索与利用，但最大熵会使策略趋向均匀随机分布，这种无结构的探索策略有时效率低下

Method: 引入复杂度作为正则项，定义为香农熵与不平衡度的乘积，其中不平衡度衡量与均匀分布的距离。基于PPO算法开发了CDPO算法

Result: 在多个离散动作空间任务上的实验表明，CDPO对复杂度系数的选择比PPO对熵系数的选择更鲁棒，特别是在需要更多探索的环境中表现更好

Conclusion: 复杂度正则项能够鼓励策略在随机性和结构化之间取得平衡，引导智能体发现有用且非平凡的行为模式

Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via
entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a
uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

Conclusion: 建议在实际应用中使用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化等方法来辅助维度约简和超参数选择，以确保贝叶斯神经网络能够提供准确的不确定性量化。

Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use
without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may
be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in
neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an
accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining
accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for
practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of
hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional
NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the
effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity
analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results
indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect
both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world
applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods
such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality
reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical
systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential
for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior
efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed
as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for
discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an
open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on
dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential
equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying
levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy,
model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging
PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations
in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic
programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs,
respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise.
MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a
rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of
dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and
improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

Motivation: 在对称性丰富的场景中，仅基于原始特征间成对几何距离的最优传输对齐可能忽略数据的内在相干结构。

Method: 引入双谱最优传输，使用双谱（一种群傅里叶不变量）来表示元素，该表示在去除群动作引起的变异的同时保留所有信号结构。

Conclusion: 双谱最优传输能够提高有意义对应关系的质量，捕捉数据集中潜在的语义标签结构，同时去除不影响类别或内容的冗余变异。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

### [29] [Scaling Laws are Redundancy Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20721)
*Yuda Bi,Vince D Calhoun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过核回归分析，揭示了缩放定律本质上是冗余定律，证明了模型性能随规模增长的幂律改进源于数据协方差谱的多项式尾部，其中缩放指数α=2s/(2s+1/β)取决于数据冗余度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中缩放定律普遍存在，但数学起源特别是缩放指数的理论解释仍然缺失，需要从数学上解释为什么模型性能会随数据集和模型规模呈幂律改进。

Method: 使用核回归方法分析数据协方差谱的多项式尾部特性，推导出超额风险的幂律表达式，并在有界可逆变换、多模态混合、有限宽度近似和Transformer架构等多种场景下验证该定律的普适性。

Result: 建立了缩放指数的数学表达式α=2s/(2s+1/β)，其中β控制谱尾部特性，1/β衡量数据冗余度，发现学习曲线的斜率不是普适的而是依赖于数据冗余度，更陡的谱会加速规模收益。

Conclusion: 本文首次为缩放定律提供了严格的数学解释，将其解释为有限样本冗余定律，统一了经验观察与理论基础，揭示了数据冗余在深度学习缩放中的核心作用。

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking
power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model
size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have
remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally
explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a
polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law
with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail
and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is
not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating
returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly
invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations,
and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning
regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of
scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations
with theoretical foundations.

*Athar Parvez,Muhammad Jawad Mufti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究比较了两种混合机器学习分类器（XGBoost+随机森林 vs SVM+逻辑回归）在糖尿病风险分层中的表现，并在外部数据集上验证了其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球糖尿病患者数量庞大且持续增长，早期风险分层对糖尿病管理至关重要。机器学习方法可以改善风险预测，但需要验证其泛化能力。

Method: 构建了两种混合分类器：XGB-RF和SVM-LR，采用防泄漏的标准化流程（编码、插补、缩放、SMOTE过采样、概率校准），在主要数据集上训练后冻结模型，在PIMA外部队列上进行验证。

Result: XGB-RF在主要数据集上表现优异（AUROC 0.995，AUPRC 0.998），在外部验证中保持强劲性能（AUROC 0.990，AUPRC 0.959），明显优于SVM-LR。

Conclusion: XGB-RF在内部和外部验证中均优于SVM-LR，表现出更好的泛化能力和可接受的校准性能，支持基于梯度提升的混合方法作为糖尿病风险分层的稳健可转移策略。

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is
projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit
from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their
generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and
(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,
standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training
folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and
frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination
(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation
used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics
on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC
~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On
PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;
AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded
metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;
Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall
0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently
dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with
acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based
hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk
stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with
deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在截断伊辛模型中仅使用单个样本估计逆温度参数的问题，这是对传统需要多个样本的统计估计方法的挑战。

Method: 基于伪似然最大化的方法，扩展了Daskalakis等人的技术来处理截断伊辛模型的更复杂设置。

Result: 设计了一个在近O(n)时间内运行的估计器，该估计器在k ≳ log(d²k)Δ³条件下与真实参数β*具有O(Δ³/√n)一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了在截断伊辛模型中仅用单个样本估计逆温度参数的挑战，为高维统计推断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$
of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a
graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability
distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each
configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S
\subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto
\exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency
matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where
the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated
Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded
degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$
that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for
$k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion
that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without
[Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA
'24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC
'19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the
truncated Ising model.

*Zhengkang Guan,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出E-CIT框架，通过数据分区和p值聚合显著降低条件独立性测试的计算复杂度，使因果发现更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于约束的因果发现依赖大量条件独立性测试，计算成本过高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用分治策略：将数据分区，在每个子集上应用基础CIT，然后使用基于稳定分布特性的新方法聚合p值。

Result: E-CIT将基础CIT的计算复杂度降低到样本大小的线性级别，在保持性能的同时显著减少计算负担。

Conclusion: E-CIT是一个通用即插即用框架，能有效解决因果发现中的计算瓶颈问题，在复杂测试场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

*Lars van der Laan,Nathan Kallus,Aurélien Bibaut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的逆强化学习方法，将IRL简化为两个现成的监督学习问题：概率分类估计行为策略，以及迭代回归求解固定点方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的最大熵IRL方法通常涉及复杂的内循环优化、重复动态规划或对抗训练，这限制了现代高表达能力函数逼近器（如神经网络）的使用。本文旨在简化IRL流程。

Method: 通过分析发现，softmax IRL的总体最大似然解可由涉及行为策略的线性固定点方程表征，从而将IRL分解为两个监督学习任务：概率分类和迭代回归。

Result: 该方法简单模块化，适用于各种函数逼近类别和算法，提供了最优解的精确表征、基于oracle的通用算法、有限样本误差界，并在实验中表现出与MaxEnt IRL相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法显著简化了逆强化学习流程，使其更容易与现代函数逼近器结合使用，同时保持了竞争性的性能表现。

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by
uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or
Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function
and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency
condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this
perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and
understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often
involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or
adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly
expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit
softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is
characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy.
This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems:
probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative
regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular
across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise
characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm,
finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or
superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

Motivation: 尽管快速多极子方法在物理和工程领域广泛应用，但其与现代机器学习架构的集成仍未被充分探索。

Method: 利用FMM方法的分层计算流程来分离局部和远场相互作用，并有效学习它们各自的表示。

Result: 开发了Neural FMM架构，该架构整合了FMM的信息流到分层机器学习框架中。

Conclusion: Neural FMM为学习椭圆偏微分方程的格林算子提供了一种有效的分层机器学习方法。

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for
computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and
electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's
function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread
application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern
machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose
a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the
information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for
learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture
leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the
local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective
representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and
minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability
characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert
\widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray
analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of
null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a
data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal
threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s
which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the
family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one
picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By
calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective
$p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically
that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge
between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p}
\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend
sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

Motivation: 传统黑盒方法无法捕捉视频流服务中不同特征与用户体验之间的复杂关系，且缺乏可解释性。

Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) modeling is crucial for optimizing video
streaming services to capture the complex relationships between different
features and user experience. We propose a novel approach to QoE modeling in
video streaming applications using interpretable Machine Learning (ML)
techniques over raw time series data. Unlike traditional black-box approaches,
our method combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an interpretable

evaluate our method on popular datasets and demonstrate its enhanced accuracy

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了神经网络训练数据重建攻击的局限性，证明在没有先验知识的情况下存在无限多远离真实训练集的替代解，重建本质上不可靠。有趣的是，训练更充分的网络虽然满足隐式偏差条件更强，但实际更不容易受到重建攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络对训练数据的记忆化引发了隐私和安全担忧，现有重建方法虽然在某些条件下能重建部分训练数据，但其可靠性和理论基础尚不明确。本文旨在分析现有重建方法的固有弱点和局限性。

Method: 从理论角度分析重建方法的局限性，严格证明在没有数据先验知识的情况下存在无限多替代解；通过实证研究验证精确复制训练样本仅是偶然现象；比较不同训练程度的网络对重建攻击的抵抗力。

Result: 理论证明重建本质上不可靠，存在无限多远离真实训练集的替代解；实证显示精确复制训练样本仅偶然发生；训练更充分的网络反而更不容易受到重建攻击。

Conclusion: 重建攻击的可靠性被高估，训练更充分的网络在满足更强隐式偏差条件的同时反而具有更好的隐私保护能力，这为在保持强泛化能力的同时缓解重建攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经SDE求解器的反向传播存在两难：离散化后优化方法梯度准确但内存成本高；优化后离散化方法内存成本低但梯度近似误差大。代数可逆求解器虽然承诺内存效率和梯度准确性，但现有方法如可逆Heun方案在复杂模型和大步长下不稳定。

Method: 引入了一类新的显式且有效对称（EES）Runge-Kutta方案，这些方案保留了可逆求解器的优点，同时克服了它们的不稳定性，能够在没有严格步长或模型复杂度限制的情况下实现内存高效训练。

Result: 通过数值实验证明，EES方案具有优越的稳定性和可靠性，为神经SDE的可扩展和准确训练提供了实用基础。

Conclusion: EES方案解决了神经SDE训练中的内存效率和梯度准确性之间的权衡问题，为大规模神经SDE训练提供了稳定可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in
two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs
prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when
mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves
constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from
slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible
solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing
methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex
models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a
novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs.
These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of
reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling
memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model
complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical
foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis
functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of
functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to
feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner
product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains
their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the
intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural
models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that
learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows
bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient
alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal
the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive
finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes
techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a
polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear
dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital
model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially
fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with
kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and
principled at scale.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互信息是衡量随机变量关系的重要指标，但复杂系统中的互信息估计具有挑战性。去噪扩散模型在密度估计方面表现出色，因此探索其是否也能改进互信息估计。

Method: 利用去噪扩散模型的信息论公式，将互信息表示为条件和非条件扩散的最小均方误差差距的一半，在所有信噪比上进行积分，并采用自适应重要性采样实现可扩展估计。

Result: 该方法通过了自一致性测试，在性能上超越了传统和基于分数的扩散互信息估计器，即使在高互信息情况下也能保持良好性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型提供了一种直接且有效的互信息估计方法，结合自适应重要性采样实现了可扩展的高性能估计。

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

Conclusion: SIL-C框架有效解决了技能增量学习中技能与策略兼容性问题，实现了技能改进对下游策略性能的增强，无需策略重新训练。

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

TL;DR: Latent Twins是一个统一的数学框架，通过在潜在空间中创建隐藏代理来模拟底层方程，将表示学习和算法解决方案方法统一起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学机器学习在过去十年中取得了显著进展，但表示学习和算法解决方案方法往往并行发展，缺乏统一的框架。

Method: 提出Latent Twins框架，在学习的潜在空间中创建数学系统的镜像，该空间由算子控制，将经典建模、反演、模型约简和算子逼近统一为单一原则。

Result: 建立了Latent Twins对ODE和PDE的基本逼近性质，在三个代表性设置中进行了验证：典型ODE、浅水方程PDE基准测试和真实数据地电位再分析数据集。

Conclusion: Latent Twins提供了一个紧凑、可解释的解决方案算子代理，能够在单次评估中跨越任意时间间隔，同时与科学流程兼容，为跨学科的数据驱动表示学习和经典科学建模提供了可扩展的理论基础代理。

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the
development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing,
modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical
PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the
boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in
parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods
evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a
unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space
for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in
the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent
space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,
model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a
single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of
Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three
representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical
regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting
Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and
(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing
and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a
compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across
arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with
scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty
quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,
theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and
classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

TL;DR: 提出PFedDL框架，通过联邦字典学习解决多站点fMRI数据隐私和异质性挑战，将站点特定字典分解为共享全局组件和个性化本地组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据隐私约束和多站点fMRI研究的站点特异性异质性导致非IID数据，阻碍了通用模型的开发。

Method: 在每个站点执行独立的字典学习，将站点特定字典分解为共享全局组件和个性化本地组件，通过联邦聚合更新全局原子，独立优化本地原子。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集上的实验表明，PFedDL在非IID数据集上的准确性和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PFedDL框架有效解决了多站点fMRI分析中的数据隐私和异质性挑战，提高了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about
music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using
textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this
issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We
adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley
values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's
prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that
the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but
further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low,
models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not
entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs
and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in
explainable AI and audio.

Motivation: 现有好奇心机制将环境随机性与有意义的新颖性混淆，且忽视同伴行为新颖性，导致在去中心化、无通信的多智能体强化学习中探索效果不佳。

Method: CERMIC框架让智能体能够过滤噪声惊喜信号，通过推断多智能体上下文动态校准内在好奇心，并生成理论上有依据的内在奖励来鼓励高信息增益的状态转换探索。

Result: 在VMAS、Meltingpot和SMACv2等基准测试中，使用CERMIC的探索方法在稀疏奖励环境中显著优于最先进算法。

Conclusion: CERMIC通过结合多智能体上下文和理论驱动的好奇心校准，有效解决了多智能体强化学习中的探索挑战，为稀疏奖励环境提供了强大的探索机制。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在超级计算机上运行昂贵化学计算时面临的两个关键问题：如何找到最短执行时间的参数配置，以及如何最小化资源使用成本。

Method: 使用梯度提升（GB）机器学习模型和主动学习策略，基于CCSD应用在DOE Frontier和Aurora超级计算机上的运行数据，预测执行时间和优化节点数、tile大小等参数。

Result: 在预测CCSD迭代总执行时间时，梯度提升模型在Aurora和Frontier上的平均绝对百分比误差分别为0.023和0.073。主动学习策略仅需约450个实验数据就能达到约0.2的MAPE。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够有效预测化学计算资源需求，梯度提升模型表现优异，主动学习策略在数据收集成本高的情况下仍能提供良好预测精度。

Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from
Aurora and Frontier.

TL;DR: 本文建立了上下文学习(ICL)稳定性的非渐近下界，揭示了最小演示样本数与ICL稳定性之间的关系，并提出了一种无需分布先验的可计算准则来估计合适的提示长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习虽然灵活，但其可靠性对提示长度高度敏感，需要理论指导来确定稳定的演示样本数量。

Method: 基于固定高维亚高斯表示建立ICL稳定性的非渐近下界，提出两阶段可观测估计器，通过一次性校准产生实用的提示长度估计。

Result: 实验表明预测阈值与经验拐点高度一致，理论边界作为保守但可靠的上界，校准版本进一步缩小了差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果将谱覆盖与稳定ICL联系起来，弥合了理论与部署之间的差距，提高了大规模提示在有限样本机制下的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive
to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that
links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed
high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit
sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance,
providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we
propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that
produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional
priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show
close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points,
with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the
calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral
coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the
interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic
finite-sample regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织间协作微调LLM具有吸引力，但数据隐私顾虑阻碍了集中式训练。联邦学习作为隐私保护框架被认为能解决此问题，但作者发现FL仍存在隐私泄露风险。

Method: 通过大量实验验证FL框架下LLM微调的隐私泄露问题，使用简单的生成方法提取训练数据，并提出跟踪全局模型更新的增强攻击策略。同时评估了差分隐私、正则化约束更新和安全对齐LLM等隐私保护技术。

Result: 实验表明攻击者可以从FL训练的全局模型中提取训练数据，且模型规模越大泄露越严重。提出的增强攻击策略能进一步加剧隐私泄露。隐私保护技术能有效降低风险。

Conclusion: FL框架下微调LLM仍存在显著的隐私泄露风险，需要采用适当的隐私保护技术来降低风险，为实际应用提供了有价值的指导。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法通常通过简单拼接融合配体和蛋白质表示，缺乏明确的几何正则化，导致在化学空间和时间上的泛化能力较差。

Method: 使用特征线性调制层将分子嵌入条件化于蛋白质嵌入，通过三元组损失强制度量结构，采用RBF回归头在嵌入距离上产生平滑可解释的亲和力预测。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein
representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric
regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and
time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular
embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation
(FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF
regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable
affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark,
as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation.
Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust
drug-target affinity prediction.

Motivation: 现有PPO及其变体在训练过程中会丢弃低概率token的梯度信号，但这些被裁剪的token在调节熵动态中起着关键作用。

Method: 提出CE-GPPO算法，以温和且有界的方式重新引入被PPO裁剪的token的梯度，通过控制裁剪区间外token的梯度幅度来实现探索-利用平衡。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，CE-GPPO在不同模型规模下均一致优于强基线方法，有效缓解了熵不稳定性问题。

Conclusion: CE-GPPO通过保留被裁剪token的梯度信号，能够更好地控制策略熵，在强化学习优化大语言模型方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

Motivation: 虽然反欺骗系统对保护语音应用安全至关重要，但广泛使用的音频水印（原本用于版权保护）对其影响尚未被充分研究。

Method: 构建水印增强的训练和评估数据集Watermark-Spoofing，应用多种手工和神经网络水印方法，并提出知识保持水印学习（KPWL）框架。

Result: 水印持续降低反欺骗性能，水印密度越高，等错误率（EER）越高。KPWL框架使模型能够适应水印引起的域偏移，同时保持原始域欺骗检测能力。

Conclusion: 音频水印是一个被忽视的域偏移因素，本研究为开发水印弹性反欺骗系统建立了首个基准。

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on
spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for
securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio
watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely
unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets,
named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and
neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments
show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with
higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To
mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL)
framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while
preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings
reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish
the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

TL;DR: 本文对Transformer-based表格数据合成工具进行超参数敏感性评估，发现浅层配置运行更快，GReaT运行时间更短，但在大数据集上REaLTabFormer能保持更好的数据质量和相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based模型在表格数据合成中表现优异但计算成本高，需要评估超参数选择对合成数据质量和计算性能的影响。

Method: 使用GReaT和REaLTabFormer两个工具，评估10种不同架构类型和深度的模型设置，从运行时间、机器学习效用和与真实数据分布相似性三个维度进行分析，在四个真实世界数据集上进行实验。

Result: 运行时间与超参数数量成正比，浅层配置完成更快；GReaT运行时间始终低于REaLTabFormer；小数据集上两个工具都能获得高质量合成数据，但大数据集上只有REaLTabFormer能保持强效用和相似性。

Conclusion: REaLTabFormer与轻量级LLMs结合提供了最佳平衡，能在保持数据质量的同时降低计算需求，但其运行时间仍高于GReaT和其他TDS工具，表明效率提升存在上限。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

TL;DR: Sig2Model是一个高效的自适应学习索引，通过sigmoid增强近似、主动更新训练和神经联合优化框架，显著降低了动态更新时的重训练成本，提高了查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习索引在静态数据集上表现优异，但在动态更新时性能下降，因为维护CDF不变性需要全局模型重训练，这会阻塞查询并限制QPS。现有方法未能有效解决重训练成本问题。

Method: 1) sigmoid增强近似技术：通过局部sigmoid函数近似数据分布变化，推迟完整重训练；2) 基于高斯混合模型的主动更新训练：识别高更新概率区域进行策略性占位符分配；3) 神经联合优化框架：通过梯度学习持续优化sigmoid集成和GMM参数。

Result: 与最先进的可更新学习索引相比，Sig2Model将重训练成本降低高达20倍，QPS提高高达3倍，内存使用减少高达1000倍。

Conclusion: Sig2Model通过创新的技术组合有效解决了学习索引在动态更新环境中的性能问题，为实际工作负载提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index
structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable
efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic
updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global
model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)
metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,
rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In
this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that
minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting
approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by
approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid
functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full
retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder
allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework
that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via
gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art
updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that
Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,
and uses up to 1000x less memory.

Conclusion: 通过结合MLP的长期趋势建模能力和CNN的局部模式捕捉能力，提出的混合模型能有效处理非平稳时间序列数据，在多变量时间序列预测任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive

*Abhishek Moturu,Anna Goldenberg,Babak Taati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LiLAW是一种轻量级自适应加权方法，通过三个可学习参数动态调整训练样本的损失权重，根据样本难度（简单、中等、困难）优先处理信息丰富的样本，无需大量超参数调优或干净验证集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在存在噪声标签和数据异质性的情况下训练深度神经网络是一个重大挑战，需要能够动态适应样本难度的方法来提高模型鲁棒性。

Method: 使用三个可学习参数，在每个训练小批量后通过验证集上的单步梯度下降更新样本权重，根据样本难度动态调整损失权重。

Result: 在多个通用和医学影像数据集、不同噪声水平和类型、损失函数及架构上的广泛实验表明，LiLAW能持续提升性能，即使在高噪声环境下也有效。

Conclusion: LiLAW提供了一种计算高效的解决方案，可在任何神经网络训练设置中增强模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性，无需过度依赖数据增强或高级正则化。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data
heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive
Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of
each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as
easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW
adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating
these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation
set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter
tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general
and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and
architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently
enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without
heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting
its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model
generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

*Qiyu Chen,Guozhang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了任务依赖初始化(TDI)框架，通过功率谱匹配将状态空间模型的归纳偏置与任务的光谱特征对齐，显著提升模型在低数据情况下的泛化能力和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型的成功依赖于扩展定律，但高质量数据的有限性带来了挑战。现有状态空间模型使用固定的归纳偏置，当任务结构与模型偏置不匹配时会导致样本效率低下。

Method: 首先形式化线性时不变SSM的归纳偏置，提出任务依赖初始化方法，通过功率谱匹配在训练前将模型偏置与任务光谱特征对齐。

Result: 在多样化真实世界基准测试中，TDI显著改善了泛化能力和样本效率，特别是在低数据情况下效果明显。

Conclusion: 这项工作为创建更数据高效的模型提供了理论和实践工具，是实现可持续扩展的关键步骤。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

*Zhengxiao Li,Liming Lu,Xu Zheng,Siyuan Liang,Zhenghan Chen,Yongbin Zhou,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了FERD框架，首次在数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏中解决鲁棒公平性问题，通过调整对抗样本的比例和分布来提升最差类别鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏方法忽视了鲁棒公平性问题，导致不同类别间的鲁棒性存在严重差异，学生模型在不同攻击目标下的鲁棒性不稳定。

Method: FERD采用鲁棒性引导的类别重加权策略调整样本比例，生成公平感知样本(FAEs)和统一目标对抗样本(UTAEs)来平衡特征表示和攻击目标分布。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，FERD在所有对抗攻击下实现了最先进的最差类别鲁棒性（如在CIFAR-10上使用MobileNet-V2，FGSM和AutoAttack下的最差类别鲁棒性分别提升了15.1%和6.4%）。

Conclusion: FERD框架在鲁棒性和公平性方面都表现出优越性能，有效解决了数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏中的鲁棒公平性问题。

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

*Hwa Hui Tew,Junn Yong Loo,Yee-Fan Tan,Xinyu Tang,Hernando Ombao,Fuad Noman,Raphael C. -W. Phan,Chee-Ming Ting*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2I-Diff是一个fMRI生成框架，通过时频表示和去噪扩散模型生成高质量的BOLD信号，解决了传统生成模型忽略BOLD信号非平稳性和非线性动态的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI数据采集资源密集，高质量样本稀缺，而现有生成模型因忽略BOLD信号的复杂动态特性而表现不佳。

Method: 将BOLD信号通过时变傅里叶变换转换为窗口化频谱图，使用无分类器去噪扩散模型生成类条件频谱图，再通过逆傅里叶变换还原为BOLD信号。

Result: 该方法在下游fMRI脑网络分类任务中展现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T2I-Diff框架通过结合时频分析和扩散模型，有效提升了fMRI数据的生成质量，为数据驱动的脑分析提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging
method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic
changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the
resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of
high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While
modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform
because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.
To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation
framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and
classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts
BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,
capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.
Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate
class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD
signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of
our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in
downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

*Luca Zhou,Pratham Yashwante,Marshall Fisher,Alessio Sampieri,Zihao Zhou,Fabio Galasso,Rose Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaTS-Bench是第一个大规模、真实世界的情境感知时间序列字幕生成基准，包含465k训练和105k测试时间戳，结合数值序列、元数据、线图图像和字幕，并提供了460个多选题来评估时间序列推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列字幕生成基准通常依赖合成数据或过于简化的字幕，且忽视元数据和视觉表示，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 从11个多样化数据集重构为字幕生成和问答任务，使用可扩展的流水线生成参考字幕（主要由oracle LLM生成并通过事实检查、人类不可区分性研究和多样性分析验证），并提供579个人工修订的测试字幕。

Result: 提出了新的定制评估指标，并对领先的视觉语言模型进行基准测试，展示了它们的优势和持续局限性。

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench及其字幕生成流水线为时间序列分析与基础模型交叉研究的未来提供了一个可靠且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络训练动态中的后期现象（如grokking和信息瓶颈）机制及其关系尚不清楚，需要统一的理论解释。

Method: 通过神经坍缩视角分析学习表示的几何特性，研究类内方差收缩动态，并验证训练集拟合与神经坍缩进展的时间尺度差异。

Result: 发现类内方差收缩是grokking和信息瓶颈现象的关键因素，神经坍缩动态解释了这些后期现象的行为模式。

Conclusion: 神经坍缩为深度学习中的后期训练现象提供了统一的理论框架，揭示了类内方差收缩和时间尺度差异的核心作用。

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even
as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent
examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the
training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where
models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction
task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a
unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural
collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show
that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor
underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to
the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the
dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting
the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the
behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出两阶段训练框架解决多模态融合中的模态竞争问题，通过单模态预训练塑造初始状态，使用有效竞争强度(ECS)理论分析和FastPID信息分解方法实现模态平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合中常出现模态竞争问题，一个模态主导学习过程导致其他模态优化不足。现有方法多在联合学习阶段解决此问题，忽视了模型初始状态的关键影响。

Method: 两阶段训练框架：1) 单模态预训练塑造初始状态；2) 提出ECS概念量化模态竞争强度，使用互信息作为ECS代理，开发FastPID进行部分信息分解，测量模态特异性、冗余性和协同性；3) 异步控制器动态平衡模态并定位理想初始状态。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明该方法能有效缓解模态竞争，实现协同多模态融合。

Conclusion: 塑造预融合模型的初始状态是缓解模态竞争的有效策略，能够在竞争开始前就实现协同多模态融合。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint
training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others
under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,
most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In
this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial
states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose
the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's
competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly
shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error
bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To
bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a
fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training
controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a
principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals
and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a
computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information
decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into
fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and
synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically
balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial
state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a
powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking
synergistic multi-modal fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多组学数据能够捕捉复杂的生物分子相互作用，但缺失的模态阻碍了异质组学数据的综合分析。

Method: MOIRA采用早期集成方法，将每个组学数据集投影到共享嵌入空间，通过可学习的加权机制融合它们，利用包括缺失模态在内的所有样本。

Result: 在ROSMAP阿尔茨海默病数据集上，MOIRA优于现有方法，特征重要性分析揭示了与先前文献一致的AD相关生物标志物。

Conclusion: MOIRA方法在生物相关性方面表现出色，能够有效处理不完整的多组学数据集成问题。

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide
insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder
integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)
dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches,
and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior
literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

Motivation: 现有条件时间序列生成模型只学习观测相关性，未考虑未观测混杂因素，缺乏因果推理能力。需要从因果视角重新思考条件TSG，支持干预和反事实推理。

Method: 开发CaTSG框架，基于扩散模型，通过后门调整推导因果得分函数，使用溯因-行动-预测过程实现反事实生成，统一支持观测、干预和反事实三个层次的生成。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，CaTSG在保真度上表现优异，并能处理现有基线无法支持的干预和反事实生成任务。

Conclusion: 提出了因果TSG任务家族并通过CaTSG实现，为在干预和反事实场景下实现更可靠的模拟提供了初步概念验证，开辟了有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.

Motivation: 约10%的新生儿需要呼吸辅助，5%需要通气支持。可穿戴FHR监测器在产妇活动时易出现信号丢失，传统插值方法无法保持信号频谱特征，限制了AI分析。

Method: 使用掩码变换器自编码器方法重建缺失的FHR信号，能够同时捕捉数据的空间和频率特征。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于回顾性研究数据集支持AI风险算法开发，未来可集成到可穿戴FHR监测设备中实现更早更稳健的风险检测。

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的效果受推理策略影响很大，但推理风格、模型架构和任务类型之间的相互作用仍不明确，需要系统评估。

Method: 引入StyleBench基准，评估5种代表性推理风格（CoT、ToT、AoT、SoT、CoD）在5个推理任务上，使用15个开源模型（270M-120B参数）。

Result: 搜索类方法（AoT、ToT）在开放性问题中表现优异但需要大模型，简洁风格（SoT、CoD）在定义明确任务上效率极高；小模型常无法遵循输出指令而猜测，推理鲁棒性随规模增加。

Conclusion: 推理策略选择应根据具体约束条件，没有通用最优方案，为基于约束选择最优推理策略提供了关键路线图。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in
https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中经常出现延迟，但标准强化学习算法通常假设环境感知是瞬时的。论文针对POMDP中观察可能乱序到达的随机传感器延迟问题进行研究，这是RL中尚未解决的问题。

Method: 提出基于模型的过滤过程，基于传入的观察流顺序更新信念状态，然后将这一思想整合到基于模型的RL中，形成一个简单的延迟感知框架，并在Dreamer中应用该方法。

Result: 该方法在延迟感知基线方法上表现一致更优，并在部署期间对延迟分布变化表现出鲁棒性。在模拟机器人任务实验中，相比常见实用启发式方法也表现更好。

Conclusion: 明确建模观察延迟的重要性得到强调，提出的延迟感知框架能够有效处理随机传感器延迟问题。

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of
the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations
may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端间的数据不平衡会降低共享模型的性能，需要改进客户端选择方法来减轻这种负面影响。

Method: 扩展现有联邦学习策略，选择能够使当前标签分布与目标分布（平衡分布或联邦组合标签分布）对齐的活跃客户端。

Result: 在三种常见联邦学习策略和两个数据集上的实验表明，面对局部不平衡时，与平衡分布对齐效果最好；面对全局不平衡时，与联邦组合标签分布对齐更优。

Conclusion: 提出的分布控制客户端选择方法能有效改善联邦学习中的数据不平衡问题，不同目标分布适用于不同类型的平衡问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data
privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy
requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the
success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To
address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL
strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the
detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension
to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the
current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a
balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.
Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our
distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two
datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a
balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance,
alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for
global imbalance.

*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于联邦学习和注意力增强LSTM的败血症发病预测模型，支持可变预测时间窗口，在多中心ICU数据上训练，在保护隐私的同时提高了早期预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 败血症早期准确预测在重症监护中至关重要，但单个医院数据有限且机器学习模型受限于数据多样性。联邦学习可解决数据共享的隐私问题，实现跨机构协作训练。

Method: 使用联邦学习框架，结合注意力增强的长短期记忆网络模型，支持可变预测时间窗口，可在单一统一模型中实现短期和长期预测。

Result: 联邦学习不仅提高了整体预测性能（接近集中式模型），而且特别有利于败血症早期发病预测。可变预测窗口不会显著降低性能，但减少了计算、通信和组织开销。

Conclusion: 所提出的联邦学习模型在保护隐私的同时有效提高了败血症早期预测能力，可变预测窗口设计在保持性能的同时降低了系统开销。

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于马尔可夫链的确定性去噪算法，用于离散状态扩散模型，通过引入具有弱混沌动态的herding算法变体来实现确定性离散状态转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离散扩散模型使用随机去噪过程，本文旨在开发一种确定性替代方法，既不需要重新训练也不需要连续状态嵌入。

Method: 使用基于马尔可夫链的确定性去噪算法，引入herding算法的变体，通过弱混沌动态诱导确定性离散状态转换。

Result: 在文本和图像生成任务中，效率和样本质量都得到了一致性提升。

Conclusion: 这种简单的去随机化方法有望增强离散扩散在生成建模中的重要性，并证明确定性反向过程在离散状态空间中同样有效。

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion
models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized
by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics,
which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a
direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither
retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent
improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation
tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the
significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our
results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in
continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

TL;DR: 开发了一个深度学习框架，结合微观流动性特征、历史犯罪和社会人口统计数据，在精细时空分辨率下预测犯罪，结果显示流动性特征显著提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在精细时空分辨率下，结合微观流动性特征、历史犯罪和社会人口统计数据是否能提升犯罪预测性能。

Method: 使用四个美国城市的犯罪事件数据、社会人口调查数据和人类流动性数据，构建ConvLSTM网络模型，预测12小时后的犯罪发生，并与逻辑回归、随机森林和标准LSTM等基线模型比较。

Result: 结合流动性特征提升了预测性能，特别是使用较短输入序列时。深度学习模型在所有四个城市中均获得最高的召回率、精确率和F1分数，长序列对暴力犯罪预测更有效，短序列对财产犯罪更有效。

Conclusion: 强调了整合多样化数据源（包括流动性数据）对时空犯罪预测的重要性，并凸显了深度学习在处理精细时空尺度时的优势和局限性。

Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.
miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高重型土方设备中线性执行器的能效，减少能量损失和环境影响。

Method: 使用MATLAB/Simulink仿真比较PDCV和PFCV两种液压回路，PFCV通过在执行器两端之间引入人工泄漏来减少能量损失，采用模糊控制器调谐的PID控制器进行位置控制。

Result: PFCV液压回路比传统PDCV回路能效提高8.5%，有效减少了能量损失。

Conclusion: 提出的PFCV方法可显著提高重型土方设备线性执行器的能效，降低环境影响和运营成本。

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators
used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation
equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency,
with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and
the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve
(PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV
reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the
pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.
The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than
theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position
control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a
fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using
MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the
proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy
efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment,
therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenFacts是一个基于类别判别变分自编码器的生成框架，用于为多元时间序列生成反事实解释。它通过对比学习和分类一致性目标、基于原型的初始化以及真实性约束优化，在雷达手势数据和手写字母轨迹数据上实现了比现有方法更高的合理性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法为多元时间序列生成的反事实解释往往无效、不合理或难以理解，需要开发能够产生更合理和用户可理解的反事实解释的方法。

Method: 基于类别判别变分自编码器的生成框架，整合了对比学习和分类一致性目标、基于原型的初始化方法以及真实性约束优化策略。

Result: 在两个数据集上，GenFacts在合理性方面比最先进基线方法提高了18.7%，在人类研究中获得了最高的可解释性评分。

Conclusion: 对于时间序列数据的可操作反事实解释，合理性和以用户为中心的可解释性比稀疏性更重要。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现Transformer在时间序列预测中表现不佳，甚至不如简单线性模型，主要原因是注意力机制失效，Transformer块退化为简单MLP，当前嵌入方法无法让Transformer在良好结构化的潜在空间中工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer在NLP和CV领域表现出色，但在时间序列预测中表现不佳，甚至不如简单线性基线，需要深入探究Transformer失败的原因。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，逐步将Transformer修改为MLP来研究注意力机制的影响；设计了可解释的数据集来研究注意力机制失效的原因；进行了理论分析。

Result: 发现现有时间序列Transformer中的Transformer块经常退化为简单MLP；注意力机制没有按预期方式工作；当前嵌入方法无法让Transformer在良好结构化的潜在空间中工作。

Conclusion: Transformer在时间序列预测中的失败主要源于注意力机制失效和嵌入方法的问题，需要重新思考时间序列Transformer的设计。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not
demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform
simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not
thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better
understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments,
progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the
attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into
simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable
dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention
mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the
expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon,
demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to
function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper
underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出解耦值注意力(DVA)机制，改进先验数据拟合网络(PFNs)在高维回归任务中的性能，使其在保持高斯过程更新特性的同时实现80倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer注意力在PFNs中对高维回归任务效果有限，需要改进注意力机制来提升性能。

Method: 引入DVA机制，从输入计算相似度，仅通过值传播标签，镜像高斯过程更新但无需核函数。

Result: 在5维和10维情况下验证损失减少超过50%，64维电力流方程近似平均绝对误差达1E-3量级，比精确GP推理快80倍以上。

Conclusion: 注意力规则而非架构本身是扩展PFNs的关键因素，CNN-based PFNs能达到与Transformer-based PFNs相当的性能。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to
time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of
physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by
replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned
prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show
limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce
Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the
function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the
predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes
similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.
Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining
kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the
attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample
validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation
loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the
role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,
showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based
counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation
approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being
over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

TL;DR: Flow matching在低噪声区域存在不稳定性问题，称为低噪声病理。本文提出Local Contrastive Flow (LCF)方法，通过在小噪声水平使用对比特征对齐替代直接速度回归来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现Flow matching框架在低噪声区域存在基本不稳定性，当噪声水平接近零时，输入的微小扰动会导致速度目标的大幅变化，使学习问题的条件数发散，影响优化速度和语义表示质量。

Method: 提出Local Contrastive Flow (LCF)，一种混合训练协议：在小噪声水平使用对比特征对齐替代直接速度回归，在中高噪声水平保留标准Flow matching。

Result: LCF不仅提高了收敛速度，还稳定了表示质量，解决了低噪声病理问题。

Conclusion: 解决低噪声病理对于充分发挥Flow matching在生成和表示学习中的潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

TL;DR: MixGate框架通过功能对齐先训练共享表示空间，然后引入多视图掩码建模，解决了布尔电路多视图学习中结构异质性导致的融合困难问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 布尔电路的不同图表示（如AIG与XMG）具有互补的结构和语义信息，但视图间的巨大结构异质性阻碍了有效融合，特别是对于掩码建模等自监督技术，交叉视图上下文会被视为噪声。

Method: 提出MixGate框架，采用分阶段训练策略：首先通过等价对齐损失学习共享的功能感知表示空间，然后引入多视图掩码建模目标来利用对齐视图作为丰富的互补信号。

Result: 广泛的实验和消融研究表明，这种对齐优先策略将掩码建模从无效技术转变为强大的性能驱动因素。

Conclusion: 功能对齐是多视图自监督学习发挥效力的必要前提条件，MixGate框架成功解决了布尔电路多视图学习中的融合挑战。

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different
graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic
information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as
an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a
critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques
like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view
context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is
a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We
introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that
first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an
Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked
modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich,
complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation
study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling
from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

Motivation: 个性化医疗需要为患者找到最优治疗方案，但无法随意测试候选治疗，而现有的替代模型无法泛化到未见过的患者-治疗组合。

Method: 使用LLM作为随机引擎，通过'提示优化'方法，利用其理解非结构化领域知识的能力，在自然语言中提出个性化治疗计划。

Result: 在真实世界优化任务中，LEON在提出个体化治疗方案方面优于传统方法和基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: LEON证明了利用LLM结合领域先验知识进行个性化治疗优化的有效性，为个性化医疗提供了新的方法。

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for
proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show
LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

Motivation: 现有基于定位的方法无法区分负责遗忘不良知识和保留必要技能的神经元，将它们视为单一纠缠组，导致统一干预可能造成灾难性过度遗忘或目标知识不完全擦除。

Method: 使用电路发现机制解释技术，识别遗忘和保留电路，将电路转换为合取范式，根据可满足性解分配神经元角色，并为不同类别神经元提供有针对性的微调策略。

Result: 与现有定位方法相比，CLUE通过精确的神经定位实现了优越的遗忘效果和保留效用。

Conclusion: CLUE框架通过冲突引导的定位方法，有效解决了LLM遗忘中神经元纠缠问题，实现了更精确和有效的知识遗忘。

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

Motivation: 图级异常检测在药物发现等领域很重要，但高标注成本和数据集不平衡限制了图神经网络的性能。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集上的14种GNN实验显示，FracAug将平均AUROC、AUPRC和F1分数分别提升了5.72%、7.23%和4.18%。

Conclusion: FracAug作为一个模型无关的模块，具有显著的通用性和有效性，能够与各种GNN兼容并持续提升性能。

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12
real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and
F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU推理中缓存效率是主要瓶颈，推荐模型中的嵌入命中率和LLM中的KV缓存未命中严重影响性能。启发式策略如LRU在结构化访问模式下表现不佳，而现有学习型方法存在预测不准时性能急剧下降或设计保守收益有限的问题。

Method: 提出LCR框架，核心算法LARU通过机器学习预测增强LRU，并通过在线错误估计动态适应预测准确性。

Result: 在DLRM和LLM场景中，LCR将吞吐量提升高达24.2%，P99 TTFT降低高达28.3%，优于广泛使用的推理系统。即使在预测不佳时性能也保持稳定。

Conclusion: LCR在基于学习的缓存领域架起了实证进展与理论进步之间的桥梁，提供了性能增益同时确保鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In
recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while
in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase
time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%
and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference
systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,
demonstrating practical robustness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解缠大语言模型隐藏状态中的特征时，通常依赖带有隐式正则化的自编码器，但缺乏对实例间全局稀疏性的显式保证，导致产生大量密集特征，损害了特征的稀疏性和原子化。

Method: 提出二进制自编码器（BAE），通过在小批量隐藏激活上强制执行最小熵来促进特征独立性和稀疏性。使用阶跃函数将隐藏激活离散化为1位，并应用梯度估计实现反向传播。

Result: BAE在特征集熵计算和特征解缠两个主要应用中表现优异：能够可靠估计二进制隐藏激活的熵来表征LLM推理动态；在特征提取方面避免了密集特征，同时产生最多可解释特征。

Conclusion: BAE作为一种特征提取器是有效的，能够避免密集特征并产生大量可解释特征，改进了传统特征解缠方法的局限性。

explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

TL;DR: 提出Local-UID方案和ColorGNN模型，通过局部唯一标识符解决ILP优化中GNN表达力与泛化能力的权衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准匿名GNN在整数线性规划(ILP)优化中表达力有限，而全局唯一标识符(UID)通常引入虚假相关性，严重损害泛化能力

Method: 基于d跳唯一性着色的局部UID方案，确保标识符仅在节点的d跳邻域内唯一；提出ColorGNN（通过颜色条件嵌入整合颜色信息）和轻量级变体ColorUID

Result: 实验表明：(i)在三个ILP基准上取得显著提升；(ii)在线性规划数据集上展现强OOD泛化能力；(iii)与SOTA方法结合进一步提升图级任务性能

Conclusion: Local-UID方案在d层网络中实现与Global-UID相同的表达力，同时提供更强的泛化能力，有效解决了ILP优化中GNN表达力与泛化性的权衡问题

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but
notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a
promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard
backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for
ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique
identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely
harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious
Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers
are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme,
we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via
color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level
variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive
power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive
experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP
benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming
datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired
with a state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: 提出将无损压缩作为评估时间序列模型的新范式，通过香农信源编码定理建立压缩长度与负对数似然的等价关系，提供统一的信息论建模能力评估标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列模型评估主要关注预测、插补、异常检测和分类等任务，这些方法主要评估任务特定性能，无法严格衡量模型是否捕捉数据的完整生成分布。

Method: 基于香农信源编码定理，建立最优压缩长度与负对数似然的直接等价关系；定义标准化评估协议和指标；开发开源评估框架TSCom-Bench，支持时间序列模型作为无损压缩骨干的快速适配。

Result: 在多样化数据集上对TimeXer、iTransformer、PatchTST等最先进模型的实验表明，压缩能够揭示传统基准测试忽略的分布弱点。

Conclusion: 无损压缩作为一个原则性任务，能够补充和扩展现有的时间序列建模评估方法。

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

Motivation: 多智能体飞行轨迹预测对于理解空中交通流至关重要，但面临建模个体飞机行为和复杂交互关系的挑战，同时需要生成可解释的预测结果。

Method: 提出MAIFormer框架，包含两个关键注意力模块：掩码多元注意力（捕捉个体飞机的时空模式）和智能体注意力（建模复杂空中交通场景中多智能体的社交模式）。

Conclusion: MAIFormer不仅性能优越，还能从人类视角产生可解释的预测结果，提高了模型的透明度和空中交通控制中的实际效用。

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides
critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows.
However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging.
One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft
behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating
explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture
that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features
two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures
spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,
which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic
scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of
Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show
that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and
outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes
that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the
transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central
challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based
strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or
overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high
target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This
unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining
phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective
solution for de novo drug discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

TL;DR: rBridge是一种方法，通过使用小模型（≤1B参数）来预测大模型（7B+参数）的推理能力，通过在预训练目标和目标任务之间进行对齐，显著降低了数据集排名的成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于预训练大型语言模型的成本过高，需要利用小模型作为代理来优化数据集，但推理能力是涌现行为，通常只在超过7B参数的大模型中可靠出现。

Method: rBridge通过使用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为黄金标签，用任务对齐来加权负对数似然，使小模型更接近预训练目标和目标任务。

Result: rBridge将数据集排名成本降低了100倍以上，在1B到32B规模的六个推理基准上实现了最强的相关性，并在1B到7B规模的预训练数据集上实现了零样本迁移预测关系。

Conclusion: rBridge为以较低成本探索面向推理的预训练提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs是否能够真正学习和泛化新的推理策略（而不仅仅是预训练中编码的技能）这一开放性问题。

Method: 使用DELTA-Code基准测试，通过模板化问题生成器隔离推理技能，引入完全分布外的问题家族，探索强化学习训练中的关键要素如分阶段预热、经验回放、课程训练等。

Result: 实验发现明显的顿悟相变现象：在长时间接近零奖励后，RL训练模型突然达到接近完美的准确率；在家族内和重组技能方面有显著提升，但在转换性案例中仍存在持续弱点。

Conclusion: DELTA提供了一个清晰的测试平台，用于探索RL驱动推理的极限，并理解模型如何超越现有先验来获取新的算法技能。

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统actor-critic方法依赖分离的actor和critic网络，训练复杂且对架构决策和超参数调优敏感，限制了在大规模函数逼近器中的可扩展性。扩散模型虽然能表达多模态行为，但引入了额外设计选择和计算负担。

Method: 提出ACA框架，消除显式actor网络，通过噪声级critic的梯度场直接生成动作，保持策略改进与critic最新价值估计的紧密对齐。

Result: 在标准在线RL基准测试中，ACA相比标准actor-critic方法和最先进的基于扩散的方法，实现了更有利的学习曲线和竞争性性能。

Conclusion: ACA为在线强化学习提供了一个简单而强大的解决方案，结合了简洁性和表达能力。

Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning
(RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective
across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks,
which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter
tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large
function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed
as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve
exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational
burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without
Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network
and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level
critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor
training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's
latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse,
multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining
simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard
online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and
competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful
solution for online RL.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型集成新模态增强了能力，但也引入了额外漏洞。现有视觉越狱攻击虽然简单有效，但跨模型迁移性极差，无法可靠识别闭源模型的漏洞。

Method: 分析了越狱攻击的损失景观，发现攻击位于高锐度区域；提出FORCE方法，引导攻击探索更广泛的可行区域，重新调整频率特征的影响，消除对层和频谱特征的非泛化依赖。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效促进了针对闭源多模态大语言模型的视觉红队评估，提高了攻击的跨模型迁移性。

Conclusion: 通过消除对特定层和频谱特征的过度依赖，FORCE方法发现了视觉越狱攻击的平坦可行区域，显著提升了攻击的跨模型迁移能力。

Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities.
In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source
MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these
underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability,
failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this
work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that
the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose
effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during
transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their
feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral
domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and
semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature
Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore
broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of
frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating
non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method
discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby
improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against
closed-source MLLMs.

Conclusion: RL微调系统性地改变LLMs内部电路，在线RL与基于偏好的方法存在方法论差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the
Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key
challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion
process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse
diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive
multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a
Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on
multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian
surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines
in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

Result: 理论证明SATMC能实现比现有图域自适应方法更紧的跨网络节点分类误差界。在9对公开跨域数据集上的实验表明，SATMC在跨网络节点分类任务中优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: SATMC通过结构-属性转换和私有信息减少机制，有效解决了图域自适应中的结构异质性问题，显著提升了跨网络节点分类性能。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce
scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph
domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw
graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node
features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the
underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads
to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework
that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure
and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of
domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization,
SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an
empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can
achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to
existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs
of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The
code is available at https://github.com/GiantZhangYT/SATMC.

TL;DR: ScaleDiff是一个高效创建困难数学问题的流水线，通过自适应思维模型识别现有数据集中的困难问题，然后训练专门的困难问题生成器，避免了复杂提示和高昂的API成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩展困难数学问题生成方面面临高计算成本、复杂提示和生成问题难度有限等挑战，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用自适应思维模型单次前向传播识别困难问题，然后训练专门的DiffGen-8B生成器大规模生成新困难问题，无需复杂提示。

Result: 在ScaleDiff-Math数据集上微调Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct，性能提升11.3%，在多个数学竞赛基准上达到65.9%的平均准确率，超越OpenThinker3等强模型。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff证明了通过高效识别和生成困难问题可以显著提升推理模型性能，且无需依赖昂贵的大模型作为教师模型，展现了明显的扩展现象。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TyphoonMLA是一种混合方法，结合了naive和absorb两种注意力计算方式，在MLA架构中提升注意力计算吞吐量，在NPU和GPU上分别达到3倍和3.24倍的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLA解码内核使用absorb方法最小化HBM带宽使用，但其计算密集型特性无法利用注意力计算中的数据重用机会（如共享前缀）。

Method: 提出TyphoonMLA混合方法，对注意力计算的计算密集型部分使用naive公式，对非共享部分使用absorb公式来减少带宽需求。

Result: 在NPU和GPU上注意力计算吞吐量分别提升3倍和3.24倍，HBM大小仅增加3%的开销。

Conclusion: TyphoonMLA通过混合方法有效利用了两种公式的优势，显著提升了MLA架构的性能。

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphUniverse是一个用于生成图家族的系统框架，首次实现了大规模归纳泛化的系统评估，揭示了传导性能与归纳泛化之间的弱相关性，并为开发鲁棒图架构提供了基准测试平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图学习中模型如何泛化到新图的核心挑战，现有方法局限于单图传导设置，缺乏对归纳泛化的系统评估。

Method: 引入GraphUniverse框架，生成具有持久语义社区的图家族，通过控制同配性和度分布等结构特性，实现概念一致性和细粒度结构控制。

Result: 基准测试显示传导性能是归纳泛化的弱预测指标；对分布偏移的鲁棒性高度依赖于模型架构选择和初始图机制；为开发鲁棒架构提供了灵活可扩展的平台。

Conclusion: GraphUniverse填补了图学习归纳泛化评估的空白，为开发真正可泛化的图架构（包括下一代图基础模型）提供了重要工具和见解。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled
settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph,
transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at
https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app.

TL;DR: VARL是一个利用视觉语言模型作为动作建议器来提升在线强化学习样本效率的框架，通过提供动作建议而非设计启发式奖励来保证最优性和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线强化学习在复杂任务中需要大量交互步骤，而视觉语言动作策略在低层控制方面表现有限，且通常需要任务特定的专家演示进行微调。

Method: 提出VARL框架，利用视觉语言模型的领域知识为强化学习智能体提供动作建议，增加样本多样性，提升样本效率。

Result: 在多种环境和智能体设置下的评估表明，VARL显著提高了样本效率，且没有引入显著的计算开销。

Conclusion: VARL是一个通用的在线强化学习框架，使得在真实世界环境中从零开始直接应用强化学习变得可行。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoMail是一个自我演进的认知代理框架，通过构建统一的异构邮件图，结合认知图神经网络和LLM进行上下文感知推理，并通过红蓝对抗团队实现持续进化，显著提升了垃圾邮件和钓鱼攻击的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代垃圾邮件和钓鱼攻击已超越传统关键词黑名单或简单启发式方法，采用多模态策略结合自然语言文本、混淆URL、伪造头部和恶意附件，传统检测系统难以整合异构信号和持续适应，导致性能快速下降。

Method: 构建统一异构邮件图融合文本内容、元数据和嵌入资源；使用认知图神经网络结合LLM进行上下文感知推理；建立红蓝对抗自进化循环，红队生成新规避策略，蓝队从失败中学习并压缩经验到记忆模块。

Result: 在真实数据集（Enron-Spam、Ling-Spam、SpamAssassin、TREC）和合成对抗变体上的广泛实验表明，EvoMail在检测准确率、对演进垃圾邮件策略的适应性和推理可解释性方面持续优于最先进基线。

Conclusion: EvoMail作为针对下一代垃圾邮件和钓鱼威胁的弹性和可解释防御框架具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword
blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns
that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and
malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.
Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or
single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to
continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust
detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified
heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,
senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive
Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs
context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam
campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution
loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character
obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector
learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses
them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,
SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that
EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection
accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of
reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient
and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing
threats.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用稀疏主成分分析(SPCA)作为对抗性攻击的防御方法，通过理论分析和实验验证表明，稀疏投影能够降低对抗性扰动的影响，同时保持较好的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类任务中表现优异，但对精心设计的对抗性扰动仍然脆弱。本研究重新审视线性降维作为一种简单、数据自适应的防御方法。

Method: 使用标准主成分分析(PCA)及其稀疏变体(SPCA)作为前端特征提取器，结合下游分类器进行实验，并进行理论分析。理论方面推导了SPCA特征的精确鲁棒性证书，并证明稀疏性通过Lipschitz组合参数降低算子范数边界。

Result: 实验表明，在强白盒和黑盒攻击下，SPCA比PCA表现更稳健，同时保持竞争力的干净准确率。理论分析识别了稀疏投影减少对抗性影响的机制。

Conclusion: 稀疏投影能够有效降低对抗性攻击的影响，这一优势在线性和非线性设置中都得到验证，为对抗性防御提供了一种简单有效的方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了LAVA方法，一种模型无关的后处理技术，用于解释无监督黑盒模型的潜在嵌入空间结构，通过分析局部邻域中的特征关联模式来揭示输入特征与潜在空间组织之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督黑盒模型虽然能驱动科学发现，但难以解释。现有解释方法要么过于细粒度（单样本级），要么过于简化（数据集级），缺乏基于潜在空间邻近性的自动化策略来关联相似样本。

Method: LAVA将潜在空间表示为一系列局部邻域，通过原始特征之间的相关性来描述这些邻域，然后揭示整个潜在空间中重复出现的相关性模式。

Result: 在MNIST和单细胞肾脏数据集的UMAP嵌入上，LAVA能够捕获相关的特征关联，在看似遥远的潜在空间区域之间发现视觉和生物学相关的局部模式。

Conclusion: LAVA方法能够有效解释无监督学习模型的局部嵌入组织，揭示输入特征与潜在空间结构之间的有意义关系。

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

TL;DR: 提出了CAD-Tokenizer框架，通过模态特定令牌和多模态分词策略解决CAD序列表示问题，显著提升了文本引导CAD原型设计的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM分词器将CAD序列分解为自然语言词片段，无法捕捉CAD的原始语义和几何结构，阻碍了文本引导CAD原型设计的发展。

Method: 使用基于序列的VQ-VAE，结合原始级池化和约束解码，生成紧凑、原始感知的CAD数据表示。

Result: CAD-Tokenizer在统一文本引导CAD原型设计中显著改善了指令遵循和生成质量，在定量和定性评估中优于通用LLM和任务特定基线。

Conclusion: 多模态分词策略能够提供更有效的CAD表示，为文本引导CAD原型设计提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

Motivation: 质疑使用显式定义的高成本PRM的优势，探索利用GRPO算法中隐藏的PRM结构来提升模型性能。

Method: 理论证明GRPO诱导PRM的条件，提出λ-GRPO改进算法，通过实验验证假设和算法效果。

Result: λ-GRPO训练的LLM在验证准确率和下游推理任务上表现更好，达到峰值性能更快，且训练时间和成本几乎没有增加。

Conclusion: 可以利用GRPO算法内置的隐藏PRM结构来提升性能，无需依赖高成本的显式PRM定义。

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

TL;DR: 提出DATS方法，通过原型距离估计和距离感知校准，在持续学习中实现无需任务信息的自适应温度缩放，显著降低跨任务校准误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法主要从数据角度处理校准问题，使用单一温度参数，忽略了任务特异性差异，导致不同任务间校准误差波动较大。在安全关键应用中，模型不仅需要预测性能，还需要可靠的校准不确定性。

Method: 提出距离感知温度缩放(DATS)，结合原型距离估计和距离感知校准，无需先验任务信息即可推断任务邻近度并分配自适应温度参数。

Result: 在标准基准和真实世界生物医学不平衡数据集上的广泛实验表明，相比最先进方法，DATS在减少跨任务校准误差方面表现稳定、可靠且一致。

Conclusion: DATS方法通过距离感知的温度缩放策略，有效解决了持续学习中任务特异性校准问题，为安全关键应用提供了更可靠的校准不确定性估计。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its
ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new
classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive
performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive
performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to
reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with
confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing
approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,
relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions
overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in
calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more
principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to
the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test
time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended
objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),
which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware
calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without
prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard
benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical
domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in
reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

TL;DR: MoT是一种在异构专家模型之间进行潜在层协作的方法，通过轻量级路由器选择专家，在共享潜在空间中进行交叉注意力，实现单次推理的多模型协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型日益专业化，需要利用不同模型的互补优势。现有方法要么路由到少数专家独立生成，要么通过多轮交换聚合输出，要么融合权重但需要架构同质性。

Method: 使用轻量级路由器选择top-K专家并指定主专家，通过交互层将隐藏状态投影到共享潜在空间，主专家对活跃同伴进行交叉注意力。预训练专家保持冻结，只训练路由器和交互层。

Result: 在5个分布内和3个分布外基准测试中，MoT超越了当前最先进的路由和聚合方法Avengers，分别提升+0.38%和+2.92%，显著优于最佳单模型，且推理时间与路由基线相当。

Conclusion: MoT提供了一种简单的潜在空间机制来组合异构LLM，是实现更广泛多LLM协作的实用步骤。

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain
(e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage
complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i)
route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii)
aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii)
fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity.
We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level
collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For
each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a
primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into
a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over
its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router
and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training
objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert
collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based
state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further,
MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves
this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and
none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple
latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step
toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型遗忘方法通常依赖于最小化目标概念与锚概念输出分布之间的均方误差，但这种方法存在局限性。

Result: 展示了f-散度框架的优越性，能够根据具体应用需求选择合适散度，在激进遗忘和概念保留之间实现更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架为扩散模型机器遗忘提供了更灵活有效的方法，超越了传统MSE方法的限制。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Method: 采用相对上下文差异(RCD)预训练范式，训练模型检测相邻时间窗口的显著差异而非重构输入；使用标准Transformer架构；构建大规模多样化合成语料库进行预训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，TimeRCD在零样本时间序列异常检测中显著优于现有的通用和异常专用基础模型。

Conclusion: RCD范式验证了其优越性，为构建鲁棒且可泛化的时间序列异常检测基础模型提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...

Conclusion: GWTF成功实现了大语言模型在异构客户端环境下的高效去中心化协作训练，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance
of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant
practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing
distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient
collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their
resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or
leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in
realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes
distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

Conclusion: Tree-GRPO通过树搜索采样和过程监督信号有效解决了稀疏监督问题，理论分析表明组内相对策略优化等价于步骤级直接偏好学习。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

Motivation: 理解低秩适应(LoRA)微调机制如何改变大语言模型的结构推理和语义行为仍然是一个开放挑战，需要开发新的解释方法来揭示微调模型的内部机制。

Method: 构建领域特定的异质知识图谱BioToolKG，设计基于反事实的微调LLM解释器(CFFTLLMExplainer)，学习图谱节点和边的软掩码来生成最小结构扰动，同时优化结构稀疏性和语义分歧，并施加可解释性保持约束如熵正则化和边平滑性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解微调LLM的内部机制提供了新见解，并强调反事实图谱作为可解释AI的潜在工具。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

Motivation: 数据分散在设备和机构中，隐私、所有权和法规限制阻止了数据集中化，需要在不进行中心聚合的情况下直接从分布式数据训练生成模型。

Method: FFM-vanilla：客户端使用独立源和目标耦合进行本地训练；FFM-LOT：使用本地最优传输耦合改善流直线性；FFM-GOT：基于最优传输半对偶公式，通过共享全局势函数协调客户端间耦合。

Result: 在合成和图像数据集上的实验表明，FFM能够在联邦设置中实现隐私保护训练，同时提升流直线性和样本质量，性能与集中式基线相当。

Conclusion: FFM框架成功解决了在隐私约束下训练生成模型的挑战，通过不同的联邦策略在保护隐私的同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and
institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization.
This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed
data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated
Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under
privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each
client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving
privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,
which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within
each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we
propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of
optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates
couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that
FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow
straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance
comparable to the centralized baseline.

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based
environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了概率平滑策略优化(PSPO)方法，通过平滑当前策略概率来替代强化学习中常用的比率裁剪，在保持梯度信号的同时创建软信任区域，显著提升语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法如PPO和GRPO依赖比率裁剪来稳定更新，但裁剪会丢弃信息并引入梯度不连续性。需要一种既能防止不稳定更新又能保留梯度信息的方法。

Method: 提出PSPO方法，在计算重要性比率前将当前策略的概率向旧策略平滑，类似于标签平滑。在GRPO框架中实例化为GR-PSPO，用于微调语言模型。

Result: 在GSM8K测试集上，GR-PSPO相比裁剪GRPO显著提升性能：0.5B模型从17.6%提升到39.7%，1.5B模型从37.8%提升到59.4%。同时生成更清晰、简洁和逻辑性更强的推理过程。

Conclusion: PSPO通过概率平滑有效替代比率裁剪，在保持稳定性的同时显著提升语言模型的推理能力和泛化性能，为强化学习训练提供了更好的优化方法。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的算法，用于在Lp范数约束下计算广义线性模型的最优鲁棒追索，相比现有方法显著降低了追索成本并提高了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒追索方法使用L∞范数会导致追索成本过高，且大多数方法缺乏理论最优性保证，需要一种在更现实的Lp范数约束下能提供最优追索的算法。

Method: 开发了一种新算法，在Lp范数（p≥1但p≠∞）约束下，为广义线性模型计算可证明最优的鲁棒追索。

Result: 实证表明，该算法相比现有方法显著降低了追索成本（可达几个数量级），在追索实施成本与有效性之间实现了更好的权衡，且提供更稀疏的追索方案。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法在Lp范数约束下能够计算最优鲁棒追索，显著优于现有方法，且对保证可行性的后处理方法具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a
loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement
suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often
get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,
invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will
not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses
this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is
resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization
problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),
most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the
optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first
provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized
linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm.
However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high
price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes
defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a
new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for
generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,
we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of
recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also
exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its
validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides
more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to
post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

VCN${}_{k,k}$-dimension (essentially $k$-dependence from Shelah's
classification theory). This model suggests a theoretical explanation for the
success of certain algorithms in the 2006~Netflix Prize competition.

### [124] [Fast Estimation of Wasserstein Distances via Regression on Sliced Wasserstein Distances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20508)
*Khai Nguyen,Hai Nguyen,Nhat Ho*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出一种基于切片Wasserstein距离回归的快速Wasserstein距离估计方法，通过线性组合SW距离来高效预测Wasserstein距离，在多个任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从元分布中抽取的多对分布之间Wasserstein距离的高效计算问题，传统方法计算成本高，需要快速估计方法。

Method: 使用标准SW距离（提供下界）和提升SW距离（提供上界）作为预测变量，构建两种线性模型：无约束模型和有约束模型（参数减半），通过少量分布对学习准确模型。

Result: 在多个数据集（MNIST点云、ShapeNetV2、MERFISH Cell Niches、scRNA-seq）上验证，方法在低数据情况下比最先进的Wasserstein嵌入模型Wasserstein Wormhole提供更好的近似，并能加速Wormhole训练。

Conclusion: 提出的回归方法能够高效准确地估计Wasserstein距离，在多个实际应用中表现优异，特别是在数据稀缺情况下优于现有方法。

Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently computing Wasserstein distances for
multiple pairs of distributions drawn from a meta-distribution. To this end, we
propose a fast estimation method based on regressing Wasserstein distance on
sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances. Specifically, we leverage both standard SW
distances, which provide lower bounds, and lifted SW distances, which provide
upper bounds, as predictors of the true Wasserstein distance. To ensure
parsimony, we introduce two linear models: an unconstrained model with a
closed-form least-squares solution, and a constrained model that uses only half
as many parameters. We show that accurate models can be learned from a small
number of distribution pairs. Once estimated, the model can predict the
Wasserstein distance for any pair of distributions via a linear combination of
SW distances, making it highly efficient. Empirically, we validate our approach
on diverse tasks, including Gaussian mixtures, point-cloud classification, and
Wasserstein-space visualizations for 3D point clouds. Across various datasets
such as MNIST point clouds, ShapeNetV2, MERFISH Cell Niches, and scRNA-seq, our
method consistently provides a better approximation of Wasserstein distance
than the state-of-the-art Wasserstein embedding model, Wasserstein Wormhole,
particularly in low-data regimes. Finally, we demonstrate that our estimator
can also accelerate Wormhole training, yielding \textit{RG-Wormhole}.

*Chao Ying,Jun Jin,Haotian Zhang,Qinglong Tian,Yanyuan Ma,Yixuan Li,Jiwei Zhao*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文研究了一个具有未观测子群体的无监督域适应问题，通过分布匹配方法估计子群体比例，在目标域中恢复了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在源域中存在由二元标签Y和背景变量A定义的子群体，其中一个子群体不可观测。忽略这个未观测群体会导致估计偏差和预测性能下降，因此需要解决这种结构化缺失问题。

Method: 提出分布匹配方法来估计子群体比例，严格推导了目标域中背景特定和整体预测模型，并提供了理论保证。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于不考虑未观测源子群体的朴素基准方法。

Conclusion: 即使在源域存在未观测子群体的挑战性设置下，仍然可以恢复目标域的预测性能，提出的方法具有理论保证和实际有效性。

Abstract: We study an unsupervised domain adaptation problem where the source domain
consists of subpopulations defined by the binary label $Y$ and a binary
background (or environment) $A$. We focus on a challenging setting in which one
such subpopulation in the source domain is unobservable. Naively ignoring this
unobserved group can result in biased estimates and degraded predictive
performance. Despite this structured missingness, we show that the prediction
in the target domain can still be recovered. Specifically, we rigorously derive
both background-specific and overall prediction models for the target domain.
For practical implementation, we propose the distribution matching method to
estimate the subpopulation proportions. We provide theoretical guarantees for
the asymptotic behavior of our estimator, and establish an upper bound on the
prediction error. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show
that our method outperforms the naive benchmark that does not account for this
unobservable source subpopulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究函数类的间隙尺度敏感维度，旨在推广现有关于覆盖数控制的结果，并为统计和在线学习中的收敛率下界提供更强的证明方法。

Method: 通过分析序贯和非序贯设置下的间隙尺度敏感维度，证明其对覆盖数的控制，并将这些维度与偏移Rademacher平均值的下界联系起来。

Result: 证明了任何一致有界函数类的覆盖数都由间隙尺度敏感维度控制，并且这些维度能够导出偏移Rademacher平均值的下界。

Conclusion: 间隙尺度敏感维度不仅推广了现有覆盖数控制的结果，还加强了统计和在线学习中收敛率下界的证明方法。

Abstract: We study gapped scale-sensitive dimensions of a function class in both
sequential and non-sequential settings. We demonstrate that covering numbers
for any uniformly bounded class are controlled above by these gapped
dimensions, generalizing the results of
\cite{anthony2000function,alon1997scale}. Moreover, we show that the gapped
dimensions lead to lower bounds on offset Rademacher averages, thereby
strengthening existing approaches for proving lower bounds on rates of
convergence in statistical and online learning.

Conclusion: 提出的贝叶斯框架能有效解决生物成像空间数据分析中的信号混淆问题，在恢复组织结构和检测活跃区域方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: The analysis of spatial data from biological imaging technology, such as
imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) or imaging mass cytometry (IMC), is challenging
because of a competitive sampling process which convolves signals from
molecules in a single pixel. To address this, we develop a scalable Bayesian
framework that leverages natural sparsity in spatial signal patterns to recover
relative rates for each molecule across the entire image. Our method relies on
the use of a heavy-tailed variant of the graphical lasso prior and a novel
hierarchical variational family, enabling efficient inference via automatic
differentiation variational inference. Simulation results show that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-practice point estimate methodologies in IMS,
and has superior posterior coverage than mean-field variational inference
techniques. Results on real IMS data demonstrate that our approach better
recovers the true anatomical structure of known tissue, removes artifacts, and
detects active regions missed by the standard analysis approach.

Conclusion: RAPTOR-GEN开发了一个快速稳健的算法，具有可控误差，能够有效加速生物制造过程的数字孪生开发。

Abstract: Biopharmaceutical manufacturing is vital to public health but lacks the
agility for rapid, on-demand production of biotherapeutics due to the
complexity and variability of bioprocesses. To overcome this, we introduce
RApid PosTeriOR GENerator (RAPTOR-GEN), a mechanism-informed Bayesian learning
framework designed to accelerate intelligent digital twin development from
sparse and heterogeneous experimental data. This framework is built on a
multi-scale probabilistic knowledge graph (pKG), formulated as a stochastic
differential equation (SDE)-based foundational model that captures the
nonlinear dynamics of bioprocesses. RAPTOR-GEN consists of two ingredients: (i)
an interpretable metamodel integrating linear noise approximation (LNA) that
exploits the structural information of bioprocessing mechanisms and a
sequential learning strategy to fuse heterogeneous and sparse data, enabling
inference of latent state variables and explicit approximation of the
intractable likelihood function; and (ii) an efficient Bayesian posterior
sampling method that utilizes Langevin diffusion (LD) to accelerate posterior
exploration by exploiting the gradients of the derived likelihood. It
generalizes the LNA approach to circumvent the challenge of step size
selection, facilitating robust learning of mechanistic parameters with provable
finite-sample performance guarantees. We develop a fast and robust RAPTOR-GEN
algorithm with controllable error. Numerical experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in uncovering the underlying regulatory mechanisms of
biomanufacturing processes.

TL;DR: 提出了条件白化生成模型(CW-Gen)框架，通过条件白化将先验信息整合到生成模型中，改进了多变量时间序列的概率预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列的概率预测面临非平稳性、变量间依赖和分布偏移的挑战，现有扩散和流匹配模型往往忽略条件均值和协方差等有用先验信息。

Method: 提出条件白化生成模型框架，设计了联合均值-协方差估计器(JMCE)同时学习条件均值和滑动窗口协方差，并基于此构建了条件白化扩散模型(CW-Diff)和条件白化流匹配(CW-Flow)。

Result: 在五个真实世界数据集和六个最先进生成模型上的实验表明，CW-Gen一致提升了预测性能，比无先验方法更能有效捕捉非平稳动态和变量间相关性，并能有效缓解分布偏移的影响。

Conclusion: 条件白化生成模型通过整合先验信息显著改善了多变量时间序列的概率预测性能，特别是在处理非平稳性和分布偏移方面表现出色。

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series is challenging due to
non-stationarity, inter-variable dependencies, and distribution shifts. While
recent diffusion and flow matching models have shown promise, they often ignore
informative priors such as conditional means and covariances. In this work, we
propose Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen), a framework that
incorporates prior information through conditional whitening. Theoretically, we
establish sufficient conditions under which replacing the traditional terminal
distribution of diffusion models, namely the standard multivariate normal, with
a multivariate normal distribution parameterized by estimators of the
conditional mean and covariance improves sample quality. Guided by this
analysis, we design a novel Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE) that
simultaneously learns the conditional mean and sliding-window covariance.
Building on JMCE, we introduce Conditionally Whitened Diffusion Models
(CW-Diff) and extend them to Conditionally Whitened Flow Matching (CW-Flow).
Experiments on five real-world datasets with six state-of-the-art generative
models demonstrate that CW-Gen consistently enhances predictive performance,
capturing non-stationary dynamics and inter-variable correlations more
effectively than prior-free approaches. Empirical results further demonstrate
that CW-Gen can effectively mitigate the effects of distribution shift.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了第一个完全经验性的PAC-Bayes边界，用于马尔可夫链，通过经验估计伪谱间隙来避免依赖未知的混合系数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PAC和PAC-Bayes边界对具有时间依赖性的数据可用，但这些边界依赖于数据生成过程的未知属性（如混合系数、混合时间、谱间隙等），在实践中无法获知。

Method: 证明了一个新的PAC-Bayes边界，依赖于伪谱间隙，并提供了在状态空间有限时伪谱间隙的经验边界估计方法。

Result: 在模拟实验中，经验版本的边界与非经验版本基本一样紧致。

Conclusion: 这是第一个完全经验性的PAC-Bayes边界，适用于马尔可夫链，且可扩展到有限状态空间之外的情况（需要额外假设）。

Abstract: The core of generalization theory was developed for independent observations.
Some PAC and PAC-Bayes bounds are available for data that exhibit a temporal
dependence. However, there are constants in these bounds that depend on
properties of the data-generating process: mixing coefficients, mixing time,
spectral gap... Such constants are unknown in practice. In this paper, we prove
a new PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains. This bound depends on a quantity
called the pseudo-spectral gap. The main novelty is that we can provide an
empirical bound on the pseudo-spectral gap when the state space is finite.
Thus, we obtain the first fully empirical PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains.
This extends beyond the finite case, although this requires additional
assumptions. On simulated experiments, the empirical version of the bound is
essentially as tight as the non-empirical one.

Motivation: 解决传统Best-of-N方法在无限测试预算下性能优异但计算成本高的问题，寻求在有限推理预算下实现类似性能的方法。

Method: 提出基于答案一致性的自适应生成方案，动态选择N值；扩展为多LLM加权集成框架，通过混合整数线性规划计算最优权重。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，加权集成能够超越任何单个模型性能。

Conclusion: 自适应生成和加权集成框架能够在有限推理预算下实现接近Best-of-∞的性能，多模型集成优于单一模型。

Abstract: We study best-of-$N$ for large language models (LLMs) where the selection is
based on majority voting. In particular, we analyze the limit $N \to \infty$,
which we denote as Best-of-$\infty$. While this approach achieves impressive
performance in the limit, it requires an infinite test-time budget. To address
this, we propose an adaptive generation scheme that selects $N$ based on answer
agreement, thereby efficiently allocating inference-time computation. Beyond
adaptivity, we extend the framework to weighted ensembles of multiple LLMs,
showing that such mixtures can outperform any individual model. The optimal
ensemble weighting is formulated and efficiently computed as a mixed-integer
linear program. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach.

Conclusion: WISER是水印定位的有效工具，展示了经典统计问题视角如何为现代问题提供理论有效且计算高效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models, concerns over
content authenticity have led to the development of myriad watermarking
schemes. These schemes can be used to detect a machine-generated text via an
appropriate key, while being imperceptible to readers with no such keys. The
corresponding detection mechanisms usually take the form of statistical
hypothesis testing for the existence of watermarks, spurring extensive research
in this direction. However, the finer-grained problem of identifying which
segments of a mixed-source text are actually watermarked, is much less
explored; the existing approaches either lack scalability or theoretical
guarantees robust to paraphrase and post-editing. In this work, we introduce a
unique perspective to such watermark segmentation problems through the lens of
epidemic change-points. By highlighting the similarities as well as differences
of these two problems, we motivate and propose WISER: a novel, computationally
efficient, watermark segmentation algorithm. We theoretically validate our
algorithm by deriving finite sample error-bounds, and establishing its
consistency in detecting multiple watermarked segments in a single text.
Complementing these theoretical results, our extensive numerical experiments
show that WISER outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods, both in terms of
computational speed as well as accuracy, on various benchmark datasets embedded
with diverse watermarking schemes. Our theoretical and empirical findings
establish WISER as an effective tool for watermark localization in most
settings. It also shows how insights from a classical statistical problem can
lead to a theoretically valid and computationally efficient solution of a
modern and pertinent problem.

Motivation: 探讨在高维设置下，需要什么样的最小结构假设来防止统计学习边界随维度增加而退化，这对于理解维度诅咒的缓解机制至关重要。

Method: 在经典统计信号估计框架下，分析线性预测规则（包括岭回归、梯度下降和核方法等）的泛化误差，假设贝叶斯预测器位于椭球体中，并推导非渐近上下界。

Result: 识别了风险的两个基本贡献项：捕获数据内在维度的方差项和在高维机制中特有的无噪声误差项，为理解结构假设在缓解维度诅咒中的作用提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 结构假设在缓解高维统计学习中的维度诅咒方面发挥关键作用，特别是通过控制内在维度和处理高维机制特有的无噪声误差来实现泛化性能的稳定。

Abstract: In this work, we address the following question: What minimal structural
assumptions are needed to prevent the degradation of statistical learning
bounds with increasing dimensionality? We investigate this question in the
classical statistical setting of signal estimation from $n$ independent linear
observations $Y_i = X_i^{\top}\theta + \epsilon_i$. Our focus is on the
generalization properties of a broad family of predictors that can be expressed
as linear combinations of the training labels, $f(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} l_{i}(X)
Y_i$. This class -- commonly referred to as linear prediction rules --
encompasses a wide range of popular parametric and non-parametric estimators,
including ridge regression, gradient descent, and kernel methods. Our
contributions are twofold. First, we derive non-asymptotic upper and lower
bounds on the generalization error for this class under the assumption that the
Bayes predictor $\theta$ lies in an ellipsoid. Second, we establish a lower
bound for the subclass of rotationally invariant linear prediction rules when
the Bayes predictor is fixed. Our analysis highlights two fundamental
contributions to the risk: (a) a variance-like term that captures the intrinsic
dimensionality of the data; (b) the noiseless error, a term that arises
specifically in the high-dimensional regime. These findings shed light on the
role of structural assumptions in mitigating the curse of dimensionality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回应Ober等人(2021)关于深度核学习中高斯过程边际似然分析的观点，澄清重新参数化对超参数选择的影响。

Method: 通过数学分析展示重新参数化后边际似然的实际组成，证明数据拟合项仍然存在并影响所有核超参数。

Result: 重新参数化并没有消除数据拟合项的影响，而是引入了另一个数据拟合项，数据拟合和复杂度惩罚之间的平衡仍然在确定核超参数中起重要作用。

Conclusion: Ober等人的结论存在误解，深度核学习中的超参数选择仍然受到数据拟合和复杂度惩罚平衡的影响，而非仅由复杂度惩罚主导。

Abstract: This note responds to "Promises and Pitfalls of Deep Kernel Learning" (Ober
et al., 2021). The marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process can be
compartmentalized into a data fit term and a complexity penalty. Ober et al.
(2021) shows that if a kernel can be multiplied by a signal variance
coefficient, then reparametrizing and substituting in the maximized value of
this parameter sets a reparametrized data fit term to a fixed value. They use
this finding to argue that the complexity penalty, a log determinant of the
kernel matrix, then dominates in determining the other values of kernel
hyperparameters, which can lead to data overcorrelation. By contrast, we show
that the reparametrization in fact introduces another data-fit term which
influences all other kernel hyperparameters. Thus, a balance between data fit
and complexity still plays a significant role in determining kernel
hyperparameters.
