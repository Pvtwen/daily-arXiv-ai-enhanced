We present Fortytwo, a\nnovel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed\npairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our\napproach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a\npeer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that\nsurfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom\nBradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference\nsubstantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond\nversus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of\n+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol\nincorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated\naccuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality\nor malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs\nproof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete\ncalibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making\nmulti-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.\nAcross six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and\nAIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to\nadversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation\nof only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while\nretaining practical deployability.

The\nthesis is divided into two main sections, methodological and experimental work.\nA central concern in both sections is the large variability present in\nelectrophysiological recordings, whether it be within-subject or\nbetween-subject variability, and to a certain extent between-dataset\nvariability. In the methodological sections, we explore the potential of deep\nlearning for brain decoding. We present advancements in decoding visual stimuli\nusing linear models at the individual subject level. We then explore how deep\nlearning techniques can be employed for group decoding, introducing new methods\nto deal with between-subject variability. Finally, we also explores novel\nforecasting models of MEG data based on convolutional and Transformer-based\narchitectures. In particular, Transformer-based models demonstrate superior\ncapabilities in generating signals that closely match real brain data, thereby\nenhancing the accuracy and reliability of modelling the brain's\nelectrophysiology.

Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT\nScalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures\ncollected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant\nepilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised\nmachine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic\nRegression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.

Despite its theoretical\nappeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of\nautonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal\noption termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that\nintegrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)\nmodule into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of\nstate trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained\nusing heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent\nshifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred\nchange-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory\nsignals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain\nintra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce\nfunctional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over\nCPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the\nstandard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our\nframework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments\nare mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to\nautonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful\nskills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that\nCPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,\nand significantly improved option specialization.

While prior gait\nanalysis systems based on cameras, insoles, or body-mounted sensors have\ndemonstrated effectiveness, they are often bulky and limited to offline,\npost-run analysis. Wrist-worn wearables offer a more practical and\nnon-intrusive alternative, yet enabling real-time gait recognition on such\ndevices remains challenging due to noisy Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)\nsignals, limited computing resources, and dependence on cloud connectivity.\nThis paper introduces StrikeWatch, a compact wrist-worn system that performs\nentirely on-device, real-time gait recognition using IMU signals. As a case\nstudy, we target the detection of heel versus forefoot strikes to enable\nrunners to self-correct harmful gait patterns through visual and auditory\nfeedback during running. We propose four compact DL architectures (1D-CNN,\n1D-SepCNN, LSTM, and Transformer) and optimize them for energy-efficient\ninference on two representative embedded Field-Programmable Gate Arrays\n(FPGAs): the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 and the Lattice iCE40UP5K. Using our\ncustom-built hardware prototype, we collect a labeled dataset from outdoor\nrunning sessions and evaluate all models via a fully automated deployment\npipeline.

Nevertheless, the\nblack-box nature of tree ensembles is a strong limitation, especially for\napplications with critical decisions at stake. The Hoeffding or ANOVA\nfunctional decomposition is a powerful explainability method, as it breaks down\nblack-box models into a unique sum of lower-dimensional functions, provided\nthat input variables are independent. In standard learning settings, input\nvariables are often dependent, and the Hoeffding decomposition is generalized\nthrough hierarchical orthogonality constraints. Such generalization leads to\nunique and sparse decompositions with well-defined main effects and\ninteractions. However, the practical estimation of this decomposition from a\ndata sample is still an open problem. Therefore, we introduce the TreeHFD\nalgorithm to estimate the Hoeffding decomposition of a tree ensemble from a\ndata sample. We show the convergence of TreeHFD, along with the main properties\nof orthogonality, sparsity, and causal variable selection. The high performance\nof TreeHFD is demonstrated through experiments on both simulated and real data,\nusing our treehfd Python package (https://github.com/ThalesGroup/treehfd).\nBesides, we empirically show that the widely used TreeSHAP method, based on\nShapley values, is strongly connected to the Hoeffding decomposition."}

We demonstrate convergence under this mild reversibility condition on\nthe structure of the chain, which in many applications can be assumed using\ndomain knowledge. In particular, we establish a convergence guarantee under an\nupper bound on the discount factor in terms of the difference between the\non-policy and off-policy process.
