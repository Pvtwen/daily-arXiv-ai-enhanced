However, the interpretability of\ncomplex models remains a challenge, which limits their utility in medical\napplications. Recently, model-agnostic methods have been proposed to measure\nconditional variable importance and accommodate complex non-linear models.\nHowever, they often lack power when dealing with highly correlated data, a\ncommon problem in medical imaging. We introduce Hierarchical-CPI, a\nmodel-agnostic variable importance measure that frames the inference problem as\nthe discovery of groups of variables that are jointly predictive of the\noutcome. By exploring subgroups along a hierarchical tree, it remains\ncomputationally tractable, yet also enjoys explicit family-wise error rate\ncontrol.

However, these benefits are significantly degraded under\nmobility due to channel aging, and further exacerbated by the unique near-field\n(NF) and spatial non-stationarity (SnS) propagation in such systems. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel channel prediction approach that\nincorporates dedicated channel modeling, probabilistic representations, and\nBayesian inference algorithms for this emerging scenario. Specifically, we\ndevelop tensor-structured channel models in both the spatial-frequency-temporal\n(SFT) and beam-delay-Doppler (BDD) domains, which leverage temporal\ncorrelations among multiple pilot symbols for channel prediction. The factor\nmatrices of multi-linear transformations are parameterized by BDD domain grids\nand SnS factors, where beam domain grids are jointly determined by angles and\nslopes under spatial-chirp based NF representations. To enable tractable\ninference, we replace environment-dependent BDD domain grids with uniformly\nsampled ones, and introduce perturbation parameters in each domain to mitigate\ngrid mismatch. We further propose a hybrid beam domain strategy that integrates\nangle-only sampling with slope hyperparameterization to avoid the computational\nburden of explicit slope sampling. Based on the probabilistic models, we\ndevelop tensor-structured bi-layer inference (TS-BLI) algorithm under the\nexpectation-maximization (EM) framework, which reduces computational complexity\nvia tensor operations by leveraging the bi-layer factor graph for approximate\nE-step inference and an alternating strategy with closed-form updates in the\nM-step.

To overcome\nthe communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,\ndecentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)\ncommunication, has been extensively explored in the research community.\nAlthough researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model\nconvergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost\nalong with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These\ncosts are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each\ntraining round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.\nFurthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments\naffects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity\ndegrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the\ndesign of an effective DFL framework for EC systems.

In this paper, deep learning models are applied to ECG, EEG,\nand human activity signals using actual medical datasets, brain, and heart\nrecordings. The results demonstrate that using a multi-modal approach using\nwavelet transforms improves the accuracy of disease and disorder\nclassification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u53f7\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u533b\u751f\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u964d\u566a\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a2D\u548c3D\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u75be\u75c5\u548c\u969c\u788d\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,\nassuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but\nthe test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,\nMoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are\nhighly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts\nresulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,\ndomain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a\ndomain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.\nSubsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive\ncontrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final\nclassifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and\ndiscriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data\naugmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow\nbetween the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex\nrepresentations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA\nachieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various\nunlabeled ratios in the target domain data.

Besides\nit addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for\nexample, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by\njointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown\nprecoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet\nfollowed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive\n(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet\nchannel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded\nPRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel\nspatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet\nsignificantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a\nwide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB\ngain at high SNRs.

However, most of the conventional deep learning-based SemCom\nsystems focus on analog transmission and lack in compatibility with practical\ndigital communications. This paper proposes a vector quantized-variational\nautoencoder (VQ-VAE) based digital SemCom system that directly transmits the\nsemantic features and incorporates the importance-aware orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing (OFDM) transmission to enhance the SemCom performance,\nwhere the VQ-VAE generates a discrete codebook shared between the transmitter\nand receiver. At transmitter, the latent semantic features are firstly\nextracted by VQ-VAE, and then the shared codebook is adopted to match these\nfeatures, which are subsequently transformed into a discrete version to adapt\nthe digital transmission.

However, many\ndeep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate\non a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and\nrestricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training\nlibraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of\na physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model\nlearns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces\nthe conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of\nthe HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant\nconditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the\nencoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop\naugmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a\npredefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically\nconsistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned\nposterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for\ninterpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based\nmaterial matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material\nmatches for an inferred emissivity distribution.

This allows us to compare\nthe state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing\napproach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)\nspectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are\ndeformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;\nand (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A\nlarge dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an\nexperimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple\nradionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,\nthe statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning\napproaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the\nperformance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when\nspectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum\nstatistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral\nsignatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when\nmeasurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.\nConcerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate\nestimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver\nless satisfactory results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u6216\u5efa\u6a21\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u662f\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6307\u6807\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u03b3\u5c04\u7ebf\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u573a\u666f\u548c\u6307\u6807\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u6216\u5efa\u6a21\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u662f\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3002"}}

This\nwork introduces a patient-adaptive focused transmit scheme that has the ability\nto drastically reduce the number of transmits needed to produce a high-quality\nultrasound image. The method relies on posterior sampling with a temporal\ndiffusion model to perceive and reconstruct the anatomy based on partial\nobservations, while subsequently taking an action to acquire the most\ninformative transmits.

In this approach, each clause - a\nlogical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is\ndisqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict\nrequirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve\ncompetitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine\n(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict.

As a result, each clause\neffectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,\nenabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed\nfuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory\nfootprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the\nIMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a\n50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine.

We\ncompare the system performance of Typical Cellular and Cell-Free Massive MIMO\ndeployments as a vehicle to demonstrate the need for this new metric. We begin\nby providing a concise treatment of items impacting SE by introducing three\ncategories: 5G Radio Resources, Practical Limitations (such as channel matrix\nrank deficiency) and Implementation Losses (SINR degradation). For the example\nRadio Access Technology configuration analyzed, we show 5G yields an RUE of 47%\n(revealing significant room for improvement when defining 6G).

In\nthis paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the\nliterature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic\nregularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces\nsparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT\nin many applications with sparsity requirements.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward\nmodels (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human\nvalues, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical\nfor effective alignment.

A recent line of work mitigates this by using\nsymbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry\nsolver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate\nreasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this\nwork, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with\nformal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with\nincremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning\ntrace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach\nthis behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly\ndeveloped synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and\nautomatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that\njointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through\noutcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named\nGF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS\nbenchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model\nQwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading\nsymbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are\nnoticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive\nanalysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,\ntraining epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\uff08GPS\uff09\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7eaf\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408Chain-of-Thought\uff08CoT\uff09\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u66ff\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u6a21\u578bGF-Reasoner\u5728\u6807\u51c6GPS\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe15%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u7c7b7B\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u768472B\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u66f4\u77ed\u4e14\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u9636\u51e0\u4f55\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}
