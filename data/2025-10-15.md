*Zelin Gan,Henrique Buglia,Romulo Aparecido,Mindaugas Jarmolovičius,Eric Sillekens,Jiaqian Yang,Ronit Sohanpal,Robert I. Killey,Polina Bayvel*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于O波段低色散传输系统中非线性干扰估计的闭式模型，该模型考虑了四波混频效率项以及自相位调制/交叉相位调制的相干贡献，在传统高斯噪声模型受限的场景下能准确评估非线性干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统闭式高斯噪声模型在低色散O波段传输系统中存在局限性，需要开发更准确的非线性干扰估计模型来支持系统优化。

Method: 扩展了闭式模型，纳入四波混频效率项和自相位调制/交叉相位调制的相干贡献，通过分裂步傅里叶方法和数值积分进行验证。

Result: 在41-161个信道、96 GBaud符号率、高达16.1 THz带宽和80-800 km传输距离的测试中，非线性干扰信噪比的均方绝对误差低于0.22 dB。

Conclusion: 所提出的闭式模型为O波段相干传输系统优化提供了高效准确的分析工具。

Abstract: We present a novel closed-form model for nonlinear interference (NLI)
estimation in low-dispersion O-band transmission systems. The formulation
incorporates the four-wave mixing (FWM) efficiency term as well as the coherent
contributions of self- and cross-phase modulation (SPM/XPM) across multiple
identical spans. This extension enables accurate evaluation of the NLI in
scenarios where conventional closed-form Gaussian Noise (GN) models are
limited. The proposed model is validated against split-step Fourier method
(SSFM) simulations and numerical integration across 41-161 channels, with a 96
GBaud symbol rate, bandwidths of up to 16.1 THz, and transmission distances
from 80 to 800 km. Results show a mean absolute error of the NLI
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) below 0.22 dB. The proposed closed-form model
offers an efficient and accurate tool for system optimisation in O-band
coherent transmission.

### [2] [Based on Deep Neural Networks: A Machine Learning-Assisted Channel Estimation Method for MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11891)
*Haoran He*

Main category: eess.SP

Method: 使用多层感知器DNN架构，包含3个隐藏层(256,128,64神经元)，采用ReLU激活函数、Adam优化器和MSE损失函数，从导频信号学习预测信道矩阵。

Result: 在COST 2100数据集上的仿真显示，DNN方法在NMSE和BER指标上均优于传统方法，在中等SNR下NMSE性能提升3-5 dB，在高移动性场景下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了机器学习在无线通信中的集成，有助于下一代网络中高效的资源分配和频谱效率提升。未来可考虑使用更多真实数据集和混合架构来提升泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-assisted channel estimation approach
for massive MIMO systems, leveraging DNNs to outperform traditional LS and MMSE
methods. In 5G and beyond, accurate channel estimation mitigates pilot
contamination and high mobility issues that harm system reliability. The
proposed DNN architecture includes multi-layer perceptrons with ReLU
activation, 3 hidden layers (256, 128, 64 neurons respectively), uses Adam
optimizer (learning rate 1e-4) and MSE loss function. It learns from pilot
signals to predict channel matrices, achieving lower NMSE and BER across
different SNR levels. Simulations use the COST 2100 public standard dataset (a
well-recognized MIMO channel dataset for 5G, not synthetic datasets) with
10,000 samples of 4x4 MIMO channels under urban macro scenarios. Results show
the DNN outperforms LS and MMSE by 3-5 dB in NMSE at medium SNR, with robust
performance in high-mobility scenarios. The study evaluates metrics like NMSE
vs. SNR, BER vs. SNR, and sensitivity to pilot length, antenna configurations,
and computational complexity. The DNN has 2.3 GFlOPs computational complexity,
15.6k parameters, and 1.8 ms inference time on Raspberry Pi 4, verifying
deployment feasibility. This work advances ML integration in wireless
communications, facilitating efficient resource allocation and improved
spectral efficiency in next-generation networks. Future work may use more
real-world datasets and hybrid architectures for better generalization.

### [3] [Using STAR-IRS to Secure Indoor Communications Through Symbol-Level Random Phase Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11925)
*Yanan Du,Zeyang Sun,Yilan Zhang,Sai Xu,Beiyuan Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于同时透射反射智能反射面(STAR-IRS)的安全室内通信方案，使用GNN优化保密速率，并通过FPGA加速器降低计算延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内通信面临的外部窃听风险，传统反射面只能反射信号，无法同时控制透射和反射信号来增强合法用户接收并干扰窃听者。

Method: 部署STAR-IRS在墙壁或窗户上，将入射电磁波动态分为透射和反射两部分：反射信号增强Bob接收，透射信号添加符号级随机相位偏移来恶化Eves信号质量；使用GNN求解保密速率最大化问题，并设计FPGA加速器。

Result: 仿真显示该策略在保密性能上优于传统方案和仅反射方案；GNN方法在求解优化问题时优于MRT、ZF和MMSE等基准技术；实验验证FPGA加速器实现低推理延迟。

Conclusion: STAR-IRS结合GNN优化和FPGA加速是一种有效的室内安全通信解决方案，能同时增强合法用户接收并干扰窃听者，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: This paper proposes a secure indoor communication scheme based on
simultaneous transmitting and reflecting intelligent reflecting surface
(STAR-IRS). Specifically, a transmitter (Alice) sends confidential information
to its intended user (Bob) indoors, while several eavesdroppers (Eves) lurk
outside. To safeguard the transmission from eavesdropping, the STAR-IRS is
deployed on walls or windows. Upon impinging on the STAR-IRS, the incoming
electromagnetic wave is dynamically partitioned into two components, enabling
both transmission through and reflection from the surface. The reflected signal
is controlled to enhance reception at Bob, while the transmitted signal is
modulated with symbol-level random phase shifts to degrade the signal quality
at Eves. Based on such a setting, the secrecy rate maximization problem is
formulated. To solve it, a graph neural network (GNN)-based scheme is
developed. Furthermore, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based GNN
accelerator is designed to reduce computational latency. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms both the conventional scheme
and the reflection-only scheme in terms of secrecy performance. Moreover, the
GNN-based approach achieves superior results compared to benchmark techniques
such as maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero forcing (ZF), and minimum mean
square error (MMSE) in solving the optimization problem. Finally, experimental
evaluations confirm that the FPGA-based accelerator enables low inference
latency.

Abstract: We demonstrate a record-high 62.6 GHz solidly mounted acoustic resonator

piezoelectric layer on a 40 nm buried platinum (Pt) bottom electrode,
positioned above an acoustic Bragg reflector composed of alternating SiO2 (28.2
nm) and Ta2O5 (24.3 nm) layers in 8.5 pairs. The Bragg reflector and
piezoelectric stack above are designed to confine a third-order
thickness-extensional (TE) bulk acoustic wave (BAW) mode, while efficiently
transducing with thickness-field excitation. The fabricated SMR exhibits an
extracted piezoelectric coupling coefficient (k2) of 0.8% and a maximum Bode
quality factor (Q) of 51 at 63 GHz, representing the highest operating

mmWave SMR devices for filters and resonators in next-generation RF front ends.

Conclusion: 多任务学习方法在无线系统中实时脉冲噪声参数估计方面具有有效性。

Abstract: Impulsive noise poses a significant challenge to the reliability of wireless
communication systems, necessitating accurate estimation of its statistical
parameters for effective mitigation. This paper introduces a multitask learning
(MTL) framework based on a CNN-LSTM architecture enhanced with an attention
mechanism for the joint estimation of impulsive noise parameters. The proposed
model leverages a unified weighted-loss function to enable simultaneous
learning of multiple parameters within a shared representation space, improving
learning efficiency and generalization across related tasks. Experimental
results show that the proposed MTL framework achieves stable convergence,
faster training, and enhanced scalability with modest computational overhead.
Benchmarking against conventional single-task learning (STL) models confirms
its favorable complexity-performance trade-off and significant memory savings,
indicating the effectiveness of the MTL approach for real-time impulsive noise
parameter estimation in wireless systems.

### [6] [Probabilistic Constellation Shaping for OFDM ISAC Signals Under Temporal-Frequency Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12204)
*Zhen Du,Jingjing Xu,Yifeng Xiong,Jie Wang,Musa Furkan Keskin,Henk Wymeersch,Fan Liu,Shi Jin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的概率星座整形框架，在保持通信能力的同时提升感知性能，通过优化通信速率并约束感知CSI的均方误差、功率和概率分布来实现灵活的感知与通信权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在6G集成感知与通信中，使用OFDM通信信号进行感知具有成本效益，但QAM等非恒定模调制引入的随机性会显著降低匹配和非匹配滤波方案的感知性能。需要在保持通信随机性的同时提升感知性能。

Method: 提出统一的概率星座整形框架，最大化通信速率，同时约束感知信道状态信息的均方误差、功率和概率分布。该框架兼容匹配和非匹配滤波方案。

Result: 仿真和现场测量验证了所提PCS方法在实现灵活感知与通信权衡方面的有效性，以及在真实场景中增强6G无线传输的可信度。

Conclusion: 所提出的概率星座整形框架能够有效平衡感知与通信性能，为6G集成感知与通信系统提供了一种实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is considered an innovative
technology in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, where utilizing
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals for
sensing provides a cost-effective solution for implementing ISAC. However, the
sensing performance of matched and mismatched filtering schemes can be
significantly deteriorated due to the signaling randomness induced by
finite-alphabet modulations with nonconstant modulus, such as quadrature
amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. Therefore, improving sensing
performance without significantly compromising communication capability (i.e.,
maintaining randomness), remains a challenging task. To that end, we propose a
unified probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) framework that is compatible
with both matched and mismatched filtering schemes, by maximizing the
communication rate while imposing constraints on mean square error (MSE) of
sensing channel state information (CSI), power, and probability distribution.
Specifically, the MSE of sensing CSI is leveraged to optimize sensing
capability, which is illustrated to be a more comprehensive metric compared to
the output SNR after filtering (SNRout) and integrated sidelobes ratio (ISLR).
Additionally, the internal relationships among these three sensing metrics are
explicitly analyzed. Finally, both simulations and field measurements validate
the efficiency of proposed PCS approach in achieving a flexible S&C trade-off,
as well as its credibility in enhancing 6G wireless transmission in real-world
scenarios.

### [7] [Wireless Channel Modeling for Machine Learning -- A Critical View on Standardized Channel Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12279)
*Benedikt Böck,Amar Kasibovic,Wolfgang Utschick*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文指出3GPP标准链路级信道模型在评估机器学习物理层方法时存在局限性，会导致分布偏移和高斯特性，使得ML模型无法超越经典方法。作者提出采用场景级视角可以解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准化链路级信道模型在评估ML物理层方法时存在限制性假设，导致分布偏移和近高斯特性，使得ML模型无法发挥优势。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验证明，在链路级信道模型下，简单线性方法在信道压缩、估计和建模方面是最优的。

Result: 研究发现ML模型在链路级信道模型下无法超越经典线性方法，揭示了这类模型不适合评估ML模型。

Conclusion: 采用场景级视角而非链路级视角可以解决链路级模型的局限性，从而释放ML在物理层应用的潜力。

Abstract: Standardized (link-level) channel models such as the 3GPP TDL and CDL models
are frequently used to evaluate machine learning (ML)-based physical-layer
methods. However, in this work, we argue that a link-level perspective
incorporates limiting assumptions, causing unwanted distributional shifts or
necessitating impractical online training. An additional drawback is that this
perspective leads to (near-)Gaussian channel characteristics. Thus, ML-based
models, trained on link-level channel data, do not outperform classical
approaches for a variety of physical-layer applications. Particularly, we
demonstrate the optimality of simple linear methods for channel compression,
estimation, and modeling, revealing the unsuitability of link-level channel
models for evaluating ML models. On the upside, adopting a scenario-level
perspective offers a solution to this problem and unlocks the relative gains
enabled by ML.

### [8] [A New Method of Constructing Hadamard Matrices, Circulant Hadamard Matrices, CZCS, GCS, CCC, and CZCSS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12315)
*Piyush Priyanshu,Sudhan Majhi,Subhabrata Paul*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用线性算子和广义布尔函数构造8个4阶循环Hadamard矩阵的新方法，并利用这些矩阵递归构造了覆盖所有长度的二进制交叉Z互补集(CZCS)、Golay互补集(GCS)和Hadamard矩阵，填补了二进制CZCS构造的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环Hadamard矩阵在编码理论和信号处理中具有重要应用，但现有的构造方法有限。本文旨在开发新的构造方法来生成循环Hadamard矩阵及其相关的互补序列集，以解决现有构造方法在覆盖长度和参数灵活性方面的不足。

Method: 使用线性算子和广义布尔函数(GBF)构造4阶循环Hadamard矩阵，然后递归地利用这些矩阵构造二进制CZCS、GCS和Hadamard矩阵。还提出了基于循环矩阵的低复杂度替代构造方法。

Result: 成功构造了所有8个4阶循环Hadamard矩阵，并首次实现了覆盖所有长度的二进制CZCS构造。同时构造了具有灵活群大小的二进制GCS和CCC，以及最优的CZCSS。所有构造都是新颖的，参数优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种系统的方法来构造循环Hadamard矩阵和相关互补序列集，填补了二进制CZCS构造的空白。提出的构造方法具有参数灵活性和低复杂度优势，并为Hadamard猜想的研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: A Hadamard matrix $H$ is a square matrix of order $n$ with entries $\pm 1$,
such that $HH^\top=nI_{n}$, where $I_n$ is an identity matrix of order $n$. A
circulant Hadamard matrix $H$ is a Hadamard matrix that has rows of entries in
cyclic order. There exist only $8$ circulant Hadamard matrices of order 4, and
here, we provide a novel construction of all such $8$ circulant Hadamard
matrices using a linear operator and generalized Boolean function (GBF). The
constructed circulant Hadamard matrices are used recursively to construct a
binary cross Z-complementary set (CZCS) of all lengths with an even phase, a
binary Golay complementary set (GCS) of all lengths, and Hadamard matrices of
order $2^{n+2}$, where $n\geq1$. The construction of a binary CZCS covering all
lengths was not available before. We also propose an alternative,
lower-complexity construction of binary GCSs of all lengths and Hadamard
matrices of order $2^{a+1}10^b26^c$ using circulant matrices, where $ a,b,c
\geq 0$. The proposed binary GCS covers all lengths with a flexible flock size.
The constructions of GCS are further extended to form binary complete
complementary code (CCC) of the parameter $(2N,2N,2N)-CCC$ where
$N=2^a10^b26^c, a,b,c \geq 0$. The constructed binary CCC provides a flexible
flock size. The construction of CZCS is further extended to form a binary
optimal cross-Z complementary sequence set (CZCSS) of the parameter $(2^{n+2},
2^{n+2}, 2^{n+2}, 2^{n+1})-CZCSS$, where $n\geq1$. Finally, we provide a
relation between Hadamard matrices and GCS, which enables the study of the
Hadamard conjecture in a new direction. We also provided a few properties of
circulant matrices over aperiodic cross-correlation (ACCF) and aperiodic
auto-correlation (AACF), which are used to prove the theorems. All proposed
constructions are novel, and their parameters are compared with the existing
state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RIS受限于对角散射矩阵，而现有的BD-RIS研究大多依赖简化的信道模型，忽略了实际电磁效应如互耦合和阻抗失配。

Method: 基于多端口网络理论建立物理一致性模型，开发了针对SISO系统的闭式解、针对单流MIMO系统的SDR算法，以及针对多用户MIMO系统的ADMM算法。

Result: 研究表明带状连接RIS与全连接RIS具有相同的信道整形能力，并通过仿真评估了各种电磁效应和近似方法对系统性能的影响。

Conclusion: 在物理一致性模型下，BD-RIS的优化设计能够显著提升系统性能，且带状连接架构具有与全连接架构相同的性能潜力。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for future
wireless communication systems. Conventional RIS is constrained to a diagonal
scattering matrix, which limits its flexibility. Recently, beyond-diagonal RIS
(BD-RIS) has been proposed as a more general RIS architecture class that allows
inter-element connections and shows great potential for performance
improvement. Despite extensive progress on BD-RIS, most existing studies rely
on simplified channel models that ignore practical electromagnetic (EM) effects
such as mutual coupling and impedance mismatching. To address this gap, this
paper investigates the architecture design and optimization of BD-RIS under the
general physics-consistent model derived with multiport network theory in
recent literature. Building on a compact reformulation of this model, we show
that band-connected RIS achieves the same channel-shaping capability as
fully-connected RIS, which extends existing results obtained for conventional
channel models. We then develop optimization methods under the general
physics-consistent model; specifically, we derive closed-form solutions for
single-input single-output (SISO) systems, propose a globally optimal
semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm for single-stream multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems, and design an efficient alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm for multiuser MIMO systems. Using
the proposed algorithms, we conduct comprehensive simulations to evaluate the
impact of various EM effects and approximations, including mutual coupling
among RIS antennas and the commonly adopted unilateral approximation, on system
performance.

Conclusion: HEAR成功解决了EEG设备异构性问题，为EEG基础模型的广泛应用和进一步发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential technique for neuroscience
research and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Recently, large-scale
EEG foundation models have been developed, exhibiting robust generalization
capabilities across diverse tasks and subjects. However, the heterogeneity of
EEG devices not only hinders the widespread adoption of these models but also
poses significant challenges to their further scaling and development. In this
paper, we introduce HEAR, the first EEG foundation model explicitly designed to
support heterogeneous EEG devices, accommodating varying electrode layouts and
electrode counts. HEAR employs a learnable, coordinate-based spatial embedding
to map electrodes with diverse layouts and varying counts into a unified
representational space. This unified spatial representation is then processed
by a novel spatially-guided transformer, which effectively captures
spatiotemporal dependencies across electrodes. To support the development of
HEAR, we construct a large-scale EEG dataset comprising 8,782 hours of data
collected from over 150 distinct electrode layouts with up to 1,132 electrodes.
Experimental results demonstrate that HEAR substantially outperforms existing
EEG foundation models in supporting heterogeneous EEG devices and generalizing
across diverse cognitive tasks and subjects.

Abstract: The emergence of alternative multiplexing domains to the time-frequency
domains, e.g., the delay-Doppler and chirp domains, offers a promising approach
for addressing the challenges posed by complex propagation environments and
next-generation applications. Unlike the time and frequency domains, these
domains offer unique channel representations which provide additional degrees
of freedom (DoF) for modeling, characterizing, and exploiting wireless channel
features. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of channel
characteristics, including delay, Doppler shifts, and channel coefficients
across various domains, with an emphasis on their inter-domain relationships,
shared characteristics, and domain-specific distinctions. We further evaluate
the comparative advantages of each domain under specific channel conditions.
Building on this analysis, we propose a generalized and adaptive transform
domain framework that leverages the pre- and post-processing of the discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) matrix, to enable dynamic transitions between various
domains in response to the channel conditions and system requirements. Finally,
several representative use cases are presented to demonstrate the applicability
of the proposed cross-domain waveform processing framework in diverse
scenarios, along with future directions and challenges.

TL;DR: 提出了一种贝叶斯方法解决多参考对齐问题，使用扩散模型作为数据驱动的即插即用先验，通过样本功率谱进行条件化，在减少所需样本数量的同时实现准确的后验采样和不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有频率方法在极低信噪比下能准确恢复信号，但需要大量样本。本文旨在开发一种方法，通过利用适当先验来显著减少所需样本数量。

Method: 使用扩散模型作为数据驱动的即插即用先验，将其条件化于样本功率谱（一种平移不变统计量），实现准确的后验采样和不确定性量化。

Result: 仿真实验表明，与最先进方法（如期望最大化和双谱反演）相比，该方法显著减少了所需样本数量。

Conclusion: 该方法为其他轨道恢复问题（如冷冻电镜）提供了一个有前景的框架。

Abstract: We propose a Bayesian approach to the problem of multi-reference alignment --
the recovery of signals from noisy, randomly shifted observations. While
existing frequentist methods accurately recover the signal at arbitrarily low
signal-to-noise ratios, they require a large number of samples to do so. In
contrast, our proposed method leverages diffusion models as data-driven
plug-and-play priors, conditioning these on the sample power spectrum (a
shift-invariant statistic) enabling both accurate posterior sampling and
uncertainty quantification. The use of an appropriate prior significantly
reduces the required number of samples, as illustrated in simulation
experiments with comparisons to state-of-the-art methods such as
expectation--maximization and bispectrum inversion. These findings establish
our approach as a promising framework for other orbit recovery problems, such
as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM).

Abstract: This work studies an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework
for targets that are spread both in the angle and range domains. We model each
target using a cluster of rays parameterized by a specific density function,
and propose a truncated Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) spread (TMS)
algorithm to accurately estimate the parameters of the density function. Unlike
the conventional MUSIC spread (CMS), TMS restricts the signal subspace rank
based on the eigen decomposition of the received-signal autocorrelation. We
also propose a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based algorithm for estimating
the distance and range spread of each target. Leveraging these estimates, we
then develop a dynamic transmit beamforming algorithm that successfully
illuminates multiple targets while also serving multiple downlink (DL) users.
Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms over
baseline schemes in both low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes as
well as under a wide angular spread regime.

Abstract: Neurodegeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal
structure or function, is commonly assessed in clinical practice through
reductions in cortical thickness or brain volume, as visualized by structural
MRI. While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical
sophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and
heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy
aging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age
gap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain
age gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's
predicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The
resulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with
recent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and
severity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their
methodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical
populations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces
a principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in
graph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks
(GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the
anatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong
theoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust
estimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP,
machine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path
forward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research
directions in personalized medicine.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了在统计聚类背景下可复现的算法，通过黑盒方式利用组合优化问题的近似算法，实现了统计k-中位数、k-均值和k-中心问题的可复现近似解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Impagliazzo等人引入的可复现性概念，旨在设计在不同输入上执行时能产生相同分区结果的聚类算法，确保算法输出的稳定性。

Method: 使用组合优化问题近似算法的黑盒方法，设计了统计欧几里得k-中位数和k-均值的可复现O(1)近似算法，以及统计欧几里得k-中心的可复现O(1)近似加O(1)加性误差算法。

Result: 实现了统计欧几里得k-中位数和k-均值的可复现O(1)近似算法，样本复杂度为poly(d)；统计欧几里得k-中心的可复现算法样本复杂度为exp(d)。在2D合成分布上的实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 成功设计了统计聚类问题的可复现算法，为k-中位数和k-均值问题提供了高效的解决方案，而k-中心问题虽然可行但样本复杂度较高。

Abstract: We design replicable algorithms in the context of statistical clustering
under the recently introduced notion of replicability from Impagliazzo et al.
[2022]. According to this definition, a clustering algorithm is replicable if,
with high probability, its output induces the exact same partition of the
sample space after two executions on different inputs drawn from the same
distribution, when its internal randomness is shared across the executions. We
propose such algorithms for the statistical $k$-medians, statistical $k$-means,
and statistical $k$-centers problems by utilizing approximation routines for
their combinatorial counterparts in a black-box manner. In particular, we
demonstrate a replicable $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for statistical
Euclidean $k$-medians ($k$-means) with $\operatorname{poly}(d)$ sample
complexity. We also describe an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm with an
additional $O(1)$-additive error for statistical Euclidean $k$-centers, albeit
with $\exp(d)$ sample complexity. In addition, we provide experiments on
synthetic distributions in 2D using the $k$-means++ implementation from sklearn
as a black-box that validate our theoretical results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了几种高效的可复制算法用于学习大间隔半空间问题，改进了之前Impagliazzo等人的工作。设计了首个维度无关的多项式时间可复制算法，在样本复杂度上有所提升，并且在某些参数下达到了最优。

Abstract: We provide efficient replicable algorithms for the problem of learning
large-margin halfspaces. Our results improve upon the algorithms provided by
Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorrell [STOC, 2022]. We design the first
dimension-independent replicable algorithms for this task which runs in
polynomial time, is proper, and has strictly improved sample complexity
compared to the one achieved by Impagliazzo et al. [2022] with respect to all
the relevant parameters. Moreover, our first algorithm has sample complexity
that is optimal with respect to the accuracy parameter $\epsilon$. We also
design an SGD-based replicable algorithm that, in some parameters' regimes,
achieves better sample and time complexity than our first algorithm. Departing
from the requirement of polynomial time algorithms, using the
DP-to-Replicability reduction of Bun, Gaboardi, Hopkins, Impagliazzo, Lei,
Pitassi, Sorrell, and Sivakumar [STOC, 2023], we show how to obtain a
replicable algorithm for large-margin halfspaces with improved sample
complexity with respect to the margin parameter $\tau$, but running time doubly
exponential in $1/\tau^2$ and worse sample complexity dependence on $\epsilon$
than one of our previous algorithms. We then design an improved algorithm with
better sample complexity than all three of our previous algorithms and running
time exponential in $1/\tau^{2}$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaRL是一个双层优化框架，通过自适应调整策略的秩来提升强化学习的鲁棒性，避免过度保守的策略和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒强化学习方法依赖嵌套最小-最大优化，计算成本高且产生过于保守的策略。

Method: 采用双层优化：下层在固定秩约束下优化策略，上层自适应调整秩以平衡偏差-方差权衡，将策略参数投影到低秩流形上。

Result: 在MuJoCo连续控制基准测试中，AdaRL不仅优于固定秩基线和最先进的鲁棒RL方法，还能收敛到任务的内在秩。

Conclusion: 自适应低秩策略表示为模型不确定性下的鲁棒RL提供了高效且原则性的替代方案。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

*Qingwen Li,Xiaohang Zhao,Xiao Han,Hailiang Huang,Lanjuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor是一个用于ICU死亡率预测的框架，通过原型学习实现内在可解释性，整合了临床病程识别、人口统计学异质性和预后意识三个关键决策要素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU死亡率预测不仅需要预测准确性，还需要可解释性来建立临床信任和满足监管要求。现有方法主要关注人口统计学异质性，忽视了临床病程识别和预后意识。

Method: ProtoDoctor包含两个关键创新模块：预后临床病程识别模块（通过原型学习识别临床病程，并使用新的正则化机制实现预后意识）和人口统计学异质性识别模块（通过队列特定原型和风险调整建模人口异质性）。

Result: 广泛的实证评估表明ProtoDoctor在预测准确性上优于最先进的基线方法。人工评估进一步证实其解释在临床上更有意义、更可信且更适用于ICU实践。

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor成功地将ICU决策实践的三个关键要素整合到其推理过程中，在保持高预测准确性的同时提供了临床上有意义的解释。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

TL;DR: 该论文对Mamba模型的上下文学习能力进行了理论分析，证明其能够通过测试时特征学习高效地提取相关特征方向，在单索引模型任务中达到与非线性Transformer相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba作为新兴的线性时间序列模型，虽然计算效率高且实证表现优异，但其理论基础仍然有限，特别是对上下文学习机制的理解不足。

Method: 研究Mamba在低维非线性目标函数任务中的上下文学习能力，特别关注单索引模型y≈g*(⟨β,x⟩)，分析Mamba通过梯度预训练后如何通过测试时特征学习提取相关方向β。

Result: 证明Mamba能够实现高效的上下文学习，其测试时样本复杂度优于线性Transformer（表现为核方法），与非线性Transformer相当，能够突破CSQ下界并接近信息理论最优速率。

Conclusion: 非线性门控机制是Mamba实现特征提取的关键，这解释了Mamba在保持计算效率的同时获得高性能的根本原因。

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

TL;DR: 提出GAR框架，通过对抗性训练联合优化问题生成器和求解器，实现隐式课程学习，提升数学定理证明的训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于固定问题集的强化学习方法训练效率低，难以处理复杂问题，需要更有效的训练框架。

Method: GAR框架包含问题生成器和求解器，在对抗循环中共同训练，通过隐式课程学习机制使问题难度与证明能力同步演进。

Result: 在MiniF2F-Test基准上平均相对提升4.20%，ProofNet-Test上pass@32从22.58%提升至25.81%。

Conclusion: GAR建立了可验证环境下问题生成与求解协同进化的一般强化学习范式，超越了形式化证明的应用范围。

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) 是一种优化器无关的改进方法，仅在参数坐标符号与优化器更新一致时应用权重衰减，无需额外超参数调优即可提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解耦衰减隐式优化正则化或约束目标，而CWD旨在保持原始损失函数，寻找未修改目标的局部帕累托最优驻点。

Method: CWD是一种单行修改，仅对符号与优化器更新一致的参数坐标应用权重衰减，可解释为双层次优化，在达到平稳流形时诱导滑模行为。

Result: 在语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类任务中，CWD在百万到十亿参数规模上持续改善最终损失和准确率。

Conclusion: CWD是AdamW、Lion和Muon等优化器的即插即用改进，无需新超参数或额外调优即可提升模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

TL;DR: Janus框架通过结合欧几里得和双曲图神经网络，利用多视图节点表示和对比学习来检测图数据中的异常节点，在多个真实数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 节点级异常检测面临结构模式和特征分布多样性的挑战，在欺诈检测、网络安全和推荐系统等应用中至关重要。现有方法难以同时捕捉复杂的结构异常和特征异常。

Method: 提出Janus框架：1）为每个节点创建两个视图（原始特征和基于随机游走、度数的结构特征）；2）分别嵌入到欧几里得和双曲空间；3）使用多图自编码器框架，通过对比学习目标作为正则化项，对齐两个空间的嵌入；4）难以对齐的节点被识别为异常。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，Janus始终优于浅层和深层基线方法，证明了结合多种几何表示能够有效识别图中微妙和复杂的异常。

Conclusion: 结合欧几里得和双曲几何表示提供了鲁棒且有效的节点异常检测方法，多视图对比学习能够有效识别难以在不同几何空间中协调的异常节点。

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CrossAD框架，通过跨尺度关联和跨窗口建模进行时间序列异常检测，在多尺度建模中显式捕捉动态的跨尺度关联，并克服固定窗口大小的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多尺度建模时往往独立处理各尺度信息或使用简单特征融合，忽略了异常发生时跨尺度关联的动态变化，且大多基于固定滑动窗口，限制了上下文信息的全面捕捉。

Method: 提出跨尺度重构方法，从粗粒度序列重构细粒度序列以显式捕捉跨尺度关联；设计查询库并融入全局多尺度上下文来克服固定窗口大小的限制。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上使用九种评估指标进行广泛实验，验证了CrossAD的有效性，展示了在异常检测方面的最先进性能。

Conclusion: CrossAD框架通过考虑跨尺度关联和跨窗口建模，在时间序列异常检测中取得了优异性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典薛定谔桥问题在实践中的硬终端约束会导致高维或数据稀缺情况下的不稳定性，需要更灵活的方法来支持稳健的生成建模。

Method: 采用软约束薛定谔桥问题框架，将终端约束替换为一般惩罚函数，构建McKean-Vlasov类型的随机控制公式，并基于Doob h-变换表示、薛定谔势稳定性、Gamma收敛和新型不动点论证进行分析。

Result: 证明了所有惩罚水平下最优解的存在性，并证明当惩罚增加时，控制和价值函数以线性速率收敛到经典薛定谔桥问题的对应值。

Conclusion: 软约束桥不仅提供了首个定量收敛保证，还揭示了惩罚正则化如何支持稳健的生成建模、微调和迁移学习。

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 理解训练样本如何影响模型预测行为对分析和改进机器学习系统至关重要，但现有影响估计方法在大模型上要么精度低要么计算成本过高。

Method: 基于训练和测试数据上中间检查点的损失值以及检查点本身，开发零阶近似方法，无需梯度或逆Hessian计算。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模语言模型的训练数据影响分析提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案，即使对于不可微损失函数也适用。

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition
of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision
boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the
homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw
similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Boundary Guidance方法，通过强化学习微调生成模型，使其远离安全分类器的决策边界，从而同时提高输出的安全性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过微调生成模型来降低被安全分类器过滤的概率，但这种方法往往使模型产生靠近分类器决策边界的样本，导致假阳性和假阴性增加。

Method: 使用强化学习微调方法，明确引导生成远离分类器的边界区域。

Result: 在越狱和模糊提示的基准测试中，Boundary Guidance通过LLM-as-a-Judge评估显示，同时改善了输出的安全性和实用性。

Conclusion: 在不同模型规模和奖励设计上的全面消融实验证明了该方法的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

*Yu-Hsiang Wang,Olgica Milenkovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WaveletDiff是一种在时间序列生成中结合小波变换和扩散模型的新框架，通过多分辨率结构生成高质量的合成时间序列数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列生成模型局限于时域或频域，难以再现真实世界时间序列固有的多尺度结构，而大型高质量时间序列数据集稀缺。

Method: 在小波系数上训练扩散模型，使用专用Transformer处理每个分解层级，通过跨层级注意力机制实现时频尺度间的选择性信息交换，并基于Parseval定理加入能量保持约束。

Result: 在能源、金融和神经科学领域的六个真实数据集上测试，WaveletDiff在五个性能指标上始终优于最先进的时域和频域生成方法，判别分数和Context-FID分数平均比次优基线小3倍。

Conclusion: WaveletDiff通过利用小波的多分辨率结构，能够有效生成高质量的时间序列数据，在多个领域和指标上表现优异。

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了语言模型持续预训练中回放比例配置与计算预算的平衡问题，通过系统实验找到了在有限计算资源下平衡任务性能与知识保留的最优配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在适应新任务时面临学习新能力与避免灾难性遗忘的权衡，现有方法对计算约束下的最优回放比例配置理解不足。

Method: 使用bAbI推理任务作为目标，应用合成数据生成技术，系统评估不同总token预算和回放比例配置对任务掌握和知识保留的影响。

Result: 实验揭示了平衡任务特定性能与通用知识保留的最优配置，显著降低了训练成本。

Conclusion: 基于实证研究结果，提供了根据计算预算选择回放比例的实用指南，使实践者能够以显著降低的训练成本实现强大的任务适应。

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

Motivation: 利用开源视觉语言模型理解复杂主观的多模态现象（如讽刺），评估其在零样本、单样本和少样本提示下的表现。

Method: 使用7个最先进的VLMs（BLIP2、InstructBLIP、OpenFlamingo、LLaVA、PaliGemma、Gemma3、Qwen-VL），在三个基准讽刺数据集（Muse、MMSD2.0、SarcNet）上进行零样本、单样本和少样本提示测试。

Result: 当前模型在二元讽刺检测方面取得中等成功，但在生成高质量解释方面表现不佳，需要任务特定微调。

Conclusion: 开源视觉语言模型在多模态讽刺检测方面有潜力，但在解释生成能力上仍需改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

Motivation: 流程通常是资源驱动的，理解并纳入参与者行为对预测至关重要。现有研究虽然考虑了参与者行为的某些方面，但将其作为时变信号在预测流程监控中的作用仍然有限。

Method: 使用真实事件日志构建包含吞吐时间和参与者中心特征（参与者参与度、继续/中断/交接行为频率及其持续时间）的多变量时间序列，训练和比较多个模型来研究添加参与者行为的好处。

Result: 包含参与者行为的模型在RMSE、MAE和R2指标上始终优于仅包含吞吐时间特征的基线模型。

Conclusion: 将参与者行为随时间建模并纳入预测模型，能够提升性能指标预测的表现。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

*Rita T. Sousa,Heiko Paulheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成显式负声明到知识嵌入学习的新方法，使用双模型架构分别训练正负陈述，通过相互评分选择负样本，在链接预测和三元组分类任务上超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图嵌入方法大多依赖封闭世界假设，将缺失三元组视为假，这与现实世界知识图的开放世界假设不符。显式负声明能帮助区分假三元组和未知三元组，但很少被包含在知识图中且在嵌入训练中被忽视。

Method: 采用双模型架构，两个嵌入模型并行训练，一个处理正陈述，另一个处理负陈述。训练时每个模型通过破坏正样本生成负样本，并用另一个模型评分选择最可能的候选。

Result: 在通用和领域特定知识图上进行广泛实验，专注于链接预测和三元组分类任务，结果表明该方法比最先进的嵌入模型具有更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 将有意义负知识集成到嵌入学习中具有重要价值，能显著提升知识图嵌入的性能表现。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer架构已成功应用于序列决策，但基于序列建模的强化学习方法在对抗鲁棒性方面尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 将每个阶段的对抗交互建模为阶段博弈，定义基于后续状态最大期望值的收益函数，并基于阶段博弈的NashQ值来训练Transformer策略。

Result: CART在对抗性随机游戏中实现了更准确的极小极大值估计，并在各种环境中持续获得更优的最坏情况回报。

Conclusion: CART框架成功增强了决策变换器的对抗鲁棒性，同时保持对状态转移不确定性的保守性。

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界系统中需要同时捕捉个人事件和关系事件，但现有工作很少将它们一起考虑，通常将用户行为简化为单一形式化表示（序列或图）。

Method: 引入包含个人和关系事件的数据集集合，提出统一的形式化框架，并通过实验验证模型能从整合两种事件类型中获益。

Result: 实证结果表明，整合两种事件类型的模型表现更好，但当前方法仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: 发布了相关资源以支持统一用户事件建模的进一步研究，并鼓励该方向的发展。

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆等痴呆症在EEG中表现出重叠的电生理特征，现有基于EEG的方法受限于全频带分析，难以精确区分痴呆亚型和严重程度阶段。

Method: 使用多粒度transformer提取四个频带的多尺度时间模式，然后采用高斯马尔可夫随机场先验的变分图卷积编码器，通过结构化变分推理和自适应门控将神经专业化与生理意义的EEG频带联系起来。

Conclusion: VMoGE为全面痴呆诊断和监测提供了有效的EEG生物标志物发现方法，具有优越性能和临床可解释性。

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that
challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by
full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia
subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural
experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification
with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and
staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale
temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph
convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through
structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural
specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on
two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging,
VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights
through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial
patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker
discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

Motivation: 传统室内Wi-Fi定位方法对环境动态、信道传播特性和硬件异构性敏感，需要大量人工校准，且在设备、信道或部署条件变化时性能迅速下降。

Method: 通过在不同Wi-Fi数据集上微调LLM，Locaris学习从原始信号直接到设备位置的轻量级可泛化映射，将每个AP测量视为token进行处理。

Result: 实验表明Locaris在各类遥测数据上匹配或超越现有技术，仅需少量校准点即可在未见过的设备和部署场景中保持高精度，实现亚米级精度。

Conclusion: 紧凑型LLM可作为室内定位的校准自由回归模型，在大规模部署中提供可扩展和鲁棒的跨环境性能，支持缺失AP和所有可用遥测数据。

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

Motivation: 解决RestartQ-UCB算法中存在的两个核心问题：完全遗忘（重启后丢失所有环境信息）和固定时间重启（不考虑策略与当前环境动态的兼容性）。

Method: 引入了三种重启方法：部分重启、自适应重启和选择性重启，用于改进RestartQ-UCB和RANDOMIZEDQ算法。

Result: 在多种不同环境中实现了接近最优的实证性能，相对于RestartQ-UCB将动态遗憾降低了高达91%。

Conclusion: 提出的三种重启范式有效解决了非平稳强化学习中的重启设计问题，显著提升了算法性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output
precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse}
(bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding
neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if
$f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for
every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in
Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the
discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields
a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy
$\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to
compositional approximation rates

Conclusion: 这项工作为表示工程提供了基础工具，为模型可识别性和因果推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

Motivation: 现代连续时间生成模型通常采用V形传输，每个样本独立沿直线轨迹从先验到数据，忽略了共享结构。

Result: 在合成、图像和生物数据集上，Y流恢复了层次感知结构，在分布指标上优于强流基线方法，并以更少的积分步骤达到目标。

Conclusion: Y形生成流通过共享路径和速度驱动的传输成本，有效捕捉数据中的层次结构，提高了生成模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the

aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration

that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

Motivation: 当前Transformer理解方法缺乏数学框架来建模各层如何促进状态转换，受量子力学与语言模型内在概率性的相似性启发，寻求跨学科视角来理解Transformer。

Method: 将Transformer的隐层激活转换为希尔伯特空间状态向量，将隐藏层重新定义为酉算子和哈密顿量，应用玻恩规则获得最终概率分布。

Result: 通过玩具Transformer的概念验证，展示了QLENS在探究模型预测轨迹中各层影响的潜力。

Conclusion: QLENS为跨领域洞察提供了基础，有助于更广泛地理解Transformer模型。

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CW-DPO是一种两阶段的视觉语言模型对齐方法，通过温和负样本的监督微调和使用冷却权重调节的DPO目标，实现更稳定的优化和更好的校准效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于偏好的视觉语言模型微调方法存在脆弱性，琐碎的错误负样本会注入无信息梯度，导致训练不稳定。

Method: 第一阶段使用温和负样本进行监督微调，第二阶段在DPO目标中应用冷却权重机制，根据模型对负样本的平均token对数概率来抑制无信息梯度。

Result: CW-DPO在各种VLM任务中实现了更稳定的优化、更好的校准和更高的成对胜率，同时收敛步数更少。

Conclusion: 在冷却偏好之前平滑学习动态是进行稳健VLM对齐的简单通用原则。

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

Abstract: Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with
gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their
biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature
achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves
the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward
bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural
dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple
machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we
identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random
asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the
number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a
phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated
fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the
overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters
appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple
asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling
threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible
algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are
mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external
stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We
show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages
depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association
capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the
strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase
transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for
its emergence.

Method: 比较使用精确Hessian矩阵和拟牛顿方法（近似Hessian）在神经网络训练中的表现，分析失败模式。

Result: 使用精确曲率信息时神经网络训练可靠地失败，而拟牛顿方法表现良好，这表明损失景观中可能没有传统认为的众多局部最小值。

Conclusion: 精确二阶信息在神经网络训练中的失败揭示了非线性离散化的几何特性和驻点分布的新见解，挑战了损失景观充满局部最小值的传统观点。

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

Conclusion: MEASURE框架通过有效减少领域相关信息同时保留必要特征，显著提升了睡眠分期模型的领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our

Conclusion: 神经网络训练过程中样本间影响力是动态变化的，这种变化与模型的发展阶段和学习层次结构直接相关。

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one
sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages
that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a
framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory.
We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips
and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these
predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic
shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a
semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in
language models, where token-level influence changes align with known
developmental stages.

TL;DR: GraphShaper是一个几何感知的图基础模型框架，通过多几何专业化解决现有方法在结构边界处的性能下降问题，在零样本设置下显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的图表示学习方法假设所有图结构都能在单一欧几里得空间中编码，但在结构边界处会出现超过20个百分点的准确率损失。树结构需要双曲几何来保持层次分支，而循环模式依赖球形几何的闭合特性，单一几何空间无法解决这些冲突约束。

Method: GraphShaper采用多几何专业化方法，使用针对不同几何空间的专家网络，基于局部结构特征动态计算融合权重，自适应地整合几何属性，在文本嵌入对齐前保持结构完整性。

Result: 在零样本设置下，GraphShaper在引文网络上实现9.47%的准确率提升，在社交网络上实现7.63%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: GraphShaper证明了通过尊重图结构内在几何多样性的对齐框架设计，能够有效解决结构边界处的性能下降问题，显著提升图基础模型的跨域表示学习能力。

Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning
transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods
leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared
representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic
evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries
where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20
percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods
assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In
reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical
branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure
properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric
constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial
challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the
intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce
\textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding
through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks
tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to
adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural
characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before
alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and
7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本属性图的零样本学习中存在过度抽象问题，特别是在异配图上难以识别细粒度模式。通过理论和实证分析发现，当前方法在过大的双曲半径下操作，将多尺度结构信息压缩为统一的高层抽象，导致关键局部模式丢失。

Method: 提出H4G框架，使用可学习的块对角缩放矩阵和Möbius矩阵乘法系统性地降低嵌入半径，恢复对细粒度模式的访问，同时以最小计算开销保持全局感知能力。

Result: 实验显示H4G在零样本性能上达到最先进水平，在异配图上提升12.8%，在同配图上提升8.4%。

Conclusion: 半径缩减能够实现忠实多尺度表示，推动零样本图学习的发展。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

TL;DR: Chimera是一个统一模型，通过状态空间模型直接融入数据拓扑结构，无需领域特定偏置，在语言、视觉和图数据上均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer方法依赖自注意力机制，将数据视为无序集合，忽略了邻域结构或图拓扑，需要设计任务特定的偏置（如位置嵌入、随机游走），这不仅费时且可能阻碍泛化能力。

Method: 将状态空间模型（自然不需要位置嵌入）推广到捕获任意图拓扑，并提出算法优化：对于有向无环图可实现线性时间递归，对于一般图通过数学松弛达到Transformer的二次复杂度。

Result: 在GLUE上比BERT高0.7分，在ImageNet-1k上比ViT高2.6%，在长程图基准测试中超越所有基线。

Conclusion: 验证了Chimera的核心贡献，支持数据拓扑是跨模态的强大归纳偏置这一观点。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

Conclusion: nuGPR框架通过数值线性代数技术和GPU并行化，有效解决了GPR的高计算成本问题，为大规模GPR应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

Method: 提出故意公平性攻击，恶意客户端在训练时增加公平性损失，通过优化公平性指标（如人口统计均等和均等化几率）来生成有偏模型。

Result: 攻击效果显著，即使只有一个恶意客户端，也能将偏见增加高达90%，同时保持全局准确率，难以被检测。

Conclusion: 该攻击对现有的拜占庭鲁棒和公平感知聚合方案构成威胁，揭示了联邦学习系统在公平性方面的脆弱性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究在生存数据集的预算学习问题，提出了一种能够处理右删失数据的预算学习算法，通过付费获取部分标签信息来改进模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生存数据集中存在大量右删失实例，传统监督学习无法充分利用这些信息。预算学习可以通过付费获取更多标签信息，但现有方法未考虑生存数据的特殊性质。

Method: 提出了一种适用于生存数据的预算学习算法，允许学习者付费获取删失实例的更多信息（如实际时间或延长观察期），算法的时间复杂度与标准主动学习方法BatchBALD相当。

Result: 在多个生存任务上的实证分析表明，该方法在多个基准测试中优于其他潜在方法，同时提供了与BatchBALD相当的边界和时间复杂度保证。

Conclusion: 该研究为生存数据集的预算学习提供了理论和实验基础，证明了在考虑数据收集现实约束的情况下，通过智能预算分配可以有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

*Zhongwei Yu,Wannian Xia,Xue Yan,Bo Xu,Haifeng Zhang,Yali Du,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个最小化的推理框架，支持小型transformer进行基本自验证反思，证明自验证反思在验证错误有界时能保证改进，实验显示小模型在整数乘法和数独任务中达到LLM级别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在推理过程中会进行反思和自我验证，但LLMs检测CoT中错误的能力有限，反思如何带来实际改进仍不明确。

Method: 设计了一个最小化推理框架，支持小型transformer进行基本自验证反思，避免使用自然语言以确保分析清晰度和降低实验成本。

Result: 实验证明小transformer在训练和反思执行中都受益于自验证，在整数乘法和数独任务中达到LLM级别性能；强化学习虽然提高分布内性能并激励频繁反思，但主要优化浅层统计模式而非真正减少验证错误。

Conclusion: 将生成式transformer与判别式验证相结合，本质上促进了CoT推理，这种优势与模型规模和自然语言无关。

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文对元学习样本重加权方法在标签噪声下的训练动态进行了理论分析，揭示了其三个训练阶段，并提出了一种轻量级替代方法，在噪声标签基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的元学习样本重加权方法虽然能利用少量干净样本来指导训练，但其行为和训练动态缺乏理论理解，需要深入分析其在标签噪声下的工作机制。

Method: 首先对元重加权方法进行严格的理论分析，揭示其训练轨迹的三个阶段；然后基于分析提出轻量级替代方法，集成均值中心化、行偏移和标签符号调制，避免昂贵的双层优化。

Result: 在合成和真实噪声标签基准测试中，提出的方法始终优于强重加权/选择基线方法，性能更稳定。

Conclusion: 元重加权的训练动态包含三个明确阶段，其机制基于训练信号与干净子集信号的相似性加权耦合；提出的轻量级替代方法能获得更稳定的性能，避免计算开销。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

TL;DR: 提出DE3S方法，通过双增强软形状学习框架解决医疗早期时间序列分类中的准确性和及时性冲突问题，在六个真实医疗数据集上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗应用中的早期时间序列分类（如ICU脓毒症预测）对时间敏感场景至关重要，但面临准确性和及时性的冲突目标，现有方法往往牺牲一个换取另一个，且难以捕捉早期微弱信号和类别不平衡问题。

Method: 提出DE3S框架，包含三个创新：1）结合传统时间增强和基于注意力的全局时间增强的双增强策略；2）基于注意力分数的软形状稀疏化机制；3）双路径专家混合网络和多尺度Inception模块融合架构。

Result: 在六个真实医疗数据集上的广泛实验显示达到最先进性能，消融研究确认了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: DE3S方法通过精确发现形状子模式，有效解决了医疗早期时间序列分类中的关键挑战，在准确性和及时性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion框架，通过Koopman算子理论将非线性扩散动态提升到线性潜在空间，实现单步采样和可解释的生成轨迹，解决了扩散模型采样速度慢与可解释性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但迭代去噪过程导致采样速度慢。现有单步方法虽然加速推理，但牺牲了扩散动态的可解释性和细粒度控制能力，这是实现可编辑生成等应用的关键优势。

Method: 基于Koopman算子理论，将非线性扩散动态提升到潜在空间，其中演化由全局线性算子控制，实现闭式轨迹解。设计了分层架构，通过尺度特定的Koopman子空间在不同空间分辨率上解耦生成动态，系统捕获从粗到细的细节。

Result: Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion不仅实现了具有竞争力的单步生成性能，还通过谱分析提供了理解和操作生成过程的原则性机制。

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了扩散模型中快速采样和可解释性之间的差距，为生成建模中的可解释图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-LLMs结合图结构和文本语义，虽然提升了表达能力，但也引入了新的安全漏洞。现有攻击方法只针对结构或文本单一方面，缺乏统一的多维度攻击框架。

Method: IMDGA框架包含三个紧密集成的模块，在保持可解释性的同时，对图结构和文本特征进行多级扰动攻击。

Result: 通过理论分析和多数据集、多架构的实证评估，IMDGA在可解释性、攻击效果、隐蔽性和鲁棒性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了Graph-LLMs中先前未被充分探索的语义维度漏洞，为提升其安全性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and
resources are publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)方法，为每个分子图生成独特的低秩适配权重，动态注入冻结的LLM中，实现实例特定的分子结构对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理分子图结构时存在两个主要限制：1) 跨所有分子输入优化共享参数空间，限制了模型捕捉实例特定结构特征的能力；2) 为分子任务微调LLM可能导致灾难性遗忘，削弱其通用推理能力。

Method: MoRA为每个输入分子图生成独特的低秩适配权重，这些权重动态注入冻结的LLM中，使模型能够根据每个分子输入的结构调整推理，同时保留LLM的核心知识。

Result: 在化学反应预测和分子描述等关键分子任务上，MoRA的实例特定动态适配优于静态适配基线，包括反应预测精确匹配相对提升14.1%，量子性质预测误差减少22%。

Conclusion: MoRA通过实例特定的参数空间对齐方法，有效解决了分子图结构与LLM整合的挑战，在保持LLM通用推理能力的同时提升了分子任务的性能。

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

Motivation: 在表演性学习中，数据分布会因部署的模型而改变（如用户策略性调整特征），这比传统监督学习更复杂。需要同时考虑模型优化和分布变化的影响。

Method: 使用高维岭回归分析正则化对表演性效应的影响，通过理论分析和实证评估确定最优正则化参数。

Result: 表演性效应在总体设置中会恶化测试风险，但在过参数化情况下可能有益。最优正则化强度与表演性效应强度成正比。

Conclusion: 正则化能有效应对表演性效应，可通过设置与表演性效应强度成正比的正则化参数来优化模型性能。

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively
maintaining a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ChangfuXu/D4RL-FTD) for
papers and other related resources to apply DMs for RL.

Motivation: 现有LoRA重用方法依赖显式任务标签或额外训练，不适用于实际部署，且通常激活固定数量的整个LoRA模块，导致参数冗余或不足而降低性能。

Method: 定义rank-one components (ROCs)，将每个rank参数视为独立单元。在序列级别自适应选择LoRA子集并确定ROC分配，在token级别进一步细化路由，仅激活最相关的ROCs。

Result: 在领域泛化任务中取得显著改进，准确率比现有最优方法提升高达55%，同时保持相当的推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: HiLoRA提供了一种无需训练的高效LoRA重用方法，通过分层路由机制实现了更好的领域泛化性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用多智能体协调结构和置换对称性，显著提升了自改进范式的效率和性能

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

Result: 在五个案例研究（十个数值示例）中验证了GFF-PIELM的可行性，涉及高频、变频、多尺度行为、不规则边界和反问题。相比传统PIELM，显著提高了预测精度，且不增加训练时间和架构复杂度。

Conclusion: PIELM可以扩展到高精度求解高频和变频PDE，提出的初始化策略可能进一步启发其他物理信息机器学习框架的进展。

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了DeepSPI算法，将安全策略改进理论扩展到在线强化学习环境，结合世界模型和表示学习，确保策略更新的单调改进和收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全策略改进理论主要关注离线、表格化强化学习，需要将其扩展到通用在线设置，结合世界模型和表示学习。

Method: 开发理论框架，限制策略更新在当前策略的明确定义邻域内，确保单调改进和收敛。引入DeepSPI算法，结合局部转移和奖励损失与正则化策略更新。

Result: 在ALE-57基准测试中，DeepSPI匹配或超越了PPO和DeepMDPs等强基线方法，同时保持理论保证。

Conclusion: 成功将安全策略改进理论扩展到在线强化学习，通过结合表示学习和世界模型，实现了具有理论保证的高性能算法。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的降雨预测，特别是极端事件的预测，在气候学和地球系统中仍然是一个重大挑战。传统机器学习模型在极端事件预测方面存在局限性。

Method: 使用图注意力网络与长短期记忆网络(Attention-LSTM)结合，利用从简单地形降水物理公式导出的初始边特征，并采用空间季节感知广义帕累托分布方法进行峰值超阈值映射。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在大多数地区（包括易发极端事件的区域）优于现有基准模型，与最先进技术保持强竞争力，相比SEAS5操作预报系统改进了极端事件预测。

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a
significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents
novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value
analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across
Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge
stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers
explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices
that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention
Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention
mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple
orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently
processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold
(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto
Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional
machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to
extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared
with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application
improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce
fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water
management.

TL;DR: 首次对具有演化奖励函数的单时间尺度actor-critic算法进行有限时间收敛性分析，在马尔可夫采样下证明了O(1/√T)的收敛速率，与静态奖励的最佳速率匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实用的强化学习算法使用演化奖励函数（如奖励塑形、熵正则化、课程学习），但缺乏理论分析基础。

Method: 在马尔可夫采样下分析单时间尺度actor-critic算法，考虑每个时间步都可能变化的奖励参数对策略优化和价值估计的影响。

Result: 在标准假设下，推导了actor和critic误差的非渐近界，证明只要奖励参数演化足够慢，就能达到O(1/√T)的收敛速率。

Conclusion: 为许多流行的RL技术提供了理论基础，同时在静态奖励情况下改进了分布不匹配分析，将最佳已知速率提高了log²T倍。

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

<details>

Motivation: 随着用户越来越多地使用私有信息与LLMs交互，安全加密通信变得至关重要。同态加密虽然能直接在加密数据上计算，但文本生成特别是下一个令牌预测在HE下的实现仍是一个关键障碍。

Method: 采用基于旅行商问题(TSP)的令牌重排序策略来处理加密文本生成的困难，并加入后处理步骤进一步减少近似误差。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，该方法能防止崩溃，提高生成文本的连贯性，并在整个过程中保持数据隐私。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了实用且保护隐私的LLM推理的可行性。

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

Motivation: 传统错误检测方法主要关注单一模态（如表数据），难以处理电子商务和医疗等领域中图像、表格和文本数据共存的跨模态错误问题。

Method: 在四个数据集上对五种基线方法进行基准测试，包括Cleanlab标签错误检测框架和DataScope数据评估方法，结合AutoML框架进行评估。

Result: Cleanlab和DataScope在结合强AutoML框架时获得最高的F1分数，表现最佳。

Conclusion: 当前方法在处理重尾现实世界数据时仍有局限性，需要在这一领域进行进一步研究。

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效预训练异构图神经网络，解决语义不匹配问题，学习到具有更好可迁移性的知识。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

Motivation: 当前用于评估生成式AI模型的无机晶体材料的主要距离函数存在四个关键问题：无法量化化合物间相似度、不能区分成分差异和结构差异、缺乏对原子坐标位移的Lipschitz连续性、以及独特性度量对生成样本排列不具不变性。

Method: 提出两种连续距离函数来评估生成模型的独特性和新颖性，这些距离函数理论上克服了传统方法的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，新提出的距离函数能够揭示传统距离函数遗漏的洞察，为评估和比较无机晶体生成模型提供了更可靠的基础。

Conclusion: 连续距离函数为生成式AI模型在无机晶体材料领域的评估提供了更准确和可靠的度量标准，有助于推动材料科学中生成模型的发展。

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

TL;DR: 提出基于高斯过程的非参数动态定价方法，使用贝叶斯优化来学习未知需求函数，在无限和有限库存场景中都优于传统强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态定价方法通常假设需求函数具有特定参数形式，这在现实场景中可能不成立，限制了方法的适用性。需要一种避免限制性建模假设的方法。

Method: 使用高斯过程对需求函数进行非参数建模，将其视为价格的未知黑盒函数，基于贝叶斯优化开发定价算法，适用于无限和有限库存两种场景。

Result: 实验表明，基于贝叶斯优化的方法在收入方面优于多种最先进的强化学习算法，需要更少假设且具有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化是复杂不确定环境中动态定价的强大实用工具，能够提供后悔保证并量化学习效率。

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了平坦最小值与泛化性能的关系，提出尖锐性应被视为函数依赖属性而非泛化差的可靠指标。研究发现正则化会导致更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值往往伴随更好的泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平坦最小值与泛化性能的关联在近期研究中变得更加复杂，出现了理论反例和实证例外。本文旨在重新探讨尖锐性在模型性能中的作用。

Method: 进行了广泛的实证研究，从单目标优化到现代图像分类任务，比较了不同正则化方法（如SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）下的损失景观几何特性。

Result: 正则化模型倾向于收敛到更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值在泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性方面表现更好。无正则化的基线模型收敛到更平坦的最小值，但在所有安全指标上表现更差。

Conclusion: 函数复杂性而非平坦性单独决定了解的几何特性，尖锐最小值可以反映更合适的归纳偏置（特别是在正则化下），需要对损失景观几何进行以函数为中心的重新评估。

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型在复杂分布间的转换任务上表现不佳，而桥匹配方法虽然能处理数据分布间的转换，但未探索时间相关数据序列的应用，这对视频生成任务至关重要。

Method: TCVBM框架扩展桥匹配到时间相关视频序列，在扩散桥中显式建模序列间依赖关系，将时间相关性直接整合到采样过程中。

Result: 在帧插值、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率三个任务中，TCVBM在多个定量指标上表现优于基于桥匹配和扩散模型的传统方法。

Conclusion: TCVBM通过显式建模时间相关性，显著提升了视频生成任务中的生成质量和重建保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: PubSub-VFL通过创新的发布/订阅架构实现了高效的垂直联邦学习，理论分析证明其具有稳定收敛性且与差分隐私等安全协议兼容，有效解决了现有方法的效率和资源利用问题。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪生成模型在求解离散化反向时间SDE或ODE时，存在预定义噪声水平与采样中间状态实际噪声水平不匹配的问题，这种噪声偏移会导致次优生成结果。

Method: 提出噪声感知引导(NAG)方法，显式引导采样轨迹保持与预定义噪声调度的一致性；还引入了无分类器版本的NAG，通过噪声条件丢弃联合训练噪声条件和非条件模型。

Result: 在ImageNet生成和各种监督微调任务上的广泛实验表明，NAG能持续缓解噪声偏移问题，显著提升主流扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: 噪声偏移是扩散模型中普遍存在但被忽视的问题，NAG提供了一种简单有效的校正方法，能改善模型性能而无需外部分类器。

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

Abstract: The increasing popularity of portable ECG systems and the growing demand for
privacy-compliant, energy-efficient real-time analysis require new approaches
to signal processing at the point of data acquisition. In this context, the
edge domain is acquiring increasing importance, as it not only reduces latency
times, but also enables an increased level of data security. The FACE project
aims to develop an innovative machine learning solution for analysing long-term
electrocardiograms that synergistically combines the strengths of edge and
cloud computing. In this thesis, various pre-processing steps of ECG signals
are analysed with regard to their applicability in the project. The selection
of suitable methods in the edge area is based in particular on criteria such as
energy efficiency, processing capability and real-time capability.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

TL;DR: 知识蒸馏的功能性影响被量化分析，发现其更多作为数据依赖的正则化器而非压缩机制，存在显著的负向知识不对称转移风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解知识蒸馏作为压缩机制的功能性影响，解耦压缩与架构缩减，量化其知识转移能力。

Method: 使用假设检验、控制组和随机控制蒸馏，分析多种蒸馏变体和模型规模下的蒸馏缩放规律，涵盖12个实验设置、9种架构和7个数据集。

Result: 在某些模态和架构中存在统计显著的知识转移，但程度低于预期；显著知识转移时存在一致的严重负向知识不对称转移。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏主要作为数据依赖的正则化器而非压缩机制，具有负向不对称收益，在应用中存在安全隐患。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

Motivation: 高维动力学过程通常由低维流形上的少量有效变量描述，传统方法需要同时发现粗粒化变量和拟合控制方程，这导致训练不稳定。

Method: 利用预训练的FIMs零样本估计动力学系统的无穷小生成元，冻结FIM权重，仅训练编码器-解码器映射，定义简单且模拟一致的损失函数。

Conclusion: 该方法通过解耦表示学习和动力学推断，为动力学系统的粗粒化提供了更稳定和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出了元主动特征获取（meta-AFA）问题和Learning-to-Measure（L2M）方法，通过跨任务学习特征获取策略，在标签稀缺和高缺失率情况下优于任务特定基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统主动特征获取方法局限于单一任务、缺乏可扩展性的问题，以及实际应用中特征存在系统性缺失和标签有限的情况。

Method: L2M方法包含：1）对未见任务的可靠不确定性量化；2）基于不确定性的贪婪特征获取代理，最大化条件互信息。采用序列建模或自回归预训练方法处理任意缺失模式。

Result: 在合成和真实世界表格数据基准测试中，L2M匹配或超越任务特定基线方法，特别是在标签稀缺和高缺失率情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: L2M能够直接在具有回顾性缺失的数据集上运行，无需针对每个任务重新训练，实现了跨任务的元主动特征获取，提高了方法的可扩展性。

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem
where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively
selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from
retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited
task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single
predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we
formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies
across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of
i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an
uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional
mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive
pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for
tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with
retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,
eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular
benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly
under scarce labels and high missingness.

Motivation: 现有RL框架的可扩展性受限，因为RL轨迹生成中的极端长尾偏斜导致严重的GPU利用率不足。全局权重同步机制不适合RL训练中高度偏斜且不断演变的轨迹生成延迟分布，严重影响了训练效率。

Method: 提出Laminar系统：1）用中继工作者层替代全局更新，实现异步细粒度权重同步；2）动态重新打包机制将长尾轨迹整合到专用rollout上；3）完全解耦设计隔离故障确保鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过轨迹级异步和完全解耦架构，Laminar能够高效扩展RL后训练，显著提升训练效率和系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Bellman Wasserstein距离(BWD)，一种无需训练智能体就能评估离线强化学习数据集质量的方法，并通过实验验证了其与离线RL算法性能的强相关性，还能作为正则化器提升策略优化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习的数据集质量差异很大，但在实际应用中很难预先评估数据集质量，因为数据的来源和技能组成未知。需要一种无需训练智能体就能估计数据集质量的方法。

Method: 研究了从简单累积奖励到基于学习价值估计器的各种代理指标，并提出了Bellman Wasserstein距离(BWD)，这是一种基于价值感知的最优传输评分，通过行为评论家和状态条件最优传输公式计算，无需环境交互或完整策略优化。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务上，BWD与聚合多个离线RL算法的oracle性能评分强相关，能够有效预测标准智能体在给定数据集上的表现。将BWD作为正则化器还能提升策略优化的回报。

Conclusion: BWD等基于价值感知的分布信号是筛选离线RL数据集和策略优化的实用工具。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets,
without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets
vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random
trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity.
Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or
low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful
behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset
quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are
unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without
training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative
rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman
Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures
how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy.
BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT
formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.
Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance
score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient
prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond
prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization
explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves
returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such
as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy
optimization.

Conclusion: 这种方法使复杂的事件分析更加易于使用，并加速了科学发现的步伐。

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe dynamical systems evolving
deterministically in continuous time. Accurate data-driven modeling of systems
as ODEs, a central problem across the natural sciences, remains challenging,
especially if the data is sparse or noisy. We introduce FIM-ODE (Foundation
Inference Model for ODEs), a pretrained neural model designed to estimate ODEs
zero-shot (i.e., in context) from sparse and noisy observations. Trained on
synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE
inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE
provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and
qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.

Motivation: 现有的表格数据深度学习方法在处理噪声和有效利用目标信息方面存在不足，需要一种能够同时建模原始特征和目标条件表示、并能自适应过滤噪声的框架。

Method: 使用双流编码器分解特征为原始值流和目标条件流，通过交叉维度自注意力、交叉编码自注意力和自适应稀疏自注意力机制进行特征交互和噪声抑制。

Conclusion: SG-XDEAT通过双流表示学习和自适应噪声抑制机制，为表格数据学习提供了一个更鲁棒的深度学习方法。

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet
their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through
their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due
to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability
on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on
univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial
information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further
enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware
adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of
foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from
various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the
quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of
initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved
backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome
embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative
than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)
to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with
respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a
zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous
information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses
state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot
training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.
Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with
various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,
presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于城际客车异常停靠检测的稀疏感知方法，通过自适应分割、局部时间指标引导调整和图神经网络，在稀疏GPS数据和有限标注的情况下实现高精度检测。


<details>

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了GPS数据稀疏和标注有限的问题，为城际客车异常停靠检测提供了实用解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical
for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory
compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS
trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled
data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense
sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address
data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that
adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.
Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to
capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we
develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths
these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we
construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with
LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision
across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final
self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively
improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854
and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了化学预训练模型在药物发现中的多任务微调方法，发现多任务微调能显著提升模型性能，特别是在大数据量下效果更明显，并发布了多任务ADMET数据集和加速的KERMT模型实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学预训练模型在药物发现中具有重要应用价值，但如何有效利用这些模型来提升关键药物发现端点的预测性能（如靶点效力和ADMET性质）仍需深入研究。多任务学习已被证明能改善预测模型，因此研究多任务微调在化学预训练模型中的应用具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 多任务微调是提升化学预训练模型在药物发现中性能的有效策略，特别是在大数据场景下。通过发布多任务ADMET数据集和加速的KERMT实现，为工业药物发现工作流程提供了实用的工具和基准。

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.

TL;DR: CARVQ是一种结合校正适配器和分组残差向量量化的后训练压缩方法，可将LLM嵌入层压缩至约1.6比特，减少内存占用并加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的词嵌入层参数庞大，导致存储需求和内存占用过高，特别是在边缘设备上存在内存瓶颈，需要压缩嵌入层来释放内存带宽并加速推理。

Method: 使用校正适配器结合分组残差向量量化，通过线性和非线性映射的组合来模拟原始模型嵌入，无需专用硬件支持低位存储。

Result: 在多个预训练LLM上测试，CARVQ在大多数情况下能实现更低的平均比特数/参数，同时保持合理的困惑度和准确率，相比标量量化表现更好。

Conclusion: CARVQ是一种与最先进Transformer量化方法兼容的压缩技术，可无缝集成到支持4位内存的任何硬件中，为LLM在边缘设备上的高效部署迈出关键一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了决策树优化中两种局部搜索操作（调整切割阈值和交换特征）的最小化分类错误问题，证明了这些问题在一般情况下是NP完全的，但通过参数化复杂性分析找到了固定参数可解的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策树学习算法通常包含启发式局部搜索操作，但缺乏对这些操作的理论复杂性理解。研究旨在确定哪些问题特性导致计算困难，哪些特性使问题变得可解。

Method: 采用参数化复杂性分析方法，考虑特征数量d和域大小D等参数。当d和D都很小时，问题变得固定参数可解，并提出了时间复杂度为(D+1)^(2d)·|I|^O(1)的算法。

Result: 证明了问题在一般情况下是NP完全的，但当特征数量d和域大小D都很小时，问题变得固定参数可解。提供了概念验证实现并报告了实证结果。

Conclusion: 通过参数化复杂性分析，识别了决策树局部搜索操作问题的计算边界，为实际应用提供了理论指导，特别是在小特征集和小域大小的情况下可以实现高效求解。

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

Motivation: 解决农业环境中异构农场环境和隐私敏感数据的问题，需要在保护数据隐私的同时实现作物特定模型的训练和全局知识整合。

Method: 采用三层架构：客户端智能农场、作物特定聚合器和全局模型聚合器，引入季节性订阅机制，农场在每个农业季节开始时加入作物特定集群。

Conclusion: 分层联邦学习架构在农业应用中有效，既能实现作物特定专业化，又能跨作物整合知识，同时保护数据隐私并减少通信开销。

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

TL;DR: UNIVERSE方法通过使用Rashomon集合（接近最优的模型集合）来估计变量重要性，即使存在缺失特征也能提供真实变量重要性的边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变量重要性方法依赖于单一模型和观测到的特征，但变量重要性受其他变量影响很大，且重要变量经常在观测数据集中缺失。此外，不同模型可能给出不同的变量重要性估计（Rashomon效应）。

Method: 引入UNIVERSE方法，通过调整Rashomon集合（数据集中的近最优模型集合）来生成变量重要性的边界，即使存在缺失特征。

Result: 该方法在理论上保证了鲁棒性，在半合成模拟中表现出色，并在信用风险任务中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE方法能够有效处理变量重要性估计中的不确定性，特别是在存在缺失特征的情况下，提供更可靠的变量重要性边界估计。

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KoALA是一种无需语义信息、无需架构修改或对抗训练的新型对抗性检测器，通过KL散度和L0相似度两种互补指标的分类预测一致性来检测对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络极易受到对抗攻击的威胁，这对安全和关键应用构成重大风险，需要开发轻量级、即插即用的检测解决方案。

Method: 使用KL散度（对密集低幅度扰动敏感）和L0相似度（对稀疏高影响变化敏感）两种互补指标，当两种指标的分类预测不一致时检测对抗攻击。仅需在预训练图像编码器上使用干净图像进行简单微调。

Result: 在ResNet/CIFAR-10上达到0.94的精确度和0.81的召回率，在CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet上达到0.66的精确度和0.85的召回率。当定理条件满足时，能持续有效检测对抗样本。

Conclusion: KoALA提供了一种轻量级、即插即用的对抗检测解决方案，适用于现有模型和多种数据模态，无需架构修改或对抗训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which
pose significant risks to security- and safety-critical applications. We
present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,
semantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or
adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an
adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity
metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are
specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL
divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the
L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a
formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a
simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to
ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a
lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data
modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet
confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA
consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test
sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on
ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on
CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在构建适用于多决策者的预测器时存在样本复杂度不优或预测器过于复杂的问题，需要设计更高效的算法。

Method: 提出了两种改进方法：1）通过在线到批处理的转换获得样本高效但复杂的随机化预测器；2）利用适当损失函数的结构特性设计更直接的非随机化算法。

Result: 证明了多校准比全预测是更困难的问题，现有基于多校准的方法必然产生次优的样本复杂度。

Conclusion: 通过利用适当损失函数的结构特性，可以设计出比现有方法更直接、非随机化的高效预测算法。

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.

Motivation: 研究注意力风格非局部模型的基本统计效率，理解注意力机制及其训练的理论基础，特别是在权重矩阵和激活函数不可分离识别的情况下。

Method: 通过理论分析证明单层注意力风格模型中成对交互学习的最小收敛速率，其中token通过权重矩阵和非线性激活函数进行交互。

Result: 证明了最小收敛速率为M^{-2β/(2β+1)}，其中M为样本大小，该速率仅依赖于激活函数的平滑度β，而与token数量、环境维度或权重矩阵秩无关。

Conclusion: 注意力风格非局部模型具有基本维度无关的统计效率，这为理解注意力机制及其训练提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study the convergence rate of learning pairwise interactions in
single-layer attention-style models, where tokens interact through a weight
matrix and a non-linear activation function. We prove that the minimax rate is
$M^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta+1}}$ with $M$ being the sample size, depending only
on the smoothness $\beta$ of the activation, and crucially independent of token
count, ambient dimension, or rank of the weight matrix. These results highlight
a fundamental dimension-free statistical efficiency of attention-style nonlocal
models, even when the weight matrix and activation are not separately
identifiable and provide a theoretical understanding of the attention mechanism
and its training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化中的加性假设可以缓解高维复杂函数建模和搜索的困难，但常用的采集函数忽略了维度间的双边不确定性(BU)，这种近似在有限预算下的实际影响尚不清楚。

Method: 利用条件独立性，实现了考虑BU的Thompson采样，并进行了实证研究，比较了忽略BU的加性近似方法与精确方法的性能差异。

Result: 实证研究发现，忽略BU的加性Thompson采样近似方法确实比精确方法表现稍差，但这种差异在实际应用中并不显著。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持了理论理解，表明忽略BU的近似方法在贝叶斯优化实践中是足够的，即使在非渐近情况下也是如此。

Abstract: In Bayesian Optimization (BO), additive assumptions can mitigate the twin
difficulties of modeling and searching a complex function in high dimension.
However, common acquisition functions, like the Additive Lower Confidence
Bound, ignore pairwise covariances between dimensions, which we'll call
\textit{bilateral uncertainty} (BU), imposing a second layer of approximations.
While theoretical results indicate that asymptotically not much is lost in
doing so, little is known about the practical effects of this assumption in
small budgets. In this article, we show that by exploiting conditional
independence, Thompson Sampling respecting BU can be efficiently conducted. We
use this fact to execute an empirical investigation into the loss incurred by
ignoring BU, finding that the additive approximation to Thompson Sampling does
indeed have, on balance, worse performance than the exact method, but that this
difference is of little practical significance. This buttresses the theoretical
understanding and suggests that the BU-ignoring approximation is sufficient for
BO in practice, even in the non-asymptotic regime.

Abstract: We study statistical estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) when
users may hold heterogeneous privacy levels and accuracy must be guaranteed
with high probability. Departing from the common in-expectation analyses, and
for one-dimensional and multi-dimensional mean estimation problems, we develop
finite sample upper bounds in $\ell_2$-norm that hold with probability at least
$1-\beta$. We complement these results with matching minimax lower bounds,
establishing the optimality (up to constants) of our guarantees in the
heterogeneous LDP regime. We further study distribution learning in
$\ell_\infty$-distance, designing an algorithm with high-probability guarantees
under heterogeneous privacy demands. Our techniques offer principled guidance
for designing mechanisms in settings with user-specific privacy levels.

Abstract: We propose a new general framework for recovering low-rank structure in
optimal transport using Schatten-$p$ norm regularization. Our approach extends
existing methods that promote sparse and interpretable transport maps or plans,
while providing a unified and principled family of convex programs that
encourage low-dimensional structure. The convexity of our formulation enables
direct theoretical analysis: we derive optimality conditions and prove recovery
guarantees for low-rank couplings and barycentric maps in simplified settings.
To efficiently solve the proposed program, we develop a mirror descent
algorithm with convergence guarantees for $p \geq 1$. Experiments on synthetic
and real data demonstrate the method's efficiency, scalability, and ability to
recover low-rank transport structures.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its Ruppert-Polyak averaged variant
(ASGD) lie at the heart of modern large-scale learning, yet their theoretical
properties in high-dimensional settings are rarely understood. In this paper,
we provide rigorous statistical guarantees for constant learning-rate SGD and
ASGD in high-dimensional regimes. Our key innovation is to transfer powerful
tools from high-dimensional time series to online learning. Specifically, by
viewing SGD as a nonlinear autoregressive process and adapting existing
coupling techniques, we prove the geometric-moment contraction of
high-dimensional SGD for constant learning rates, thereby establishing
asymptotic stationarity of the iterates. Building on this, we derive the $q$-th
moment convergence of SGD and ASGD for any $q\ge2$ in general $\ell^s$-norms,
and, in particular, the $\ell^{\infty}$-norm that is frequently adopted in
high-dimensional sparse or structured models. Furthermore, we provide sharp
high-probability concentration analysis which entails the probabilistic bound
of high-dimensional ASGD. Beyond closing a critical gap in SGD theory, our
proposed framework offers a novel toolkit for analyzing a broad class of
high-dimensional learning algorithms.

Abstract: We study neural network compressibility by using singular learning theory to
extend the minimum description length (MDL) principle to singular models like
neural networks. Through extensive experiments on the Pythia suite with
quantization, factorization, and other compression techniques, we find that
complexity estimates based on the local learning coefficient (LLC) are closely,
and in some cases, linearly correlated with compressibility. Our results
provide a path toward rigorously evaluating the limits of model compression.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于FTPL框架和Pareto扰动的解耦多臂老虎机策略，实现了最佳两界性能：在随机环境中获得常数遗憾，在对抗环境中获得极小极大最优遗憾，且计算效率比现有方法快约20倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决解耦多臂老虎机问题中探索和利用的平衡，避免现有方法需要凸优化和重采样的计算瓶颈，同时实现随机和对抗环境下的最优性能。

Method: 在FTPL框架中使用Pareto扰动，无需凸优化和重采样步骤，同时处理探索臂和利用臂的选择。

Result: 在随机环境中实现常数遗憾，在对抗环境中达到极小极大最优遗憾，计算速度比Decoupled-Tsallis-INF快约20倍，且实证性能更优。

Conclusion: 提出的FTPL-Pareto策略在解耦多臂老虎机问题中实现了计算效率和性能的最佳平衡，证明了纯探索策略与标准利用策略的简单组合是次优的。

Abstract: We study the decoupled multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where the learner
selects one arm for exploration and one arm for exploitation in each round. The
loss of the explored arm is observed but not counted, while the loss of the
exploited arm is incurred without being observed. We propose a policy within
the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) framework using Pareto perturbations.
Our policy achieves (near-)optimal regret regardless of the environment, i.e.,
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW): constant regret in the stochastic regime, improving
upon the optimal bound of the standard MABs, and minimax optimal regret in the
adversarial regime. Moreover, the practicality of our policy stems from
avoiding both the convex optimization step required by the previous BOBW
policy, Decoupled-Tsallis-INF (Rouyer & Seldin, 2020), and the resampling step
that is typically necessary in FTPL. Consequently, it achieves substantial
computational improvement, about $20$ times faster than Decoupled-Tsallis-INF,
while also demonstrating better empirical performance in both regimes. Finally,
we empirically show that our approach outperforms a pure exploration policy,
and that naively combining a pure exploration with a standard exploitation
policy is suboptimal.

algorithm as a discretisation of these SDEs and provide theoretical guarantees
for the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the
empirical effectiveness of our method on synthetic and image datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we refine the Berry-Esseen bounds for the multivariate normal
approximation of Polyak-Ruppert averaged iterates arising from the linear
stochastic approximation (LSA) algorithm with decreasing step size. We consider
the normal approximation by the Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix
predicted by the Polyak-Juditsky central limit theorem and establish the rate
up to order $n^{-1/3}$ in convex distance, where $n$ is the number of samples
used in the algorithm. We also prove a non-asymptotic validity of the
multiplier bootstrap procedure for approximating the distribution of the
rescaled error of the averaged LSA estimator. We establish approximation rates
of order up to $1/\sqrt{n}$ for the latter distribution, which significantly
improves upon the previous results obtained by Samsonov et al. (2024).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索新闻情绪动态如何影响主权风险（以CDS利差衡量），并评估其相对于传统驱动因素（如全球货币政策和市场波动）的预测价值。

Method: 使用42个国家的高频日度面板数据，包括地缘政治风险、经济政策不确定性等新闻指标，采用赛马分析比较不同预测模型，特别应用非线性机器学习方法如随机森林。

Result: 研究发现新闻指标显著提升预测准确性，全球金融变量仍是主权风险主要驱动因素，但地缘政治风险和经济政策不确定性也发挥重要作用，且通过非线性交互效应被放大。

Conclusion: 结论是新闻情绪指标对主权风险预测具有重要价值，存在明显的区域异质性，某些资产类别和新兴市场对政策利率、全球金融波动和地缘政治风险冲击更为敏感。

Abstract: We introduce a novel high-frequency daily panel dataset of both markets and
news-based indicators -- including Geopolitical Risk, Economic Policy
Uncertainty, Trade Policy Uncertainty, and Political Sentiment -- for 42
countries across both emerging and developed markets. Using this dataset, we
study how sentiment dynamics shape sovereign risk, measured by Credit Default
Swap (CDS) spreads, and evaluate their forecasting value relative to
traditional drivers such as global monetary policy and market volatility. Our
horse-race analysis of forecasting models demonstrates that incorporating
news-based indicators significantly enhances predictive accuracy and enriches
the analysis, with non-linear machine learning methods -- particularly Random
Forests -- delivering the largest gains. Our analysis reveals that while global
financial variables remain the dominant drivers of sovereign risk, geopolitical
risk and economic policy uncertainty also play a meaningful role. Crucially,
their effects are amplified through non-linear interactions with global
financial conditions. Finally, we document pronounced regional heterogeneity,
as certain asset classes and emerging markets exhibit heightened sensitivity to
shocks in policy rates, global financial volatility, and geopolitical risk.

Result: 在标准基准测试中提高了最坏情况准确率，同时保持平均准确率的竞争力，发现了可解释的环境分布。

Conclusion: 使环境自适应是实现分布外泛化的实用途径。

Abstract: An open problem in Machine Learning is how to avoid models to exploit
spurious correlations in the data; a famous example is the background-label
shortcut in the Waterbirds dataset. A common remedy is to train a model across
multiple environments; in the Waterbirds dataset, this corresponds to training
by randomizing the background. However, selecting the right environments is a
challenging problem, given that these are rarely known a priori. We propose
Universal Adaptive Environment Discovery (UAED), a unified framework that
learns a distribution over data transformations that instantiate environments,
and optimizes any robust objective averaged over this learned distribution.
UAED yields adaptive variants of IRM, REx, GroupDRO, and CORAL without
predefined groups or manual environment design. We provide a theoretical
analysis by providing PAC-Bayes bounds and by showing robustness to test
environment distributions under standard conditions. Empirically, UAED
discovers interpretable environment distributions and improves worst-case
accuracy on standard benchmarks, while remaining competitive on mean accuracy.
Our results indicate that making environments adaptive is a practical route to
out-of-distribution generalization.

Abstract: We introduce a general framework for constructing generative models using
one-dimensional noising processes. Beyond diffusion processes, we outline
examples that demonstrate the flexibility of our approach. Motivated by this,
we propose a novel framework in which the 1D processes themselves are
learnable, achieved by parameterizing the noise distribution through quantile
functions that adapt to the data. Our construction integrates seamlessly with
standard objectives, including Flow Matching and consistency models. Learning
quantile-based noise naturally captures heavy tails and compact supports when
present. Numerical experiments highlight both the flexibility and the
effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: Sinkhorn流具有丰富的数学结构，可视为可逆Markov动力学和Onsager梯度流，其谱性质和熵衰减特性为算法设计和分析提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: Recently, the vanishing-step-size limit of the Sinkhorn algorithm at finite
regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ was shown to be a mirror descent in the
space of probability measures. We give $L^2$ contraction criteria in two
time-dependent metrics induced by the mirror Hessian, which reduce to the
coercivity of certain conditional expectation operators. We then give an exact
identity for the entropy production rate of the Sinkhorn flow, which was
previously known only to be nonpositive. Examining this rate shows that the
standard semigroup analysis of diffusion processes extends systematically to
the Sinkhorn flow. We show that the flow induces a reversible Markov dynamics
on the target marginal as an Onsager gradient flow. We define the Dirichlet
form associated to its (nonlocal) infinitesimal generator, prove a Poincar\'e
inequality for it, and show that the spectral gap is strictly positive along
the Sinkhorn flow whenever $\varepsilon > 0$. Lastly, we show that the entropy
decay is exponential if and only if a logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI)
holds. We give for illustration two immediate practical use-cases for the
Sinkhorn LSI: as a design principle for the latent space in which generative
models are trained, and as a stopping heuristic for discrete-time algorithms.

Abstract: We develop a unified statistical framework for softmax-gated Gaussian mixture
of experts (SGMoE) that addresses three long-standing obstacles in parameter
estimation and model selection: (i) non-identifiability of gating parameters up
to common translations, (ii) intrinsic gate-expert interactions that induce
coupled differential relations in the likelihood, and (iii) the tight
numerator-denominator coupling in the softmax-induced conditional density. Our
approach introduces Voronoi-type loss functions aligned with the gate-partition
geometry and establishes finite-sample convergence rates for the maximum
likelihood estimator (MLE). In over-specified models, we reveal a link between
the MLE's convergence rate and the solvability of an associated system of
polynomial equations characterizing near-nonidentifiable directions. For model
selection, we adapt dendrograms of mixing measures to SGMoE, yielding a
consistent, sweep-free selector of the number of experts that attains
pointwise-optimal parameter rates under overfitting while avoiding multi-size
training. Simulations on synthetic data corroborate the theory, accurately
recovering the expert count and achieving the predicted rates for parameter
estimation while closely approximating the regression function. Under model
misspecification (e.g., $\epsilon$-contamination), the dendrogram selection
criterion is robust, recovering the true number of mixture components, while
the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, and the
integrated completed likelihood tend to overselect as sample size grows. On a
maize proteomics dataset of drought-responsive traits, our dendrogram-guided
SGMoE selects two experts, exposes a clear mixing-measure hierarchy, stabilizes
the likelihood early, and yields interpretable genotype-phenotype maps,
outperforming standard criteria without multi-size training.
