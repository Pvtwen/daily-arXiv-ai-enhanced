Previous studies using the UCI Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset\nreported promising drift compensation results but lacked robust statistical\nexperimental validation and may overcompensate for sensor drift, losing\nclass-related variance.To address these limitations and improve sensor drift\ncompensation with statistical rigor, we first designed two domain adaptation\ntasks based on the same electronic nose dataset: using the first batch to\npredict the remaining batches, simulating a controlled laboratory setting; and\npredicting the next batch using all prior batches, simulating continuous\ntraining data updates for online training. We then systematically tested three\nmethods: our proposed novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) method, the benchmark\nmethod Domain Regularized Component Analysis (DRCA), and a hybrid method\nKD-DRCA, across 30 random test set partitions on the UCI dataset.

A central server seeks to estimate the complete covariance matrix using\na limited number of bits communicated by each agent. We obtain a nearly tight\nminimax lower bound for covariance matrix estimation under operator norm and\nFrobenius norm.

Yet despite the appealing simplicity of the C2ST, its\ntheoretical and practical reliability depend upon having access to a\nnear-Bayes-optimal classifier -- a requirement that is rarely met and, at best,\ndifficult to verify.

To tackle this\nproblem, it is promising to incorporate the underutilized unlicensed spectrum\nwith the licensed spectrum to boost network capacity. However, the openness of\nunlicensed spectrum makes UAVs susceptible to security threats from potential\njammers. Therefore, a spectrum sharing UAV network coexisting with licensed\ncellular network and unlicensed Wi-Fi network is considered with the\nanti-jamming technique in this paper. The sum rate maximization of the\nsecondary network is studied by jointly optimizing the transmit power,\nsubchannel allocation, and UAV trajectory.

A Principled Framework to Use Data Bias for OOD Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "Most existing methods for adapting models to out-of-distribution (OOD)\ndomains rely on invariant representation learning to eliminate the influence of\nbiased features. However, should bias always be eliminated -- and if not, when\nshould it be retained, and how can it be leveraged? To address these questions,\nwe first present a theoretical analysis that explores the conditions under\nwhich biased features can be identified and effectively utilized. Building on\nthis theoretical foundation, we introduce a novel framework that strategically\nleverages bias to complement invariant representations during inference. The\nframework comprises two key components that leverage bias in both direct and\nindirect ways: (1) using invariance as guidance to extract predictive\ningredients from bias, and (2) exploiting identified bias to estimate the\nenvironmental condition and then use it to explore appropriate bias-aware\npredictors to alleviate environment gaps.

This\npaper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor\nwithin a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish\nkey theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under\nperfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources\ngrows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected\noutput conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast,\nwhen only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall\nexpected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated\npredictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to\nachieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability\nrequirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot\nimprove the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new\ninformation about future channel states. Additionally, we show that\nwell-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that\nnecessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition\nthat the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to\noccur.

We call this phenomenon RL-induced\nparameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity\nconstraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL\nalgorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI,\nMeta, and open-source LLMs).

To mitigate these limitations, existing\napproaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to\nalleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both\nchallenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a\ncomplex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed\nsynchronization steps), and model convergence rate.

However,\nexisting matrix CB methods fail to explore such graph information, and thereby\nmaking them difficult to generate effective decision-making policies. To fill\nin this void, we propose in this paper a novel matrix CB algorithmic framework\nthat builds upon the classical upper confidence bound (UCB) framework. This new\nframework can effectively integrate both the low-rank structure and graph\ninformation in a unified manner. Specifically, it involves first solving a\njoint nuclear norm and matrix Laplacian regularization problem, followed by the\nimplementation of a graph-based generalized linear version of the UCB\nalgorithm.

In this paper, we explore a\nmore challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two\nintertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs\nthe detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which\ndestabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems,\na novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding\ngeneration to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust\ndetection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional\nvariational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old\nclasses, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nlanguage-based, netlist-aware neural network designed explicitly for standard\ncells. Our approach employs two pre-trained neural models of waveform\nprediction and delay estimation that directly infer transient waveforms and\npropagation delays from SPICE netlists, conditioned on critical physical\nparameters such as load capacitance, input slew, and gate size. This method\naccurately captures both intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects without\nrequiring simplification or interpolation. For multi-stage timing prediction,\nwe implement a recursive propagation strategy where predicted waveforms from\neach stage feed into subsequent stages, cumulatively capturing delays across\nthe logic chain. This approach ensures precise timing alignment and complete\nwaveform visibility throughout complex signal pathways. The waveform prediction\nutilizes a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with netlist-aware node-level\nencoding, addressing traditional Transformers' fixed input dimensionality\nconstraints. Additionally, specialized subnetworks separately handle primary\ndelay estimation and crosstalk correction. Experimental results demonstrate\nSPICE-level accuracy, consistently achieving RMSE below 0.0098 across diverse\nindustrial circuits. The proposed framework provides a scalable, structurally\nadaptable neural alternative to conventional power and timing engines,\ndemonstrating high fidelity to physical circuit behaviors."}

This\npaper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor\nwithin a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish\nkey theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under\nperfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources\ngrows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected\noutput conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast,\nwhen only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall\nexpected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated\npredictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to\nachieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability\nrequirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot\nimprove the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new\ninformation about future channel states. Additionally, we show that\nwell-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that\nnecessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition\nthat the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to\noccur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous\nsimulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt\nscaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is\ntrained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system.\nFurthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with\ntemporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver\nmobility."}

Building on a previous single-target\nalgorithm based on Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP), we extend\nit to the multi-target case by assigning each target an independent POMCP tree,\nenabling scalable and efficient planning.\n  Departing from uniform power allocation-which is often suboptimal with\nvarying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)-our approach predicts each target's\nfuture angular position and expected received power, based on its estimated\nrange and radar cross-section (RCS). These predictions guide adaptive waveform\ndesign via a constrained optimization problem that allocates transmit energy to\nenhance the detectability of weaker or distant targets, while ensuring\nsufficient power for high-SNR targets. The reward function in the underlying\npartially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is also modified to\nprioritize accurate spatial and power estimation.\n  Simulations involving multiple targets with different SNRs confirm the\neffectiveness of our method.

Our method achieves minimax-optimal excess risk for both\nthe squared loss and Lipschitz-smooth convex loss functions under a local\nstrong convexity condition.

To alleviate this problem, especially in studies based\non observational data with uncontrolled dynamic treatment and real-time\nmeasurement of many covariates, we propose abandoning the baseline hazard and\nusing machine learning to explicitly model the change in the risk set with or\nwithout latent variables. For this framework, we clarify the context in which\nhazard ratios can be causally interpreted, and then develop a method based on\nNeyman orthogonality to compute debiased maximum-likelihood estimators of\nhazard ratios. Computing the constructed estimators is more efficient than\ncomputing those based on weighted regression with marginal structural Cox\nmodels.

Particularly, Darcy flow equation is a fundamental\nequation in fluid mechanics, which plays a crucial role in understanding fluid\nflow through porous media. Bayesian methods provide an effective approach for\nsolving PDEs inverse problems, while their numerical implementation requires\nnumerous evaluations of computationally expensive forward solvers. Therefore,\nthe adoption of surrogate models with lower computational costs is essential.\nHowever, constructing a globally accurate surrogate model for high-dimensional\ncomplex problems demands high model capacity and large amounts of data. To\naddress this challenge, this study proposes an efficient locally accurate\nsurrogate that focuses on the high-probability regions of the true likelihood\nin inverse problems, with relatively low model complexity and few training data\nrequirements. Additionally, we introduce a sequential Bayesian design strategy\nto acquire the proposed surrogate since the high-probability region of the\nlikelihood is unknown. The strategy treats the posterior evolution process of\nsequential Bayesian design as a Gaussian process, enabling algorithmic\nacceleration through one-step ahead prior.
