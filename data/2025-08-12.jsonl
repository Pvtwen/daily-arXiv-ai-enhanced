Most existing federated\nlearning methods focus on the ``static\" datasets. However, in many real-world\napplications, data arrive continuously over time, forming streaming datasets.\nThis introduces additional challenges for data storage and algorithm design,\nparticularly under high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose a\nfederated online learning (FOL) method for distributed multi-source streaming\ndata analysis. To account for heterogeneity, a personalized model is\nconstructed for each data source, and a novel ``subgroup\" assumption is\nemployed to capture potential similarities, thereby enhancing model\nperformance. We adopt the penalized renewable estimation method and the\nefficient proximal gradient descent for model training. The proposed method\naligns with both federated and online learning frameworks: raw data are not\nexchanged among sources, ensuring data privacy, and only summary statistics of\nprevious data batches are required for model updates, significantly reducing\nstorage demands. Theoretically, we establish the consistency properties for\nmodel estimation, variable selection, and subgroup structure recovery,\ndemonstrating optimal statistical efficiency.

For the continuous position case, we propose a two-layer\niterative optimization method based on differential evolution with one-in-one\nrepresentation (DEO), to find a high-quality solution with relatively moderate\ncomputational complexity. For the discrete position case, we first extend the\nDEO based iterative framework by introducing the mapping and determination\noperations to handle the characteristic of discrete MA positions. To further\nreduce the computational complexity, we then design an alternating optimization\n(AO) iterative framework to solve all variables within a single layer. In\nparticular, we develop an efficient strategy to derive the sub-optimal solution\nfor the discrete MA positions, superseding the DEO-based method. Numerical\nresults validate the effectiveness of the proposed MA empowered secure\ntransmission scheme along with its optimization algorithms."}

The received symbols are more difficult to\nequalize since they are subject to interference along both delay and Doppler\naxes. In this paper, we propose a new low-complexity method of equalizing\nZak-OTFS in the frequency domain (FD). We derive the FD system model and show\nthat it is unitarily equivalent to the DD system model. We show that the\nchannel matrix in the FD is banded, making it possible to apply conjugate\ngradient methods to reduce the complexity of equalization. We show that\ncomplexity of FD equalization is linear in the dimension of a Zak-OTFS frame.\nFor comparison the complexity of naive MMSE equalization is cubic in the frame\ndimension. Through numerical simulations we show that FD equalization of\nZak-OTFS achieves similar performance as equalization in DD domain."}

We compare OTAKNet\nagainst classical model-based adaptive Kalman filtering and offline\nlearning-based filtering. The performance is demonstrated on both synthetic and\nreal-world NCLT datasets, particularly under limited training data."}

In\nthis paper, we tackle this challenge from a data-centric perspective.

Instead of using this term for direct optimization, we leverage it\nto formulate a novel, theoretically-grounded data selection principle. Our\nprinciple advocates for selecting a subset of high-consensus data-identified by\nthe most negative PD values-for efficient DPO training. We prove the optimality\nof this strategy by analyzing the loss bounds of the DMPO objective in the\nselection problem. To operationalize our approach, we introduce practical\nmethods of PD term estimation and length bias mitigation, thereby proposing our\nPD selection method.

PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is\nthe number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within\nmilliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto\nstationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least\none other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B\nparameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning\nwith its theoretical advantages. PAMA provides a highly efficient solution to\nthe MOA problem that was previously considered intractable, offering a\npractical and theoretically grounded approach to aligning LLMs with diverse\nhuman values, paving the way for versatile and adaptable real-world AI\ndeployments."}

Among these, Doubly Robust methods provide a\nprominent strategy to combine value- and policy-based estimators.\n  In this work, we take an alternative perspective to combine a set of OPE\nestimators and their associated confidence intervals into a single, more\naccurate estimate. Our approach leverages a correlated fixed-effects\nmeta-analysis framework, explicitly accounting for dependencies among\nestimators that arise due to shared data. This yields a best linear unbiased\nestimate (BLUE) of the target policy's value, along with an appropriately\nconservative confidence interval that reflects inter-estimator correlation. We\nvalidate our method on both simulated and real-world data, demonstrating\nimproved statistical efficiency over existing individual estimators."}

Focusing on both\nthe last iterate and Polyak-Ruppert averaging regimes, we derive bounds for\nnormal approximation in terms of the convex distance between probability\ndistributions. Our analysis reveals a non-trivial interaction between the fast\nand slow timescales: the normal approximation rate for the last iterate\nimproves as the timescale separation increases, while it decreases in the\nPolyak-Ruppert averaged setting. We also provide the high-order moment bounds\nfor the error of linear TTSA algorithm, which may be of independent interest."}

Our test builds on\nrecent results showing how such combined embeddings map distinct probability\nmeasures to mutually singular Gaussian measures on the kernel's RKHS.\nLeveraging this result, we construct a test statistic based on the relative\nentropy between the Gaussian embeddings, i.e.\\ the likelihood ratio. The\nlikelihood ratio is specifically tailored to detect equality versus singularity\nof two Gaussians, and satisfies a ``$0/\\infty$\" law, in that it vanishes under\nthe null and diverges under the alternative. To implement the test in finite\nsamples, we introduce a regularised version, calibrated by way of permutation.\nWe prove consistency, establish uniform power guarantees under mild conditions,\nand discuss how our framework unifies and extends prior approaches based on\nspectrally regularized MMD. Empirical results on synthetic and real data\ndemonstrate remarkable gains in power compared to state-of-the-art methods,\nparticularly in high-dimensional and weak-signal regimes."}

The sensing stage\nperforms logit-domain Bayesian updates with trimmed aggregation and\nattention-weighted consensus, and the base station (BS) fuses network beliefs\nwith a conservative minimum rule, preserving detection accuracy under a bounded\nnumber of Byzantine users. Conditioned on the sensing outcome, we pose downlink\ndesign as sum mean-squared error (MSE) minimization under transmit-power and\nsignal-leakage constraints and jointly optimize the BS precoder, IRS phase\nshifts, and user equalizers. With partial (or known) CSI, we develop an\naugmented-Lagrangian alternating algorithm with projected updates and provide\nprovable sublinear convergence, with accelerated rates under mild local\ncurvature. With unknown CSI, we perform constrained Bayesian optimization (BO)\nin a geometry-aware low-dimensional latent space using Gaussian process (GP)\nsurrogates; we prove regret bounds for a constrained upper confidence bound\n(UCB) variant of the BO module, and demonstrate strong empirical performance of\nthe implemented procedure. Simulations across diverse network conditions show\nhigher detection probability at fixed false-alarm rate under adversarial\nattacks, large reductions in sum MSE for honest users, strong suppression of\neavesdropper signal power, and fast convergence. The framework offers a\npractical path to secure opportunistic communication that adapts to CSI\navailability while coherently coordinating sensing and transmission through\njoint learning."}
