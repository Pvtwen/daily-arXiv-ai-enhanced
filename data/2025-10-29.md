### [1] [Nonlinear Stacked Intelligent Surfaces for Wireless Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23780)
*Omran Abbas,Abdullah Zayat,Loıc Markley,Anas Chaaban*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出非线性堆叠智能表面(SIS)，能够模拟神经网络行为，相比传统线性SIS在MIMO系统中显著降低符号错误率，提高通信可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SIS仅能实现线性操作，限制了其应用潜力。为了解锁SIS的更多可能性，需要开发能够执行非线性操作的SIS。

Result: 非线性SIS通过形成复杂的信号模式，提供更高的抗噪声干扰多样性，相比线性SIS显著提高了通信可靠性。

Conclusion: 非线性SIS是下一代无线系统的有前景技术，能够实现更复杂的信号处理功能，在多种无线通信场景中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS) are a promising technology for
next-generation wireless systems, offering an opportunity to enhance
communication performance with low power consumption. Typically, an SIS is
modelled as a surface that imparts phase shifts on impinging electromagnetic
signals to achieve desired communication objectives. However, this mode of
operation results in a linear SIS, which limits its applicability to linear
operations. To unlock further SIS potential, we propose a nonlinear SIS that
can mimic the behaviour of nonlinear neural networks. We discuss the
feasibility and potential of this idea and propose a nonlinear SIS unit cell
with a step-like response. To evaluate the system-level performance of
nonlinear SIS, we present a case study where SIS structures are optimized to
minimize the symbol error rate (SER) in an MIMO system with SIS deployed at
both the transmitter and receiver sides using only statistical channel
information. We demonstrate that a nonlinear SIS can improve communication
reliability compared to a linear SIS by forming complex signal patterns across
the SIS surface, which provide higher diversity against noise disturbances,
while still allowing the receiver to discern these patterns. Finally, we
outline several potential applications of nonlinear SIS in wireless
communication scenarios.

### [2] [Communication in a Fractional World: MIMO MC-OTFS Precoder Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23832)
*Evan Allen,Karim Said,Robert Calderbank,Lingjia Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物理信息的复杂指数基扩展模型预测框架，用于解决高移动性MIMO通信中CSI反馈的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G技术发展，高移动性场景如MANETs、VANETs和FANETs需要支持MIMO技术，但传统时频CSI反馈方案在快速变化的信道条件下负担过重，因此需要转向更稳定的延迟-多普勒表示方法。

Method: 推导了OTFS I/O关系随时间变化的表达式，并基于此创建了物理信息复杂指数基扩展模型预测框架，最大化过时CSI的有效性。

Result: 该框架能够处理整数和分数延迟-多普勒信道，促进高移动性MIMO通信。

Conclusion: 提出的预测框架为高移动性环境下的MIMO通信提供了有效的CSI反馈解决方案。

Abstract: As 6G technologies advance, international bodies and regulatory agencies are
intensifying efforts to extend seamless connectivity especially for
high-mobility scenarios such as Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{MANETs}) types
such as Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{VANETs}) and Flying Ad-Hoc Networks
(\textit{FANETs}). For these environments to be considered for long term
adoption and use they must support Multiple-Input-Multiple- (MIMO) technology,
rapidly fluctuating channel conditions in these environments place a heavy
burden on traditional time-frequency CSI feedback schemes required for MIMO
precoding. This motivates a shift toward delay-Doppler representations like
those employed by Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space(OTFS) modulation, which
offers greater stability under mobility. We derive an expression for the
variation over time in the OTFS I/O relationship. We then use this to create a
physics informed complex exponential basis expansion model prediction framework
that maximizes the usefulness of outdated Channel State Information (CSI) in
the presence of integer and fractional delay-Doppler channels and facilitates
high mobility MIMO communication.

### [3] [Coordinated Multipoint Transmission in Pinching Antenna Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23837)
*Ali Amhaz,Shreya Khisa,Mohamed Elhattab,Chadi Assi,Sanaa Sharafeddine*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了一种采用捏合天线系统的协调多点传输方案，通过联合优化波束成形向量和捏合位置来最大化系统可达和速率，解决了传统CoMP系统的速率上限问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CoMP系统采用均匀线性阵列时存在速率上限限制，而捏合天线技术能够克服MIMO系统中的大尺度衰落问题，因此需要研究如何将该技术优势应用到CoMP系统中。

Method: 采用基于梯度的元学习策略来解决联合优化传输波束成形向量和波导上捏合位置的非凸优化问题，该问题由于决策参数间的强耦合而难以用传统优化方法解决。

Result: 数值分析表明所提出的GML方法达到了最优解的92%，相比其他基准方法具有优越性，并且相比传统CoMP系统实现了更高的可达速率上限。

Conclusion: 基于梯度的元学习方法能够有效解决CoMP系统中捏合天线技术的联合优化问题，显著提升了系统性能，为克服传统CoMP系统的速率限制提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We study a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission where two base
stations (BSs), each supported by a pinching antenna system (PASS), are
deployed to jointly serve communication users under spatial division multiple
access (SDMA) technology. Pinching Antenna technology was introduced as a
promising solution to overcome the large-scale fading that has been shown to be
an impediment in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To realize the
advantages of this technology in CoMP systems, which suffer from an upperbound
rate limitation when traditional uniform linear arrays (ULAs) are adopted, we
formulate an optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the achievable sum
rate by jointly determining the transmit beamforming vectors and pinching
locations on the waveguides while respecting the quality of service (QoS)
requirements of users. This problem is inherently non-convex due to the strong
coupling among its decision parameters, making it challenging to solve using
traditional optimization methods. Thus, we utilize a gradient-based
meta-learning (GML) strategy specifically designed for large-scale optimization
tasks. Finally, numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the
proposed GML approach, achieving 92 percent of the optimal solution, and the
superiority of the solution presented compared to other benchmarks. In
addition, it achieves a higher upper bound on the achievable rate compared to
conventional CoMP systems.

### [4] [Accurate Prediction of Nonlinear Distortion of Multi-Carrier Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23844)
*Cameron M. Pike,Brad Oney,Gabriel Hepner,Animesh Yadav*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 使用特征函数级数法预测稀疏多载波传输中的非线性失真频谱，该方法计算效率高，可通过FFT和数值自卷积实现，并在理论和实验上得到验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 功率放大器中的非线性会严重影响多载波调制技术，需要准确预测非线性失真以在设计输出功率和网络吞吐量之间进行权衡。

Method: 采用特征函数级数法，将非线性表示为S21参数或跨导函数的FFT，失真分量表示为干净频谱的数值自卷积。

Result: 理论验证表明该方法与经典Price定理结果一致；实验验证显示预测输出频谱与实验室测量结果相符，可轻松计算信噪比等参数。

Conclusion: 特征函数级数法能有效预测非线性失真，计算效率高，适用于稀疏多载波传输系统设计。

Abstract: Nonlinearities in power amplifiers adversely affect multi-carrier modulation
techniques. Accurate prediction of nonlinear distortion is essential for making
design trade-offs between output power and network throughput. We use the
series form of the characteristic function (ch.f.) method to predict distortion
spectra for sparse multi-carrier transmissions. This method results in
efficient calculations of individual signal and distortion components. The
method is validated both theoretically and practically. Theoretical validation
is performed by modeling the signal as a bandpass Gaussian process that is hard
limited, and it is shown that the series ch.f. method produces results that are
identical with the classical Price's theorem. Practical validation is shown by
considering an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with a
fragmented spectrum which is then applied to an amplifier driven into
compression for which application of Price's theorem is difficult, and the
predicted output spectrum corroborates laboratory measurements. Part of the
computational efficiency is realized in that the nonlinearity can be expressed
as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of samples of its forward scattering
parameter (i.e., S21) or transconductance function (including AM-PM effects),
and distortion contributions of the signal can be expressed as numerical
autoconvolutions of the clean spectrum. Signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) can be
easily computed and parameterized across variables of interest, such as
overdrive level.

### [5] [Learning-based Spectral Regression for Cocoa Bean Physicochemical Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23892)

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可可豆质量评估方法耗时、破坏性且难以扩展，需要快速、可靠、非侵入性的替代方案。

Conclusion: 这种非破坏性方法为整个可可生产链的质量评估提供了适合且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Cocoa bean quality assessment is essential for ensuring compliance with
commercial standards, protecting consumer health, and increasing the market
value of the cocoa product. The quality assessment estimates key
physicochemical properties, such as fermentation level, moisture content,
polyphenol concentration, and cadmium content, among others. This assessment
has traditionally relied on the accurate estimation of these properties via
visual or sensory evaluation, jointly with laboratory-based physicochemical
analyses, which are often time-consuming, destructive, and difficult to scale.
This creates the need for rapid, reliable, and noninvasive alternatives.
Spectroscopy, particularly in the visible and near-infrared ranges, offers a
non-invasive alternative by capturing the molecular signatures associated with
these properties. Therefore, this work introduces a scalable methodology for
evaluating the quality of cocoa beans by predicting key physicochemical
properties from the spectral signatures of cocoa beans. This approach utilizes
a conveyor belt system integrated with a VIS-NIR spectrometer, coupled with
learning-based regression models. Furthermore, a dataset is built using cocoa
bean batches from Santander, Colombia. Ground-truth reference values were
obtained through standardized laboratory analyses and following commercial
cocoa quality regulations. To further evaluate the proposed methodology's
generalization, performance is tested on samples collected from other Colombian
regions and from Cusco, Peru. Experimental results show that the proposed
models achieved R2 scores exceeding 0.98 across all physicochemical properties,
and reached 0.96 accuracy on geographically independent samples. This
non-destructive approach represents a suitable and scalable alternative to
conventional laboratory methods for quality assessment across the cocoa
production chain.

Result: 开发出了一个能够准确表征NLOS链路PSD的几何感知信道模型。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种从基本原理推导PSD的方法，不仅能够复现现有结果，还能解释PSD特征与传播几何之间的因果关系，填补了相关技术空白。

Abstract: This paper presents a new derivation of LEO-to-ground receiver channel model
to address a clear gap in the prior art: the lack of an appropriate geometry
aware characterization of non LOS (NLOS) link model represented by the power
spectral density (PSD). Specifically, the main contribution is a coherent
derivation of the PSD from 1st principles that is able to reproduce results in
prior art and explain the causal relationship of main PSD features to the
propagation geometry parameters.

### [7] [Inferring Group Intent as a Cooperative Game. An NLP-based Framework for Trajectory Analysis using Graph Transformer Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23905)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文将群体目标轨迹意图建模为合作博弈的结果，使用基于自然语言处理的生成模型来模拟复杂时空轨迹，并通过博弈论概念（核心、沙普利值、核仁）来分配玩家收益，从而生成反映群体意图的协调时空轨迹分布。


<details>

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将合作博弈理论与生成模型相结合，为群体目标轨迹意图的建模和推理提供了有效的解决方案，实现了从观测数据到群体意图的端到端推理。

Abstract: This paper studies group target trajectory intent as the outcome of a
cooperative game where the complex-spatio trajectories are modeled using an
NLP-based generative model. In our framework, the group intent is specified by
the characteristic function of a cooperative game, and allocations for players
in the cooperative game are specified by either the core, the Shapley value, or
the nucleolus. The resulting allocations induce probability distributions that
govern the coordinated spatio-temporal trajectories of the targets that reflect
the group's underlying intent. We address two key questions: (1) How can the
intent of a group trajectory be optimally formalized as the characteristic
function of a cooperative game? (2) How can such intent be inferred from noisy
observations of the targets? To answer the first question, we introduce a
Fisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which
yields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal
patterns. As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based
generative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic
multi-target trajectory data. To answer the second question, we train a Graph
Transformer Neural Network (GTNN) to infer group trajectory intent-expressed as
the characteristic function of the cooperative game-from observational data
with high accuracy. The self-attention function of the GTNN depends on the
track estimates. Thus, the formulation and algorithms provide a multi-layer
approach that spans target tracking (Bayesian signal processing) and the GTNN
(for group intent inference).

### [8] [Machine Learning-Driven User Localization in RIS-Assisted Wireless Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23908)
*M. T. Hassan,D. Zelenchuk,M. A. B. Abbasi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的用户定位框架，用于RIS辅助的6G毫米波通信，通过测量四个角扇区的接收信号功率来预测用户角度位置，减少波束搜索开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G需要超可靠低延迟的毫米波通信，但RIS扩展了波束搜索空间，传统穷举扫描效率低下。需要智能方法减少控制开销和延迟。

Method: 使用20x20 RIS在27GHz频段反射信号，将0-90度仰角平面分为四个扇区。收集用户位置和接收功率数据，训练多种回归模型（DT、SVR、KNN、XGBoost等）。

Result: 决策树模型表现最佳，MAE为4.8度，R²=0.96。其他模型准确率70-86%。预测辐射模式与真实值高度吻合，主瓣对齐在52-55度之间。

Conclusion: 该框架显著减少波束探测次数，实现更快对齐，降低RIS辅助6G网络的延迟。

Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) targets ultra reliable, low latency (URLLC) gigabit
connectivity in mmWave bands, where directional channels require precise beam
alignment. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) reshape wave propagation
and extend coverage, but they enlarge the beam search space at the base
station, making exhaustive sweeps inefficient due to control overhead and
latency. We propose an ML based user localization framework for RIS assisted
communication at 27 GHz. A 20x20 RIS reflects signals from a core network
connected base station and sweeps beams across the 0-90 degree elevation plane,
divided into four angular sectors. We build a dataset by recording received
signal power (Pr in dBm) across user locations and train multiple regressors,
including decision tree (DT), support vector regressor (SVR), k nearest
neighbor (KNN), XGBoost, gradient boosting, and random forest. In operation, an
unknown user in the same plane measures four received power values (one per
sector) and reports them to the pretrained RIS controller, which predicts the
user's angular position in real time. Evaluation using mean absolute error
(MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R squared (R2) shows high accuracy.
The DT model achieves an MAE of 4.8 degrees with R2 = 0.96, while other models
reach 70 to 86 percent. Predicted radiation patterns, including main lobe
alignment between 52 and 55 degrees, closely track ground truth. The framework
reduces beam probing, enables faster alignment, and lowers latency for RIS
assisted 6G networks.

### [9] [Localized Acoustic-Event Measurement Probe: Connector Confirmation Utilizing Acoustic Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24017)
*Brian Skoglind,Travis Roberts,Sourabh Karmakar,Cameron Turner,Laine Mears*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于声学检测的电气连接状态验证系统，通过物理降噪和声音特征放大算法提高信噪比，能够有效检测电气连接器的正确连接状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电子产品中大量电气连接仍依赖人工完成，容易因连接力不均或人为疲劳导致连接不良，传统检测方法（视觉验证、增强现实、电路参数测量）在检测连接状态方面能力有限。

Method: 采用物理系统进行背景噪声抑制，并结合成功配对噪声特征放大算法来提高电气连接器配对声音与工厂环境声音之间的信噪比。

Result: 该解决方案在检测和分类连接状态方面有效性超过75%，且无需对现有手动互连流程进行任何修改。

Conclusion: 声学验证系统为电气连接确认提供了一种有效的替代方案，通过信噪比提升技术解决了工厂环境中声音检测的挑战。

Abstract: Modern consumer products are full of interconnected electrical and electronic
modules to fulfill direct and indirect needs. In an automated assembly line
still, most of these interconnections are required to be done manually due to
the large variety of connector types, connector positions, and the soft,
flexible nature of their structures. The manual connection points are the
source of partial or completely loose connections. Sometimes connections are
missed due to the application of unequal mating forces and natural human
fatigue. Subsequently, these defects can lead to unexpected downtime and
expensive rework. For successful connection detection, past approaches such as
vision verification, Augmented Reality, or circuit parameter-based measurements
have shown limited ability to detect the correct connection state. Though most
connections emit a specific noise for successful mating, the acoustic-based
verification system for electrical connection confirmation has not been
extensively researched. The main discouraging reason for such research is the
typically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between the sound of a pair of
electrical connector mating and the diverse soundscape of the plant. In this
study, the authors investigated increasing the SNR between the electrical
connector mating sound and the plant soundscape to improve connection success
detection by employing a physical system for background noise mitigation and
the successful met noise signature amplification algorithm. The solution is
over 75% effective at detecting and classifying connection state. The solution
has been constructed without any modification to the existing manual
interconnection process.

### [10] [PULSE: Privileged Knowledge Transfer from Electrodermal Activity to Low-Cost Sensors for Stress Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24058)
*Zihan Zhao,Masood Mortazavi,Ning Yan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: PULSE框架利用EDA信号进行自监督预训练，但在推理阶段仅使用ECG、BVP、ACC和TEMP等低成本传感器，通过知识迁移实现高精度的压力检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EDA是压力检测的主要信号，但硬件成本高且在实际可穿戴设备中不常见。需要开发一种方法，既能利用EDA的优势，又能在推理时使用更易获得的传感器。

Method: 1. 自监督预训练：将编码器输出分为共享和私有嵌入，对齐共享嵌入并融合为模态不变表示；2. 知识迁移：冻结的EDA教师模型将交感神经唤醒表示转移到学生编码器。

Result: 在WESAD数据集上，该方法实现了强大的压力检测性能，表明特权EDA表示可以转移到低成本传感器。

Conclusion: PULSE框架成功地将EDA表示知识迁移到低成本传感器，在保持高精度的同时显著降低了硬件成本。

Abstract: Electrodermal activity (EDA), the primary signal for stress detection,
requires costly hardware often unavailable in real-world wearables. In this
paper, we propose PULSE, a framework that utilizes EDA exclusively during
self-supervised pretraining, while enabling inference without EDA but with more
readily available modalities such as ECG, BVP, ACC, and TEMP. Our approach
separates encoder outputs into shared and private embeddings. We align shared
embeddings across modalities and fuse them into a modality-invariant
representation. The private embeddings carry modality-specific information to
support the reconstruction objective. Pretraining is followed by knowledge
transfer where a frozen EDA teacher transfers sympathetic-arousal
representations into student encoders. On WESAD, our method achieves strong
stress-detection performance, showing that representations of privileged EDA
can be transferred to low-cost sensors to improve accuracy while reducing
hardware cost.

Abstract: In-band Full-duplex joint communication and sensing systems require self
interference cancellation as well as decoupling of the mutual interference
between UL communication signals and radar echoes. We present sub-band
full-duplex as an alternative duplexing scheme to achieve simultaneous uplink
communication and target parameter estimation in a cell-free massive MIMO
system. Sub-band full-duplex allows uplink and downlink transmissions
simultaneously on non-overlapping frequency resources via explicitly defined
uplink and downlink sub-bands in each timeslot. Thus, we propose a sub-band
full-duplex cell-free massive MIMO system with active downlink sensing on
downlink sub-bands and uplink communication on uplink sub-band. In the proposed
system, the target illumination signal is transmitted on the downlink (radar)
sub-band whereas uplink users transmit on the uplink (communication) sub-band.
By assuming efficient suppression of inter-sub-band interference between radar
and communication sub-bands, uplink communication and radar signals can be
efficiently processed without mutual interference. We show that each AP can
estimate sensing parameters with high accuracy in SBFD cell-free massive MIMO
JCAS systems.

Abstract: The advancements in Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) have propelled
the development of signal sensing and identification technologies in
non-cooperative communication scenarios but also enable eavesdroppers to
effectively intercept user signals in wireless communication environments. To
protect user privacy in communication links, we have optimized the adversarial
example generation model and introduced a novel framework for generating
adversarial perturbations for transmitted signals. This framework implements
dual-domain constraints in both the time and frequency domains, ensuring that
the adversarial perturbation cannot be filtered out. Comparative experiments
confirm the superiority of the proposed method and the concealment of the
adversarial examples it generates.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究通过设计OFDM导频失真来干扰基站的时间到达估计，同时保持通信性能。提出了一种复杂的子载波失真向量设计方法，通过增加失配模糊函数的旁瓣来降低ToA估计精度，同时控制通信容量的损失。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种在通信约束下控制ToA可观测性的信号级机制，无需协议更改或人工路径注入。

Abstract: We study uplink orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) pilot
distortion to deliberately obfuscate time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation at a
single base station while preserving communication performance. We design a
complex per-subcarrier distortion vector that increases sidelobes of the
mismatched ambiguity function (MAF) relative to its mainlobe, using two
objectives: the sidelobe-to-peak level ratio and the integrated sidelobe level.
The design is subject to a transmit-power budget and a proximity
(dissimilarity) constraint around the communication-optimal pilot.
Communication impact is quantied by a capacity-motivated lower bound obtained
from the linear minimum mean-squared error error covariance with a mismatched
channel estimate. The resulting generalized fractional program is solved with
Dinkelbach's transform and a difference-of-convex update that yields a
closed-form Karush-Kuhn-Tucker step. Simulations on a single-input
single-output OFDM link show that the optimized distortions raise MAF sidelobes
and degrade delay estimation, as validated by a mismatched maximum-likelihood
ToA estimator, while incurring only marginal capacity loss over a broad
signal-to-noise ratio range. The method requires no protocol changes or
artificial path injection and provides a signal-level mechanism to control ToA
observability under communication constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a full-duplex (FD) Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) system, in which the base station (BS) performs downlink
and uplink communications with multiple users while simultaneously sensing
multiple targets. In the scope of this work, we assume a narrowband and static
scenario, aiming to focus on the beamforming and power allocation strategies.
We propose a joint beamforming strategy for designing transmit and receive
beamformer vectors at the BS. The optimization problem aims to maximize the
communication sum-rate, which is critical for ensuring high-quality service to
users, while also maintaining accurate sensing performance for detection tasks
and adhering to maximum power constraints for efficient resource usage. The
optimal receive beamformers are first derived using a closed-form Generalized
Rayleigh Quotient (GRQ) solution, reducing the variables to be optimized. Then,
the remaining problem is solved using floating-point Genetic Algorithms (GA).
The numerical results show that the proposed GA-based solution demonstrates up
to a 98% enhancement in sum-rate compared to a baseline half-duplex ISAC system
and provides better performance than a benchmark algorithm from the literature.
Additionally, it offers insights into sensing performance effects on beam

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在未知地形环境中，设计高效安全的无人机轨迹对于低空无线网络部署至关重要，但面临环境信息缺失的挑战。

Method: 采用数字孪生框架，无人机通过集成感知与通信信号构建虚拟环境，结合模拟退火算法进行用户调度，使用TD3算法设计连续轨迹。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法相比基线方法具有更快的收敛速度、更高的飞行安全性和更短的任务完成时间。

Conclusion: 该框架为未知环境中的低空无线网络部署提供了稳健高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as key enablers for low-altitude
wireless network (LAWN), particularly when terrestrial networks are
unavailable. In such scenarios, the environmental topology is typically
unknown; hence, designing efficient and safe UAV trajectories is essential yet
challenging. To address this, we propose a digital twin (DT)-assisted training
and deployment framework. In this framework, the UAV transmits integrated
sensing and communication signals to provide communication services to ground
users, while simultaneously collecting echoes that are uploaded to the DT
server to progressively construct virtual environments (VEs). These VEs
accelerate model training and are continuously updated with real-time UAV
sensing data during deployment, supporting decision-making and enhancing flight
safety. Based on this framework, we further develop a trajectory design scheme
that integrates simulated annealing for efficient user scheduling with the
twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for continuous
trajectory design, aiming to minimize mission completion time while ensuring
obstacle avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach
achieves faster convergence, higher flight safety, and shorter mission
completion time compared with baseline methods, providing a robust and
efficient solution for LAWN deployment in unknown environments.

### [16] [Towards actionable hypotension prediction -- predicting catecholamine therapy initiation in the intensive care unit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24287)
*Richard Koebe,Noah Saibel,Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz,Simon Schäfer,Nils Strodthoff*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个机器学习模型来预测ICU患者中儿茶酚胺治疗的启动，相比传统基于固定血压阈值的低血压预测，这种方法更符合临床决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU患者低血压常见且危及生命，儿茶酚胺治疗是关键的干预步骤。现有机器学习模型主要预测低血压阈值，忽略了临床治疗升级的决策过程。预测儿茶酚胺启动能提供更临床可操作的决策支持。

Method: 使用MIMIC-III数据库，将儿茶酚胺启动建模为15分钟预测窗口内的二元事件。输入特征包括两小时滑动平均动脉压统计描述符、人口统计学、生命体征、合并症和当前治疗。采用XGBoost模型训练，并通过SHAP进行解释。

Result: 模型AUROC达到0.822，显著优于基于MAP<65的低血压基线（AUROC 0.686）。SHAP分析显示近期MAP值、MAP趋势和当前治疗是主要预测因子。亚组分析显示在男性、年轻患者、高BMI患者以及无合并症患者中表现更好。

Conclusion: 基于MAP动态、治疗背景和患者特征预测儿茶酚胺启动，支持治疗升级的关键决策，将重点从基于阈值的警报转向可操作的决策支持。这种方法在自然事件不平衡的广泛ICU人群中是可行的。

Abstract: Hypotension in critically ill ICU patients is common and life-threatening.
Escalation to catecholamine therapy marks a key management step, with both
undertreatment and overtreatment posing risks. Most machine learning (ML)
models predict hypotension using fixed MAP thresholds or MAP forecasting,
overlooking the clinical decision behind treatment escalation. Predicting
catecholamine initiation, the start of vasoactive or inotropic agent
administration offers a more clinically actionable target reflecting real
decision-making. Using the MIMIC-III database, we modeled catecholamine
initiation as a binary event within a 15-minute prediction window. Input
features included statistical descriptors from a two-hour sliding MAP context
window, along with demographics, biometrics, comorbidities, and ongoing
treatments. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was trained and
interpreted via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The model achieved an
AUROC of 0.822 (0.813-0.830), outperforming the hypotension baseline (MAP < 65,
AUROC 0.686 [0.675-0.699]). SHAP analysis highlighted recent MAP values, MAP
trends, and ongoing treatments (e.g., sedatives, electrolytes) as dominant
predictors. Subgroup analysis showed higher performance in males, younger
patients (<53 years), those with higher BMI (>32), and patients without
comorbidities or concurrent medications. Predicting catecholamine initiation
based on MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics supports
the critical decision of when to escalate therapy, shifting focus from
threshold-based alarms to actionable decision support. This approach is
feasible across a broad ICU cohort under natural event imbalance. Future work
should enrich temporal and physiological context, extend label definitions to
include therapy escalation, and benchmark against existing hypotension
prediction systems.

*Yiming Zhu,Zhuhong Zhu,Xiaodong Xu,Hongwei Hou,Wenjin Wang,Rui Ding*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种与CP-OFDMA框架兼容的恒包络波形设计，解决了OFDM功率效率低的问题，同时保持了多用户下行传输的兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFDM在现代无线通信系统中广泛应用，但其功率效率受到高包络波动的限制。现有高效功率波形大多与CP-OFDMA框架不兼容，在多用户下行传输中效果不佳。

Method: 从通用恒包络FDMA信号模型出发，开发CP-OFDMA兼容的波形实现结构，设计优化的恒包络约束脉冲整形滤波器以抑制带外发射。针对恒包络调制导致的非平坦频域导频，优化时域二进制导频序列，提出结合延迟域去噪与功率延迟剖面估计的多阶段方法。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提方案实现了接近理想情况的误码率性能，同时相比现有恒包络波形解决方案显著降低了收发器复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方案成功解决了OFDM功率效率问题，实现了与现有标准兼容的高效恒包络波形设计，为多用户下行传输提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: OFDM is widely adopted in modern wireless communication systems, but its
power efficiency is limited by high envelope fluctuations. Although various
high power-efficiency waveforms have been proposed, most are incompatible with
the CP-OFDMA framework and remain ineffective in multi-user downlink
transmissions. To address this issue, we propose a constant-envelope (CE)
waveform design, which enables low-complexity transceiver architectures while
maintaining full compatibility with the prevailing CP-OFDMA framework.
Specifically, we start from a general CE FDMA signal model and develop a
CP-OFDMA-compatible waveform implementation structure, followed by the design
of an optimized CE-constrained pulse-shaping filter to suppress out-of-band
emissions. To tackle channel estimation challenge under non-flat
frequency-domain pilots induced by CE modulation, we optimize the time-domain
binary pilot sequence to achieve frequency-domain CE properties, and then
propose a multi-stage method combining delay-domain denoising with power delay
profile estimation to facilitate reduced-dimension LMMSE estimation.
Subsequently, we design a low-complexity maximum ratio combining-aided LMMSE
equalizer by exploiting the periodicity and conjugate symmetry of the CE
received signals. To mitigate the downlink peak-to-average power ratio increase
caused by FDMA, we further develop a multi-user downlink CE transmission scheme
including multiple access mechanism, downlink control information design, and
corresponding system-level implementation, which ensures compatibility with the
New Radio standard. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme
achieves bit error rate performance close to the ideal case while significantly
reducing transceiver complexity compared to existing CE waveform solutions.

TL;DR: 提出了基于学习的CSI预测框架，利用无线信道的时间相关性预测未来SINR值，有效缓解TDD 5G系统中的信道老化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TDD系统中用户移动性和处理延迟导致的信道老化会降低CSI准确性，影响链路自适应和系统性能

Method: 使用全连接DNN和LSTM网络在有效SINR域进行预测，通过EESM映射确保与现有5G标准兼容

Result: LSTM预测器在中等多普勒条件下比无预测基线实现了2 dB的NMSE改进和1.2 Mbps吞吐量增益

Conclusion: 轻量级AI-based CSI预测能有效缓解信道老化，增强TDD 5G系统的链路自适应性能

Abstract: Time division duplexing (TDD) has become the dominant duplexing mode in 5G
and beyond due to its ability to exploit channel reciprocity for efficient
downlink channel state information (CSI) acquisition. However, channel aging
caused by user mobility and processing delays degrades the accuracy of CSI,
leading to suboptimal link adaptation and loss of performance. To address this
issue, we propose a learning-based CSI prediction framework that leverages
temporal correlations in wireless channels to forecast future signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) values. The prediction operates in the
effective SINR domain, obtained via exponential effective SINR mapping (EESM),
ensuring full compatibility with existing 5G standards without requiring
continuous pilot signaling. Two models are considered: a fully connected deep
neural network (DNN) and an long short-term memory (LSTM)-based network. The
simulation results show that the LSTM predictor achieves an improvement of up
to 2 dB in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and a gain of up to 1.2 Mbps
throughput over a baseline without prediction under moderate Doppler
conditions. These results confirm the potential of lightweight AI-based CSI
prediction to effectively mitigate channel aging and enhance link adaptation in
TDD 5G systems.

Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, implementing
AI-based techniques to improve wireless transceivers becomes an emerging
research topic. Within this context, AI-based channel characterization and
estimation become the focus since these methods have not been solved by
traditional methods very well and have become the bottleneck of transceiver
efficiency in large-scale orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
systems. Specifically, by formulating channel estimation as a generative AI
problem, generative AI methods such as diffusion models (DMs) can efficiently
deal with rough initial estimations and have great potential to cooperate with
traditional signal processing methods. This paper focuses on the transceiver
design of OFDM systems based on DMs, provides an illustration of the potential
of DMs in wireless transceivers, and points out the related research directions
brought by DMs. We also provide a proof-of-concept case study of further
adapting DMs for better wireless receiver performance.

### [20] [Quality Coefficients for Interferometric Phase Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24512)
*Magnus Heimpel,Irena Hajnsek,Othmar Frey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种质量系数用于多时相InSAR中的相位链接质量评估：基于闭合相位的内部一致性系数、拟合优度系数和模糊度系数，用于像素选择和可靠性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多时相InSAR中，相位链接估计的相位历史需要评估其可靠性，以排除不可靠像素。现有方法缺乏统一的质量评估标准。

Method: 在统一数学框架下提出三种标准化质量系数：闭合相位系数评估相位信息内部一致性，拟合优度系数评估相位历史估计与优化模型的匹配程度，模糊度系数比较原始估计与正交替代的拟合优度。

Result: 在瑞士Visp的TerraSAR-X数据实验中，闭合相位系数有效预筛选稳定区域，拟合优度系数与现有质量指标一致并系统化推广，模糊度系数标记拟合良好但不稳定的解。

Conclusion: 这三种系数共同实现了分布式散射体干涉处理中的系统性像素选择和质量控制，提高了跨不同堆栈尺寸的可解释性。

Abstract: In multi-temporal InSAR, phase linking refers to the estimation of a
single-reference interferometric phase history from the information contained
in the coherence matrix of a distributed scatterer. Since the phase information
in the coherence matrix is typically inconsistent, the extent to which the
estimated phase history captures it must be assessed to exclude unreliable
pixels from further processing. We introduce three quality criteria in the form
of coefficients, for threshold-based pixel selection: a coefficient based on
closure phase that quantifies the internal consistency of the phase information
in the coherence matrix; a goodness-of-fit coefficient that quantifies how well
a resulting phase history estimate approximates the phase information according
to the characteristic optimization model of a given phase linking method; and
an ambiguity coefficient that compares the goodness of fit of the original
estimate with that of an orthogonal alternative. We formulate the phase linking
methods and these criteria within a unified mathematical framework and discuss
computational and algorithmic aspects. Unlike existing goodness-of-fit
indicators, the proposed coefficients are normalized to the unit interval with
explicit noise-floor correction, improving interpretability across stacks of
different size. Experiments on TerraSAR-X data over Visp, Switzerland, indicate
that the closure phase coefficient effectively pre-screens stable areas, the
goodness-of-fit coefficient aligns with and systematically generalizes
established quality indicators, and the ambiguity coefficient flags solutions
that fit well but are unstable. Together, the coefficients enable systematic
pixel selection and quality control in the interferometric processing of
distributed scatterers.

Abstract: 6G wireless networks are poised to seamlessly integrate communication,
computing, localization, and sensing functionalities, ensuring high reliability
and trustworthiness. This paper introduces Smart Sensing Feedback (SSF), a
limited-feedback framework designed to enhance sensing capabilities while
maintaining communication performance. SSF adapts the concept of retransmission
from communication to sensing. Specifically, we focus on downlink (DL) bistatic
sensing, where the User Equipment (UE) performs measurements from reflected
sensing signals and provides feedback to the network (NW). In sensing services,
UE reporting can vary significantly due to dynamic factors such as target
characteristics, environmental conditions, and UE status. Our results
demonstrate that SSF significantly improves sensing quality while preserving
communication efficiency. Additionally, it enhances key performance metrics
such as probability of detection, latency, and power consumption. These
improvements underscore SSF's ability to deliver robust, low-overhead feedback
and adaptability to support a wide range of ISAC applications.

Motivation: 大多数报道的超表面工作频率较高，受限于介质基板的物理尺寸，限制了全波系统应用。本研究旨在开发适用于低频S波段的宽带数字反射超表面。

Method: 采用梯形和M形贴片通过PIN二极管连接的电子可重构超原子设计，构建20x20单元超表面阵列，通过动态调整编码序列实现功能控制。

Conclusion: 该宽带超表面可作为增强雷达和无线系统频谱效率和安全性性能的有效候选方案，支持高分辨率目标检测、抗干扰波束控制和物理层安全。

Abstract: Digital metasurfaces have attracted significant attention in recent years due
to their ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves for secure sensing
and communication. However, most reported metasurfaces operate at relatively
high frequencies, primarily due to the constraints imposed by the physical
scale of the dielectric substrate, thus limiting their full-wave system
applications. In this work, a wideband digital reflective metasurface is
presented for capable of dynamically controlling EM waves, with multifunctional
applications in the lower-frequency S-band. The metasurface is composed of
electronically reconfigurable meta-atoms with wideband characteristics, and
designed by using trapezoidal and M-shaped patches connected by a pin diode.
Simulation results show that the proposed digital metasurface could achieve
wideband 1-bit phase quantization with a stable phase difference within 180
degree +/- 25 degree and small reflection loss below 0.6 dB from 2.72 to 3.25
GHz. To validate the proposed design, a 20x20-unit metasurface array was
designed, simulated and fabricated. By dynamically adjusting the coding
sequence, the metasurface could enable multi-mode orbital angular momentum
(OAM) beam generation, dynamic beam scanning, and precise direction finding.
These capabilities support secure sensing and secure communications through
high-resolution target detection and anti-jamming beam steering, as well as
physical-layer security. The proposed wideband metasurface may serve as an
effective candidate for enhancing spectral efficiency and security performance
in radar and wireless systems.

Conclusion: 早期融合和更深层次的上下文建模在基于Transformer的多模态情感分析中具有显著优势

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by
jointly analyzing data from multiple modalities typically text and images
offering a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches. In
this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful
Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input
through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal
interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further
enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual
Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN
incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine
textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text
and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning.
Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy
(78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on
MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements
highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in
Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.

*Alexandre Benoit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过分析MACE力场的计算瓶颈，评估了低精度执行策略，发现cuEquivariance后端和混合精度推理可显著加速SO(3)-等变力场，同时保持物理保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习力场虽然能提供精确的分子动力学模拟，但计算成本高昂。目前缺乏关于降低精度算术和GPU优化内核是否能减少成本而不损害物理保真度的系统证据。

Method: 对MACE进行端到端和逐块分析，比较e3nn和cuEquivariance后端，评估FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16设置下的推理、NVT/NPT水模拟和训练运行，采用可重复的稳态计时。

Result: cuEquivariance将推理延迟降低约3倍；仅将线性层转换为BF16/FP16可在FP32模型中获得约4倍额外加速；NVT/NPT MD中的能量和热力学观测量保持在运行间变异性范围内；训练中的半精度权重会降低力RMSE。

Conclusion: 融合等变内核和混合精度推理可显著加速最先进的力场，对下游MD影响可忽略。建议默认使用cuEquivariance和FP32，对线性层启用BF16/FP16以获得最大吞吐量，训练保持FP32。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields can deliver accurate molecular dynamics (MD) at
high computational cost. For SO(3)-equivariant models such as MACE, there is
little systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and
GPU-optimized kernels can cut this cost without harming physical fidelity. This
thesis aims to make MACE cheaper and faster while preserving accuracy by
identifying computational bottlenecks and evaluating low-precision execution
policies. We profile MACE end-to-end and per block, compare the e3nn and NVIDIA
cuEquivariance backends, and assess FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 settings (with FP32
accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water simulations, and toy
training runs under reproducible, steady-state timing. cuEquivariance reduces
inference latency by about $3\times$. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16
within an FP32 model yields roughly 4x additional speedups, while energies and
thermodynamic observables in NVT/NPT MD remain within run-to-run variability.
Half-precision weights during training degrade force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq
modules without explicit adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused
equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate
state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on downstream MD. A
practical policy is to use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable
BF16/FP16 for linear layers (keeping FP32 accumulations) for maximum
throughput, while training remains in FP32. Further gains are expected on
Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and
pipeline fusion.

Method: 通过威胁建模、实验基准测试和模型评估，在皮肤病数据集上进行实证实验，测试对抗性训练和蒸馏等防御方法。

Result: 对抗性方法显著降低了分类准确性，防御方法虽然降低了攻击成功率，但需要在干净数据上的模型性能之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 需要整合技术、伦理和政策方法，构建更具韧性和公平性的医疗AI系统。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a severe risk to AI systems used in healthcare,
capable of misleading models into dangerous misclassifications that can delay
treatments or cause misdiagnoses. These attacks, often imperceptible to human
perception, threaten patient safety, particularly in underserved populations.
Our study explores these vulnerabilities through empirical experimentation on a
dermatological dataset, where adversarial methods significantly reduce
classification accuracy. Through detailed threat modeling, experimental
benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the
threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and
distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates,
they must be balanced against model performance on clean data. We conclude with
a call for integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches to build
more resilient, equitable AI in healthcare.

Motivation: 虽然深度强化学习在自动驾驶中有广泛应用，但很少使用选项框架，而该框架天然适合分层控制应用，特别是自动驾驶任务。

Method: 定义了嵌入安全和舒适约束的纵向和横向操控专用选项，提出了分层控制设置，并基于最先进强化学习技术推导实用算法，通过分别选择纵向和横向控制动作实现灵活策略。

Conclusion: 选项框架能够将先验领域知识融入学习过程，更容易约束学习到的驾驶行为，同时保持与人类驾驶员相同的表达能力和灵活性。

Abstract: Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous
driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is
surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control
applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore,
in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous
driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for
longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort
constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the
learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more
easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and
derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral
control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the
same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier
to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the
investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform
the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies
over actions.

TL;DR: 提出了DiNo和RanBu两种浅层森林方法，将少量深度受限的树转换为高效的距离加权预测器，显著降低推理延迟和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机森林在表格预测任务中表现优异，但依赖数百棵深树导致高推理延迟和内存需求，限制了在延迟敏感或资源受限环境中的部署。

Method: DiNo通过观测对的最远共同祖先测量同源距离，RanBu对Breiman的经典邻近度度量应用核平滑。两种方法都在森林训练后完全操作，无需额外生长树。

Result: 在3个合成基准和25个公共数据集上，RanBu匹配或超过全深度随机森林的准确性（特别是在高噪声设置中），同时将训练加推理时间减少高达95%。DiNo在低噪声机制中实现最佳偏差-方差权衡。

Conclusion: 两种方法都能直接扩展到分位数回归，在保持准确性的同时获得显著的速度提升，为资源受限环境提供了高效的随机森林替代方案。

Abstract: Random Forest ensembles are a strong baseline for tabular prediction tasks,
but their reliance on hundreds of deep trees often results in high inference
latency and memory demands, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
resource-constrained environments. We introduce DiNo (Distance with Nodes) and
RanBu (Random Bushes), two shallow-forest methods that convert a small set of
depth-limited trees into efficient, distance-weighted predictors. DiNo measures
cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs,
while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure.
Both approaches operate entirely after forest training: no additional trees are
grown, and tuning of the single bandwidth parameter $h$ requires only
lightweight matrix-vector operations. Across three synthetic benchmarks and 25
public datasets, RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random
forests-particularly in high-noise settings-while reducing training plus
inference time by up to 95\%. DiNo achieves the best bias-variance trade-off in
low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both methods extend directly
to quantile regression, maintaining accuracy with substantial speed gains. The
implementation is available as an open-source R/C++ package at
https://github.com/tiagomendonca/dirf. We focus on structured tabular random
samples (i.i.d.), leaving extensions to other modalities for future work.

*Shuang Geng,Wenli Zhang,Jiaheng Xie,Rui Wang,Sudha Ram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个闭环LLM-知识图谱框架，将抑郁症检测与医学知识扩展相结合，通过迭代学习循环实现预测与知识演化的相互促进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在利用医学知识提高预测准确性的同时，忽视了通过预测过程扩展医学知识的机会。社交媒体用户生成内容为心理健康监测提供了实时数据源。

Method: 开发闭环LLM-知识图谱框架：1) 知识感知抑郁症检测阶段，LLM联合执行抑郁症检测和实体提取，知识图谱表示和加权实体以优化预测；2) 知识精炼与扩展阶段，LLM提取的新实体、关系和实体类型在专家监督下整合到知识图谱中。

Result: 使用大规模UGC数据，框架同时提升了预测准确性和医学理解。专家评估确认发现了与现有文献互补的临床有意义症状、共病和社会触发因素。

Conclusion: 概念化和实现了预测-学习和学习-预测作为相互促进的过程，推进了预测分析的方法论和理论理解。框架展示了计算模型与领域知识的共同演化，为其他动态风险监测环境提供了自适应、数据驱动的知识系统基础。

Abstract: Social media user-generated content (UGC) provides real-time, self-reported
indicators of mental health conditions such as depression, offering a valuable
source for predictive analytics. While prior studies integrate medical
knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to
simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a
Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that
integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.
In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs
depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph
represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the
knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and
entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph
under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using
large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical
understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically
meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to
existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize
prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually
reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical
understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the
co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a
foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other
dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

### [29] [Chain of Execution Supervision Promotes General Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23629)
*Nuo Chen,Zehua Li,Keqin Bao,Junyang Lin,Dayiheng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TracePile是一个包含260万样本的大规模语料库，将代码执行转化为显式的逐步推理链（Chain of Execution），通过在数学、算法等领域的训练，显著提升了LLaMA、Qwen等模型在数学、代码、逻辑和算法任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码具有丰富的逻辑结构和多样化的推理范式，但代码中的推理往往是隐式的，并与语法或实现噪声纠缠在一起，使得直接在原始代码上训练效果不佳。

Method: 提出TracePile语料库，将代码执行转化为显式的逐步推理链（CoE），包含变量追踪问题和代码重写，使用三种训练设置：继续预训练、预训练后指令微调、两阶段微调。

Result: 在四个基础模型（LLaMA 3、LLaMA 3.1、Qwen-2.5、Qwen-2.5 Coder）和20个基准测试上的实验显示了一致的改进，LLaMA3.1-8B在九个数学数据集上平均提升7.1%，在LiveCodeBench、CRUX和MMLU上也有明显提升。

Conclusion: TracePile通过将代码执行转化为显式推理链，有效提升了语言模型的推理能力，证明了代码作为训练数据在增强模型逻辑推理方面的潜力。

Abstract: Building robust and general reasoning ability is a central goal in the
development of large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts increasingly turn
to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and
diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering,
and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and
entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw
code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus
of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit,
step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of
Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical
algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing
questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code
diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups:
continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage
finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5,
and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and
algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements. Notably, TracePile boosts
LLaMA3.1-8B by 7.1\% on average across nine math datasets and delivers clear
gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU under two-stage fine-tuning.

*Ninghui Feng,Yiyan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出数字到事件推理任务，通过推理感知框架从数值时间序列中推断可解释的结构化事件，解决了传统方法只关注预测而忽略潜在事件驱动因素的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多模态推理方面表现出色，但对纯数值时间序列信号的理解有限。现有方法主要关注预测或趋势描述，未能揭示驱动数值变化的潜在事件或解释推理过程。

Method: 提出推理感知框架，包含代理引导事件提取器(AGE)、标记多元霍克斯合成生成器(EveDTS)，以及结合时间序列编码器和结构化解码器的两阶段微调管道。模型显式推理数值变化，生成中间解释，输出结构化事件假设。

Result: 在多领域数据集上的实验表明，该方法在事件级精确率和召回率方面显著优于强LLM基线。

Conclusion: 这项工作为连接定量推理和语义理解提供了新方向，使LLM能够直接从数值动态中解释和预测事件。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal
reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series
signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or
trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical
changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we
introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to
infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current
text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment
challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an
agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based
synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a
time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons
over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs
structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our
method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision
and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative
reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict
events directly from numerical dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO)框架，通过最大似然估计将偏好优化与排序选择建模统一起来，支持多选和排名反馈格式，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐主要依赖成对偏好优化，忽略了从更丰富的人类反馈形式（如多选比较和top-k排名）中学习的机会。

Method: 提出了RCPO统一框架，支持基于效用和基于排名的选择模型，包含多种现有成对方法，并为更丰富的反馈格式提供原则性训练目标。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-it模型上的实证研究表明，RCPO在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard基准测试中持续优于竞争基线。

Conclusion: RCPO展示了直接利用排序偏好数据结合适当选择模型能够实现更有效的对齐，为将排序选择建模融入LLM训练提供了通用且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on
pairwise preference optimization, where annotators select the better of two
responses to a prompt. While simple, this approach overlooks the opportunity to
learn from richer forms of human feedback, such as multiwise comparisons and
top-$k$ rankings. We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a
unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice
modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible,
supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several
existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled
training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework
with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and
Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms
competitive baselines. RCPO shows how directly leveraging ranked preference
data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment.
It offers a versatile and extensible foundation for incorporating (ranked)
choice modeling into LLM training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMCOMP是一种基于解码器大型语言模型的科学数据压缩方法，通过量化、Z-order曲线和覆盖引导采样将3D场转换为离散标记，使用自回归变换器建模标记转换，在严格误差约束下实现高压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率科学模拟和观测系统产生海量时空数据，需要高效、有误差约束的压缩方法。同时，解码器大型语言模型在建模复杂序列数据方面表现出色。

Method: 将3D场量化为离散标记，通过Z-order曲线排列保持局部性，应用覆盖引导采样提高训练效率。使用带时空嵌入的自回归变换器建模标记转换，压缩时执行top-k预测，仅存储排名索引和回退校正以确保严格误差约束。

Result: 在多个再分析数据集上的实验表明，LLMCOMP在严格误差约束下始终优于最先进的压缩器，压缩比提高高达30%。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了LLM作为高保真科学数据通用压缩器的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation
systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient,
error-bounded compression increasingly important. Meanwhile, decoder-only large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling
complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy
compression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific
data. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via
Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to
enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with
spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the
model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback
corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis
datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error
bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose
compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.

TL;DR: 提出Noise Combination Sampling方法，通过合成最优噪声向量来近似测量分数，将条件信息自然嵌入扩散模型的生成过程，无需逐步超参数调优，在少量生成步骤下实现优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型在零样本逆问题求解中面临两难：过度集成观测信息会破坏生成过程，而集成不足则无法强调逆问题的约束条件。

Method: 提出噪声组合采样方法，从噪声子空间合成最优噪声向量来近似测量分数，替代标准DDPM过程中的噪声项，使条件信息自然嵌入生成过程。

Result: 该方法可应用于广泛的逆问题求解器，包括图像压缩，在生成步骤较少时实现优越性能，计算开销可忽略，显著提高鲁棒性和稳定性。

Conclusion: Noise Combination Sampling方法有效解决了扩散模型在逆问题求解中的集成困境，提供了一种无需超参数调优的稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into
the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an
inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process,
while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by
the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination
Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise
subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the
standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables
conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process
without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied
to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and,
particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves
superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly
improving robustness and stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受集合包含问题应用的启发，研究如何设计集合到向量的函数，使得集合的自然偏序关系得以保持，即S⊆T当且仅当F(S)≤F(T)。

Method: 建立了MAS函数向量维度的上下界，在无限基础集情况下提出了弱MAS模型，该模型具有Holder连续性稳定性。

Result: 证明了在无限基础集上MAS函数不存在，但提出的弱MAS模型在实验中优于不包含集合包含归纳偏置的标准集合模型。

Conclusion: MAS函数可用于构建通用模型，这些模型本质上是单调的，并能近似所有单调集合函数。实验表明包含集合包含关系的模型在集合包含任务中表现更优。

Abstract: Motivated by applications for set containment problems, we consider the
following fundamental problem: can we design set-to-vector functions so that
the natural partial order on sets is preserved, namely $S\subseteq T \text{ if
and only if } F(S)\leq F(T) $. We call functions satisfying this property
Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions. % We establish lower and upper
bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain MAS functions, as a
function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set. In
the important case of an infinite ground set, we show that MAS functions do not
exist, but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed MAS
property we name "weakly MAS" and is stable in the sense of Holder continuity.
We also show that MAS functions can be used to construct universal models that
are monotone by construction and can approximate all monotone set functions.
Experimentally, we consider a variety of set containment tasks. The experiments
show the benefit of using our our model, in comparison with standard set models
which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias. Our code is
available in https://github.com/yonatansverdlov/Monotone-Embedding.

TL;DR: 本研究在真实用户环境中评估Skeptical Learning (SKEL)方法，通过iLog移动应用让大学生在四周内使用，验证了SKEL在减少标注工作量和提高数据质量方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字个人助理需要高质量标注，但用户标注常存在错误和噪声。先前SKEL研究缺乏终端用户的确认，而用户才是自身情境的最佳评判者。

Method: 让大学生在真实环境中使用iLog移动应用四周，用户可根据当前视角和需求细化输入标签，评估SKEL在实际使用条件下的表现。

Result: 研究揭示了在用户努力与数据质量之间找到适当平衡的挑战，同时证明了SKEL可以减少标注工作量并提高收集数据的质量。

Conclusion: SKEL在真实用户环境中具有应用潜力，但需要仔细权衡用户参与度与数据质量之间的关系。

Abstract: Any digital personal assistant, whether used to support task performance,
answer questions, or manage work and daily life, including fitness schedules,
requires high-quality annotations to function properly. However, user
annotations, whether actively produced or inferred from context (e.g., data
from smartphone sensors), are often subject to errors and noise. Previous
research on Skeptical Learning (SKEL) addressed the issue of noisy labels by
comparing offline active annotations with passive data, allowing for an
evaluation of annotation accuracy. However, this evaluation did not include
confirmation from end-users, the best judges of their own context. In this
study, we evaluate SKEL's performance in real-world conditions with actual
users who can refine the input labels based on their current perspectives and
needs. The study involves university students using the iLog mobile application
on their devices over a period of four weeks. The results highlight the
challenges of finding the right balance between user effort and data quality,
as well as the potential benefits of using SKEL, which include reduced
annotation effort and improved quality of collected data.

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as
delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This
paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay
prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers
monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach
integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,
including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by
adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace
conditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves
sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information
related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic
understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory
information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows
practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time
updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

Motivation: 研究在有限自适应约束下的广义线性上下文赌博机问题，解决在策略更新次数受限的情况下如何设计高效的算法。

Method: 提出了两种算法：B-GLinCB用于预先确定策略更新轮次的设置，RS-GLinCB用于自适应执行策略更新的设置。

Result: B-GLinCB在M=Ω(log log T)时达到Õ(√T)遗憾，RS-GLinCB更新策略Õ(log² T)次且达到Õ(√T)遗憾，即使在对抗性臂特征向量生成下也有效。

Conclusion: 成功设计了在有限自适应约束下有效的广义线性上下文赌博机算法，并消除了对非线性参数κ的依赖，这一方法可能具有独立的研究价值。

Abstract: We study the generalized linear contextual bandit problem within the
constraints of limited adaptivity. In this paper, we present two algorithms,
$\texttt{B-GLinCB}$ and $\texttt{RS-GLinCB}$, that address, respectively, two
prevalent limited adaptivity settings. Given a budget $M$ on the number of
policy updates, in the first setting, the algorithm needs to decide upfront $M$
rounds at which it will update its policy, while in the second setting it can
adaptively perform $M$ policy updates during its course. For the first setting,
we design an algorithm $\texttt{B-GLinCB}$, that incurs $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$
regret when $M = \Omega( \log{\log T} )$ and the arm feature vectors are
generated stochastically. For the second setting, we design an algorithm
$\texttt{RS-GLinCB}$ that updates its policy $\tilde{O}(\log^2 T)$ times and
achieves a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ even when the arm feature vectors
are adversarially generated. Notably, in these bounds, we manage to eliminate
the dependence on a key instance dependent parameter $\kappa$, that captures
non-linearity of the underlying reward model. Our novel approach for removing
this dependence for generalized linear contextual bandits might be of
independent interest.

Conclusion: 整合响应时间数据可以显著改善奖励模型学习效果，为偏好学习提供了更高效的框架，特别是在处理复杂奖励函数时表现出色。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

Abstract: Multimodal molecular models often suffer from 3D conformer unreliability and
modality collapse, limiting their robustness and generalization. We propose
MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges
in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the
instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion
Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and
stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion,
we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically
integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific
modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space
backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information
propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and
MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the
best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a
27% improvement on the LD50 task. These results validate its robustness to 3D
conformer noise and the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in molecular
representation. The code is available at: github.com/selmiss/MuMo.

TL;DR: 提出了SAL-T（空间感知线性Transformer），一种物理启发的线性注意力架构，通过基于运动学特征的空间分区和卷积层来降低计算复杂度，在保持性能的同时显著减少资源消耗和推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在高能粒子碰撞中能有效捕捉全局和局部相关性，但其二次复杂度在CERN LHC等高数据吞吐量环境中带来部署挑战，需要大量资源并增加推理延迟。

Method: 基于linformer架构，引入基于运动学特征的空间感知粒子分区，计算物理意义区域间的注意力，并使用卷积层捕捉局部相关性（借鉴喷注物理学的见解）。

Result: 在喷注分类任务中优于标准linformer，性能与全注意力Transformer相当，但资源消耗显著减少且推理延迟更低。在ModelNet10点云分类数据集上也验证了这一趋势。

Conclusion: SAL-T通过物理启发的空间分区和局部相关性捕捉，在保持Transformer性能优势的同时，有效解决了高数据吞吐量环境中的部署挑战。

Abstract: Transformers are very effective in capturing both global and local
correlations within high-energy particle collisions, but they present
deployment challenges in high-data-throughput environments, such as the CERN
LHC. The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial
resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these
issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a
physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains
linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of
particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between
regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers
to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In
addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks,
SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention
transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency
during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset
(ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at
https://github.com/aaronw5/SAL-T4HEP.

TL;DR: 提出一个原则性框架来减轻奖励模型中的虚假相关性偏见，同时保留反映真实偏好的潜在因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐技术（如人类反馈强化学习）中的奖励模型经常利用虚假相关性（如回复长度、歧视、阿谀奉承等），这个问题日益受到关注。

Method: 首先建立数据生成过程的数学表述，假设观测数据来自虚假和非虚假潜在变量。通过变分推断恢复非虚假变量，并利用它们训练奖励模型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效缓解了虚假相关性问题，产生了更稳健的奖励模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够识别并分离非虚假潜在变量，从而在减轻偏见的同时保持真实偏好信息，为奖励模型训练提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Recent alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback, have been widely adopted to align large language models with human
preferences by learning and leveraging reward models. In practice, these models
often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length,
discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has
received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework
that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying
factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of
the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is
generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that,
interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically
identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent
variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses
variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train
reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields
more robust reward models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRQK是一种两阶段框架，通过低秩分解查询和键矩阵来减少KV缓存的内存占用，同时保持精确的注意力输出，在长上下文场景下实现显著内存节省且精度损失最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着输入文本长度增加，LLMs中的KV缓存带来过高的GPU内存成本，限制了在资源受限设备上的长上下文推理。现有方法如KV量化和剪枝会损失数值精度或保留次优的键值对。

Method: LRQK在预填充阶段将全精度查询和键矩阵分解为紧凑的秩-r因子，然后在每个解码步骤使用这些低维投影以O(lr)时间计算代理注意力分数。通过选择top-k令牌和少量最近令牌，采用混合GPU-CPU缓存和命中-未命中机制，仅传输缺失的全精度KV对。

Result: 在RULER和LongBench基准测试中使用LLaMA-3-8B和Qwen2.5-7B的实验表明，LRQK在长上下文设置中匹配或超越了领先的稀疏注意力方法，同时实现了显著的内存节省且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: LRQK通过低秩分解和混合缓存机制有效解决了长上下文推理中的内存瓶颈问题，在保持精确注意力输出的同时大幅降低内存使用。

Abstract: As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes
prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource
constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning,
reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal
retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention
(LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query
and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and
then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores
in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the
top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed
GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing
full-precision KV pairs, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while
reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and
LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK
matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings,
while delivering significant memory savings with minimal loss in accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/tenghuilee/LRQK.

TL;DR: 提出了一种物理信息驱动的算子学习方法，将分辨率无关神经算子框架扩展到完全无数据设置，解决了训练数据稀缺和分辨率不均匀的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算子学习方法依赖大量高质量训练数据，但在实际工程应用中获取困难，且数据可能在不同样本间存在分辨率不均匀的问题。

Method: 使用预训练基函数将任意离散化的输入函数投影到潜在嵌入空间，通过多层感知机近似偏微分方程算子，在物理空间中通过有限差分求解器强制执行PDE约束。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理多分辨率数据，在无数据设置下实现准确的算子学习，为实际工程应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the
quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs),
often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be
challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications. These
datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the
grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a
physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution
Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,
addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but
sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent
embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained
basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal
coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are
enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation
and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical
examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at
varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.

Result: 该算法在两种设置中均实现了接近最优的遗憾界，而基于UCB的方法由于缺乏足够的显式探索可能失败。同时提供了匹配的下界。

Conclusion: 提出的消除算法在组合老虎机中有效解决了UCB方法因缺乏显式探索而失败的问题，在多个设置中实现了接近最优的性能。

Abstract: Combinatorial bandits extend the classical bandit framework to settings where
the learner selects multiple arms in each round, motivated by applications such
as online recommendation and assortment optimization. While extensions of upper
confidence bound (UCB) algorithms arise naturally in this context, adapting arm
elimination methods has proved more challenging. We introduce a novel
elimination scheme that partitions arms into three categories (confirmed,
active, and eliminated), and incorporates explicit exploration to update these
sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in two settings: the
combinatorial multi-armed bandit with general graph feedback, and the
combinatorial linear contextual bandit. In both cases, our approach achieves
near-optimal regret, whereas UCB-based methods can provably fail due to
insufficient explicit exploration. Matching lower bounds are also provided.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在资源受限的边缘设备上部署面临挑战，现有层剪枝方法依赖手工指标且忽略层间依赖，会破坏信息流并严重降低性能。

Method: 使用可微分凹门算法通过梯度优化自动识别连续层段进行剪枝，采用端点微调策略仅微调剪枝段相邻层以恢复性能。

Result: 在LLaMA2、LLaMA3和Qwen等多个模型上验证，20%剪枝率下LLaMA3-70B平均性能保留达95.34%，比基线提升4.29%-30.52%。

Conclusion: CLP框架能有效压缩大模型且保持高性能，可与量化技术结合进一步压缩模型，仅带来轻微性能损失。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved revolutionary
breakthroughs in many fields, their large model size and high computational
cost pose significant challenges for practical deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. To this end, layer pruning has been proposed
to reduce the computational overhead by directly removing redundant layers.
However, existing layer pruning methods typically rely on hand-crafted metrics
to evaluate and remove individual layers, while ignoring the dependencies
between layers. This can disrupt the model's information flow and severely
degrade performance. To address these issues, we propose CLP, a novel
continuous layer pruning framework that introduces two key innovations: a
differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies the best
continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization; and a
cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that effectively restores model performance by
fine-tuning only the layers adjacent to the pruned segments. Extensive
experiments across multiple model architectures (including LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and
Qwen) and sizes (from $7$B to $70$B parameters) show that CLP significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. For example, at a pruning rate
of $20\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\%$ on
LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\%$-$30.52\%$. Furthermore, CLP can
be seamlessly combined with quantization to further compress the model with
only a slight performance loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将感知和决策学习耦合在一起，这可能导致感知质量不佳。PeL旨在分离感知和决策，直接优化感知属性而不依赖特定任务目标。

Method: 定义感知属性独立于目标或重参数化，使用表示不变性指标评估感知质量，证明PeL更新保持足够不变性时与贝叶斯任务风险梯度正交。

Result: 提供了任务无关的评估指标套件来认证感知质量，实现了感知学习与决策学习的有效分离。

Conclusion: PeL范式为优化智能体感官接口提供了理论基础和实践方法，能够独立于下游任务提升感知质量。

Abstract: We introduce Perception Learning (PeL), a paradigm that optimizes an agent's
sensory interface $f_\phi:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Z}$ using task-agnostic
signals, decoupled from downstream decision learning
$g_\theta:\mathcal{Z}\to\mathcal{Y}$. PeL directly targets label-free
perceptual properties, such as stability to nuisances, informativeness without
collapse, and controlled geometry, assessed via objective
representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and
decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or
reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient
invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we
provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual
quality.

Conclusion: SAEA框架通过系统调整时空自相关预测误差，有效提升了交通预测模型的准确性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of
research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing
spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of
training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that
the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,
this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by
both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the
performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current
studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally
Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed
to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic
forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a
random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a
spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic
dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error
correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly
formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is
introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned
coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an
inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically
refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time
forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on
different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting
models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够提取有序可识别的特征函数，为理解表示学习中的特征重要性提供了新工具，并支持基于特征值的自适应维度表示。

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning reveal that widely used
objectives, such as contrastive and non-contrastive, implicitly perform
spectral decomposition of a contextual kernel, induced by the relationship
between inputs and their contexts. Yet, these methods recover only the linear
span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition
is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work,
we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable
eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key
desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability
to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms,
low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this
framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on
synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the
recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection,
enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional
representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷等离子体作为一种环保的种子处理方法，其效果难以预测，因为涉及复杂的种子-等离子体-环境相互作用。需要开发预测模型来优化冷等离子体在精准农业中的应用。

Result: Extra Trees模型表现最佳（R²=0.919；RMSE=3.21；MAE=2.62），特征减少后进一步提升至R²=0.925。发现了激素效应：7-15kV电压和200-500s处理时间产生最大萌发提升，而超过20kV或过长时间处理会降低萌发率。不同物种和品种的预测精度存在差异。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了可预测冷等离子体种子处理效果的机器学习框架，并集成到MLflow中，为精准农业提供了决策支持工具，有助于优化冷等离子体种子处理参数。

Abstract: Cold plasma (CP) is an eco-friendly method to enhance seed germination, yet
outcomes remain difficult to predict due to complex seed--plasma--environment
interactions. This study introduces the first machine learning framework to
forecast germination uplift in soybean, barley, sunflower, radish, and tomato
under dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Among the models tested (GB,
XGB, ET, and hybrids), Extra Trees (ET) performed best (R\textsuperscript{2} =
0.919; RMSE = 3.21; MAE = 2.62), improving to R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.925
after feature reduction. Engineering analysis revealed a hormetic response:
negligible effects at $<$7 kV or $<$200 s, maximum germination at 7--15 kV for
200--500 s, and reduced germination beyond 20 kV or prolonged exposures.
Discharge power was also a dominant factor, with germination rate maximizing at
$\geq$100 W with low exposure time. Species and cultivar-level predictions
showed radish (MAE = 1.46) and soybean (MAE = 2.05) were modeled with high
consistency, while sunflower remained slightly higher variable (MAE = 3.80).
Among cultivars, Williams (MAE = 1.23) and Sari (1.33) were well predicted,
while Arian (2.86) and Ny\'{\i}rs\'{e}gi fekete (3.74) were comparatively
poorly captured. This framework was also embedded into MLflow, providing a
decision-support tool for optimizing CP seed germination in precision
agriculture.

Motivation: RLHF在实践中很成功但理论理解有限，现有研究主要关注基于奖励的Bradley-Terry偏好模型，而本文考虑更一般的偏好模型。

Method: 分析KL正则化目标下最优策略类的结构特性，发现贪婪采样就足够，无需构建乐观或悲观估计。

Result: 在一般偏好模型下获得了比现有方法数量级改进的性能保证，并专门针对BT模型验证了贪婪采样的充分性。

Conclusion: RLHF中KL正则化目标的独特结构特性使得贪婪采样足够有效，这为RLHF的理论理解提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
technique for post-training large language models. Despite its empirical
success, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning
the KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional
challenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the
reward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs
utilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general
preference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and
obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over
existing ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that
directly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to
constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This
insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy
class under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT
model, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型(dLLMs)作为自回归生成器的替代方案，其对齐人类偏好具有挑战性，因为序列对数似然难以计算且配对偏好数据收集成本高。

Method: 引入ELBO-KTO方法，结合ELBO替代扩散对数似然和基于前景理论的无配对偏好目标(KTO)，分析ELBO替代带来的偏差和方差，并采用方差减少技术稳定训练梯度。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct上，ELBO-KTO在kto-mix-14k和UltraFeedback-Binary上分别获得65.9%和62.3%的调整胜率。在GSM8K、MMLU等下游任务中，性能与基础模型相当或更好。

Conclusion: 无配对偏好优化是扩散语言模型中配对对齐的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) are an emerging alternative to
autoregressive (AR) generators, but aligning them to human preferences is
challenging because sequence log-likelihoods are intractable and pairwise
preference data are costly to collect. We introduce ELBO-KTO, which combines an
ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-theoretic,
unpaired preference objective (Kahneman Tversky Optimization, KTO). We analyze
the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ
variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training. Applied
to LLaDA-8B-Instruct, ELBO-KTO yields \textbf{65.9\%} and \textbf{62.3\%}
adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively,
versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge. Across downstream tasks,
including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO
trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base
model under identical decoding. This establishes unpaired preference
optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on combining quantum machine
learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational
techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks.
This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network)
for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for
classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine
learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional
and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing
to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to
extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These
features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM
models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to
transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance,
we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified
cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models,
achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This
research highlights the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于肺炎检测的混合量子-经典模型，使用量子卷积神经网络(QNN)处理医学图像，相比传统CNN在PneumoniaMNIST数据集上获得了更高的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在肺炎检测中存在计算成本高、特征表示有限、小数据集泛化能力差等问题，需要探索更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用参数化量子电路(PQC)构建量子卷积层，处理2x2图像块，采用Y旋转门进行数据编码和纠缠层生成非经典特征表示，然后将量子提取的特征输入经典神经网络进行分类。

Result: 提出的QNN模型在验证集上达到83.33%的准确率，而可比较的经典CNN仅为73.33%，显示出更好的收敛性和样本效率。

Conclusion: QNN在医学图像分析特别是标注数据有限的情况下具有潜力，为将量子计算集成到深度学习驱动的医疗诊断系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pneumonia poses a significant global health challenge, demanding accurate and
timely diagnosis. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia
detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in
feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.
To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional
Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature
extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for
pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a
quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2
image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling
layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These
quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves
a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable
classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and
sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the
foundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical
diagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to
traditional approaches.

TL;DR: 提出ST-ViWT框架，结合小波时频表示和transformer注意力机制，从OCO-2卫星数据重建连续、不确定性量化的XCO2场，在加拿大南部禽畜密集区实现高精度CO2制图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确绘制农业景观上空的柱平均CO2浓度对于指导排放减排策略至关重要，特别是在禽畜养殖密集区域。

Method: 融合小波时频表示与transformer注意力机制，整合气象、植被指数、地形和土地覆盖数据，构建时空视觉transformer框架。

Result: 在2024年OCO-2数据上达到R2=0.984和RMSE=0.468 ppm；92.3%的填补预测在±1 ppm内；TCCON验证显示良好泛化能力（偏差=-0.14 ppm，r=0.928）。

Conclusion: 该方法支持卫星约束与国家级清单的整合，实现可扩展、透明、空间明确的碳核算、热点优先排序和政策相关的减排评估。

Abstract: Accurate mapping of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) over agricultural landscapes
is essential for guiding emission mitigation strategies. We present a
Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) framework that
reconstructs continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 fields from OCO-2 across
southern Canada, emphasizing poultry-intensive regions. The model fuses wavelet
time-frequency representations with transformer attention over meteorology,
vegetation indices, topography, and land cover. On 2024 OCO-2 data, ST-ViWT
attains R2 = 0.984 and RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3 percent of gap-filled predictions
lie within +/-1 ppm. Independent validation with TCCON shows robust
generalization (bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928), including faithful reproduction
of the late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions reveals
a moderate positive association between facility density and XCO2 (r = 0.43);
high-density areas exhibit larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced
summer variability. Compared with conventional interpolation and standard
machine-learning baselines, ST-ViWT yields seamless 0.25 degree CO2 surfaces
with explicit uncertainties, enabling year-round coverage despite sparse
observations. The approach supports integration of satellite constraints with
national inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions,
refine region-specific factors, and verify interventions. Importantly,
transformer-based Earth observation enables scalable, transparent, spatially
explicit carbon accounting, hotspot prioritization, and policy-relevant
mitigation assessment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个综合数据驱动框架，通过两种学习方法结合多域信号处理来学习健康指标，用于航空航天复合材料结构的诊断和预后。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于材料特性变化、随机损伤演化和多样损伤模式，提取可靠的健康指标具有挑战性。制造缺陷和使用中事件进一步复杂化了这一过程。

Method: 提出了两种方法：(1) 多样性深度半监督异常检测(Diversity-DeepSAD)，使用连续辅助标签作为假设损伤代理；(2) 退化趋势约束变分自编码器(DTC-VAE)，通过显式趋势约束嵌入单调性准则。使用多激发频率的导波监测疲劳加载下的复合材料结构。

Result: 使用快速傅里叶变换特征，增强的Diversity-DeepSAD模型达到81.6%性能，而DTC-VAE提供了最一致的健康指标，性能达到92.3%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功克服了传统二元标签的局限性，能够捕捉中间退化状态，通过多域信号处理和集成学习有效减轻了频率依赖性并降低了方差。

Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the
condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and
operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to
variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse
damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents
(e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a
comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches
integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are
unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a
diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach
augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies,
which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish
healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a
degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the
monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided
waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener
composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency
representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised
ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using
fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved
81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3%
performance, outperforming existing baselines.

Motivation: 压缩文件格式是高效数据存储和传输的基础，但其在表示学习方面的潜力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 利用压缩文件的字节流结构设计标记化和编码策略，通过紧凑编码使标准transformer直接学习压缩数据流的语义表示。

Result: 在多样化数据集、编码方案和模态上的实验表明，TEMPEST在保持与最先进方法竞争性准确度的同时，显著减少了语义分类所需的标记数量，降低了计算复杂度和内存使用。

Conclusion: TEMPEST通过利用压缩数据的内在结构，实现了在保持准确性的同时显著提升效率的表示学习方法。

Abstract: Compressed file formats are the corner stone of efficient data storage and
transmission, yet their potential for representation learning remains largely
underexplored. We introduce TEMPEST (TransformErs froM comPressed
rEpreSenTations), a method that exploits the inherent byte-stream structure of
compressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy. By
leveraging this compact encoding, a standard transformer can directly learn
semantic representations from compressed data streams, bypassing the need for
raw byte-level processing or full media decoding. Our proposal substantially
reduces the number of tokens required for semantic classification, thereby
lowering both computational complexity and memory usage. Through extensive
experiments across diverse datasets, coding schemes, and modalities, we show
that TEMPEST achieves accuracy competitive wit the state-of-the-art while
delivering efficiency gains in memory and compute.

TL;DR: 提出了OAT框架，这是一个用于结构拓扑优化的基础模型，能够直接预测任意长宽比、分辨率、体积分数、载荷和固定条件下的最小柔度布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法局限于固定方形网格、少量手动编码的边界条件以及后处理优化，限制了通用部署。需要开发一个能够处理任意边界条件和分辨率的通用框架。

Method: 结合了分辨率无关和形状无关的自编码器、隐式神经场解码器以及条件潜在扩散模型，在包含220万个优化结构的OpenTO数据集上训练。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试和两个具有挑战性的未见测试中，OAT相对于最佳先前模型将平均柔度降低了90%，在单个GPU上实现亚秒级推理，支持从64x64到256x256的分辨率和高达10:1的长宽比。

Conclusion: OAT为物理感知拓扑优化建立了一个通用、快速且分辨率无关的框架，并提供了大规模数据集以促进逆向设计中生成建模的进一步研究。

Abstract: Structural topology optimization (TO) is central to engineering design but
remains computationally intensive due to complex physics and hard constraints.
Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few
hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general
deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model
framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary
aspect ratios, resolutions, volume fractions, loads, and fixtures. OAT combines
a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field
decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new
corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique
boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two
challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the
best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across
resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These
results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for
physics-aware topology optimization and provide a large-scale dataset to spur
further research in generative modeling for inverse design. Code & data can be

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于STL分解的混合预测框架，结合LSTM、ARIMA和XGBoost三种模型分别处理交通流量的趋势、季节性和残差分量，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一模型难以捕捉交通流量数据中复杂的非线性、多尺度时间模式，需要更有效的混合方法来提高预测准确性。

Method: 使用STL将时间序列分解为趋势、季节性和残差三个分量，分别用LSTM建模长期趋势、ARIMA捕捉季节性周期、XGBoost预测非线性残差波动，最后通过乘法集成得到最终预测。

Result: 在纽约市交叉口的998条交通流量记录上测试，LSTM-ARIMA-XGBoost混合模型在MAE、RMSE和R平方指标上显著优于单独的LSTM、ARIMA和XGBoost模型。

Conclusion: 分解策略有效分离了时间特征，使各模型能够专注于特定分量，从而提高了预测精度、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation
systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often
fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in
traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework
that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three
complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series
into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The
final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model
predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection
between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost
hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA,
and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy
effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to
specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and
robustness.

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现MoE模型与密集网络在机制上存在根本差异，网络稀疏性（活跃专家比例）是理解MoE的关键因素，高网络稀疏性导致更高的单义性，专家会围绕连贯特征组合自然组织。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解MoE模型与密集网络在机制上的差异，探索MoE模型的工作机制，特别是专家如何表示特征以及网络稀疏性对模型行为的影响。

Method: 开发了新的度量标准来测量专家间的叠加现象，分析了特征稀疏性、特征重要性和网络稀疏性对MoE模型行为的影响，提出了基于单义性特征表示的专家专业化新定义。

Result: 发现网络稀疏性（而非特征稀疏性或重要性）能更好表征MoE模型，高网络稀疏性导致更高的单义性，专家会围绕连贯特征组合自然组织。

Conclusion: MoE模型中的网络稀疏性可能在不牺牲性能的情况下实现更可解释的模型，挑战了可解释性与能力之间存在根本冲突的常见假设。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have become central to scaling large language
models, yet their mechanistic differences from dense networks remain poorly
understood. Previous work has explored how dense models use
\textit{superposition} to represent more features than dimensions, and how
superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance. MoE
models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens. We find that
neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase
changes, and that network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts)
better characterizes MoEs. We develop new metrics for measuring superposition
across experts. Our findings demonstrate that models with greater network
sparsity exhibit greater \emph{monosemanticity}. We propose a new definition of
expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than
load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature
combinations when initialized appropriately. These results suggest that network
sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing
performance, challenging the common assumption that interpretability and
capability are fundamentally at odds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MSE损失函数有时无法准确捕捉预测范围内的季节性模式或趋势，即使在前向传播中使用分解模块分别建模趋势和季节性。

Method: 使用指数移动平均将时间序列分解为季节性和趋势分量，在预测范围内分别计算这两个分量的损失，然后进行加权组合。

Result: 大量实验表明，DBLoss显著提升了最先进模型在多样化真实世界数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: DBLoss为时间序列损失函数设计提供了新的视角，作为一种通用损失函数可以与任何深度学习预测模型结合使用。

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant value in various domains such as
economics, traffic, energy, and AIOps, as accurate predictions facilitate
informed decision-making. However, the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
function sometimes fails to accurately capture the seasonality or trend within
the forecasting horizon, even when decomposition modules are used in the
forward propagation to model the trend and seasonality separately. To address
these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss
function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to
decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the
forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components
separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can
be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new
perspective on the design of time series loss functions.

Motivation: 传统基于(准)随机设计的初始化方法忽略了两个关键因素：(a)空间填充设计可能不利于减少预测不确定性；(b)高效的超参数学习可能与空间填充设计冲突。

Method: 使用信息论原理推导出HIPE的闭式表达式，在Gaussian Process设置中平衡预测不确定性减少与超参数学习。

Result: 在主动学习和少样本贝叶斯优化实验中，HIPE在预测精度、超参数识别和后续优化性能方面优于标准初始化策略。

Conclusion: HIPE特别适用于大规模批次、少样本的贝叶斯优化应用场景，能显著提升初始化质量。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is a widely used method for optimizing expensive
black-box functions, relying on probabilistic surrogate models such as Gaussian
Processes. The quality of the surrogate model is crucial for good optimization
performance, especially in the few-shot setting where only a small number of
batches of points can be evaluated. In this setting, the initialization plays a
critical role in shaping the surrogate's predictive quality and guiding
subsequent optimization. Despite this, practitioners typically rely on
(quasi-)random designs to cover the input space. However, such approaches
neglect two key factors: (a) space-filling designs may not be desirable to
reduce predictive uncertainty, and (b) efficient hyperparameter learning during
initialization is essential for high-quality prediction, which may conflict
with space-filling designs. To address these limitations, we propose
Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), a novel acquisition
strategy that balances predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter
learning using information-theoretic principles. We derive a closed-form
expression for HIPE in the Gaussian Process setting and demonstrate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments in active learning and few-shot BO.
Our results show that HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in
terms of predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and subsequent
optimization performance, particularly in large-batch, few-shot settings
relevant to many real-world Bayesian Optimization applications.

Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自主决策代理在高风险领域部署存在风险，仅依赖提示工程会导致灾难性脆弱性，需要架构层面的安全保障。

Method: 提出Chimera架构，包含三个互补组件：LLM策略师、形式验证符号约束引擎和用于反事实推理的因果推理模块。

Result: 在52周电商模拟中，Chimera实现最高收益（152万和196万美元），提升品牌信任度（+1.8%和+10.8%），而纯LLM代理造成灾难性损失（9.9万美元）或品牌信任下降（-48.6%）。

Conclusion: 架构设计而非提示工程决定了自主代理在生产环境中的可靠性，Chimera展示了在复杂环境中实现稳健决策的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without
architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness:
identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on
prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that
integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally
verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for
counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures
(LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a
realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics,
and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin
optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in
volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding
symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's
profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M
respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and
+10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+
formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios.
These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering
determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We
provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for
reproducibility.

Motivation: 混沌系统的非线性特性导致对初始条件极度敏感和复杂的动态行为，传统方法难以同时捕捉时间序列的局部特征和全局依赖关系。

Result: 在Lorenz系统的两个代表性任务中，该混合框架始终优于单分支架构，证明了其在混沌系统预测中的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的Transformer-BiLSTM混合框架能够有效解决混沌系统预测中局部特征和全局依赖关系的平衡问题，为复杂动态系统建模提供了有力工具。

Abstract: The nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to
initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors, posing fundamental
challenges for accurately predicting their evolution. To overcome the
limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and
global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes
a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch
architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range
dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal
features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in
a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As
illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on
two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous
evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system
trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate
long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of
unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from
the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its
state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the
proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across
tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system
prediction.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在需要跨模态识别相关线索并进行语用推理的复杂任务（如讽刺检测）中表现不佳，因此需要专门的基准来探索这些局限性。

Method: 引入MUStReason诊断基准，包含模态特定相关线索和推理步骤标注；提出PragCoT框架，将问题分解为感知和推理，引导模型关注隐含意图。

Conclusion: MUStReason基准和PragCoT框架有助于评估和改进视频语言模型在讽刺检测等需要语用推理的复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a specific type of irony which involves discerning what is said
from what is meant. Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content
of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial
expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models
struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying
relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer
the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce
MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of
modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify
sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification
performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception
and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on
implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.

what they have previously learned. In prior work, we introduced Cobweb/4V, a
hierarchical concept formation model that exhibited robustness to catastrophic
forgetting in visual domains. Motivated by this robustness, we examine three
hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to such stability: (1)
adaptive structural reorganization enhances knowledge retention, (2) sparse and
selective updates reduce interference, and (3) information-theoretic learning
based on sufficiency statistics provides advantages over gradient-based
backpropagation. To test these hypotheses, we compare Cobweb/4V with neural
baselines, including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of the Cobweb framework
introduced in this work. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10) show that adaptive restructuring
enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates help mitigate interference, and
the information-theoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without
revisiting past data. Together, these findings provide insight into mechanisms
that can mitigate catastrophic forgetting and highlight the potential of
concept-based, information-theoretic approaches for building stable and
adaptive continual learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Relaxed Sequence Sampling (RSS)方法，这是一个结合结构预测和进化信息的MCMC框架，用于蛋白质设计，相比现有方法能产生更多可设计结构和更大结构多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的蛋白质设计方法如RSO依赖单路径梯度下降，忽略了序列空间约束，限制了设计的多样性和可设计性。

Method: RSS在连续logit空间中操作，结合梯度引导探索和蛋白质语言模型引导的跳跃，其能量函数耦合AlphaFold2结构目标和ESM2序列先验。

Result: 在蛋白质结合物设计任务中，RSS比RSO基线产生5倍多的可设计结构和2-3倍的结构多样性，计算成本相同。

Conclusion: RSS是一种高效探索蛋白质设计空间的原理性方法。

Abstract: Protein design using structure prediction models such as AlphaFold2 has shown
remarkable success, but existing approaches like relaxed sequence optimization
(RSO) rely on single-path gradient descent and ignore sequence-space
constraints, limiting diversity and designability. We introduce Relaxed
Sequence Sampling (RSS), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework that
integrates structural and evolutionary information for protein design. RSS
operates in continuous logit space, combining gradient-guided exploration with
protein language model-informed jumps. Its energy function couples
AlphaFold2-derived structural objectives with ESM2-derived sequence priors,
balancing accuracy and biological plausibility. In an in silico protein binder
design task, RSS produces 5$\times$ more designable structures and 2-3$\times$
greater structural diversity than RSO baselines, at equal computational cost.
These results highlight RSS as a principled approach for efficiently exploring
the protein design landscape.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FuXi-ENS是一种基于AI的台风集合预报系统，相比传统ECMWF-ENS在台风物理变量预测和路径预报方面表现更优，但强度预测仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统台风集合预报系统计算成本高且难以充分表征大气非线性特征，需要开发更高效的AI替代方案。

Method: 采用可学习扰动方案生成集合预报，并与ECMWF-ENS系统在2018年90个全球台风上进行系统性对比分析。

Result: FuXi-ENS在台风物理变量预测方面优势明显，路径预报更准确且集合离散度更小，但强度预测仍低于观测值；动力学分析显示其能更好捕捉大尺度环流和暖核结构。

Conclusion: 可学习扰动方案具有提升台风预报技能的潜力，为AI驱动的极端天气集合预报提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly destructive and inherently uncertain
weather systems. Ensemble forecasting helps quantify these uncertainties, yet
traditional systems are constrained by high computational costs and limited
capability to fully represent atmospheric nonlinearity. FuXi-ENS introduces a
learnable perturbation scheme for ensemble generation, representing a novel
AI-based forecasting paradigm. Here, we systematically compare FuXi-ENS with
ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs in 2018, examining their performance in
TC-related physical variables, track and intensity forecasts, and the
associated dynamical and thermodynamical fields. FuXi-ENS demonstrates clear
advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables, and achieves more
accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though it still
underestimates intensity relative to observations. Further dynamical and
thermodynamical analyses reveal that FuXi-ENS better captures large-scale
circulation, with moisture turbulent energy more tightly concentrated around
the TC warm core, whereas ECMWF-ENS exhibits a more dispersed distribution.
These findings highlight the potential of learnable perturbations to improve TC
forecasting skill and provide valuable insights for advancing AI-based ensemble
prediction of extreme weather events that have significant societal impacts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个解释音频生成模型潜在空间的框架，通过将稀疏自编码器特征映射到可解释的声学概念（音高、振幅、音色），实现可控操作和生成过程分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器在语言模型中成功提取可解释特征，但在音频生成中面临挑战：音频的密集特性使压缩后语义模糊，且自动特征表征有限。

Method: 在音频自编码器潜在空间上训练稀疏自编码器，然后学习从SAE特征到离散化声学属性的线性映射。

Result: 在连续（DiffRhythm-VAE）和离散（EnCodec、WavTokenizer）音频潜在空间上验证了方法，分析了DiffRhythm文本到音乐模型中音高、音色和响度在生成过程中的演变。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了对音频生成模型的可解释分析，并可扩展到视觉潜在空间生成模型。

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) successfully extract interpretable features
from language models, applying them to audio generation faces unique
challenges: audio's dense nature requires compression that obscures semantic
meaning, and automatic feature characterization remains limited. We propose a
framework for interpreting audio generative models by mapping their latent
representations to human-interpretable acoustic concepts. We train SAEs on
audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to
discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, and timbre). This enables
both controllable manipulation and analysis of the AI music generation process,
revealing how acoustic properties emerge during synthesis. We validate our
approach on continuous (DiffRhythm-VAE) and discrete (EnCodec, WavTokenizer)
audio latent spaces, and analyze DiffRhythm, a state-of-the-art text-to-music
model, to demonstrate how pitch, timbre, and loudness evolve throughout
generation. While our work is only done on audio modality, our framework can be
extended to interpretable analysis of visual latent space generation models.

*Adela DePavia,Vasileios Charisopoulos,Rebecca Willett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Adam等自适应梯度方法对模型泛化的影响，发现Adam存在"丰富性偏差"但受数据旋转影响，提出通过重参数化方法解决此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自适应梯度方法如Adam和Adagrad在机器学习中广泛使用，但它们相对于梯度下降等方法对模型泛化的影响仍不清楚。先前研究表明Adam存在"丰富性偏差"，但该方法对特征空间的正交变换很敏感。

Method: 通过分析Adam对数据旋转的敏感性，并采用最近提出的重参数化方法——对优化目标应用正交变换，使任何一阶方法对数据旋转具有等变性。

Result: 研究发现即使小的数据旋转也会使Adam丧失其丰富性偏差，收敛到比梯度下降更远离贝叶斯最优决策边界的线性决策边界。重参数化方法能够恢复Adam对丰富决策边界的偏好。

Conclusion: Adam的丰富性偏差对数据旋转敏感，但通过重参数化方法可以解决这一问题，使Adam保持对非线性决策边界的偏好优势。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam and Adagrad are widely used in machine
learning, yet their effect on the generalization of learned models -- relative
to methods like gradient descent -- remains poorly understood. Prior work on
binary classification suggests that Adam exhibits a ``richness bias,'' which
can help it learn nonlinear decision boundaries closer to the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary relative to gradient descent. However, the coordinate-wise
preconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to
orthogonal transformations of feature space. We show that this sensitivity can
manifest as a reversal of Adam's competitive advantage: even small rotations of
the underlying data distribution can make Adam forfeit its richness bias and
converge to a linear decision boundary that is farther from the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary than the one learned by gradient descent. To alleviate this
issue, we show that a recently proposed reparameterization method -- which
applies an orthogonal transformation to the optimization objective -- endows
any first-order method with equivariance to data rotations, and we empirically
demonstrate its ability to restore Adam's bias towards rich decision
boundaries.

*Pedro Cortes dos Santos,Matheus Becali Rocha,Renato A Krohling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合SHAP特征重要性和因果分析的双重故障检测框架，用于解决工业过程数据复杂性和模型可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业过程产生的复杂数据给故障检测带来挑战，现有机器学习方法在性能和可解释性方面存在局限，需要开发更透明和可操作的故障检测方法。

Method: 使用SHAP识别关键过程特征，然后应用有向无环图进行因果分析，揭示故障传播机制，结合两种方法提升检测准确性和可解释性。

Result: 该方法显著提高了故障检测精度，因果结构与SHAP发现高度一致，识别出冷却和分离系统等关键过程元素在故障发展中的核心作用。

Conclusion: 这种双重方法将预测能力与因果理解相结合，为复杂制造环境监控提供了强大工具，为更智能、可解释的工业故障检测开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Industrial processes generate complex data that challenge fault detection
systems, often yielding opaque or underwhelming results despite advanced
machine learning techniques. This study tackles such difficulties using the
Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate
dynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts
with standard models revealed limitations in both performance and
interpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By
employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a
more manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process
features driving fault predictions. This reduction in complexity unlocks the
ability to apply causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs, generated by
multiple algorithms, to uncover the underlying mechanisms of fault propagation.
The resulting causal structures align strikingly with SHAP findings,
consistently highlighting key process elements-like cooling and separation
systems-as pivotal to fault development. Together, these methods not only
enhance detection accuracy but also provide operators with clear, actionable
insights into fault origins, a synergy that, to our knowledge, has not been
previously explored in this context. This dual approach bridges predictive
power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex
manufacturing environments and paving the way for smarter, more interpretable
fault detection in industrial systems.

*Yilang Zhang,Xiaodong Yang,Yiwei Cai,Georgios B. Giannakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过累积连续低秩增量来构建高秩权重更新的方法，以解决LoRA在效果和收敛速度方面的限制，在多个任务上实现了优于现有LoRA变体的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模扩大，计算开销成为任务特定微调的主要瓶颈。虽然LoRA通过将权重更新限制在低维子空间有效降低了成本，但这种限制会阻碍效果并减缓收敛速度。

Method: 通过累积连续的低秩增量逐步构建高秩权重更新。识别每个更新的最优低秩矩阵以最小化损失函数并接近全参数微调。通过适当缩放原始低秩矩阵的列来形成最优选择，实现高效无缝优化而无需重启。

Result: 在多达120亿参数的流行LLM上进行广泛数值测试，在自然语言理解、常识推理和数学问题解决等多样化任务上，相比最先进的LoRA变体实现了持续的性能提升和快速收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了LoRA在效果和收敛速度方面的限制，通过累积低秩增量构建高秩更新，在保持计算效率的同时实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale in size, the computational
overhead has become a major bottleneck for task-specific fine-tuning. While
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively curtails this cost by confining the
weight updates to a low-dimensional subspace, such a restriction can hinder
effectiveness and slow convergence. This contribution deals with these
limitations by accumulating progressively a high-rank weight update from
consecutive low-rank increments. Specifically, the per update optimal low-rank
matrix is identified to minimize the loss function and closely approximate full
fine-tuning. To endow efficient and seamless optimization without restarting,
this optimal choice is formed by appropriately scaling the columns of the
original low-rank matrix. Rigorous performance guarantees reveal that the
optimal scaling can be found analytically. Extensive numerical tests with
popular LLMs scaling up to 12 billion parameters demonstrate a consistent
performance gain and fast convergence relative to state-of-the-art LoRA
variants on diverse tasks including natural language understanding, commonsense
reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种物理条件化的潜在扩散模型，用于大气数据的动态降尺度，重点重建高分辨率2米温度场。通过将PDE损失项集成到训练目标中，增强了生成场的物理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散训练虽然已经产生较低的PDE残差，但需要进一步正则化模型并增强生成场的物理合理性。

Method: 基于现有扩散架构，采用残差公式，在训练目标中集成了PDE损失项，该损失通过解码潜在表示在完整分辨率空间中计算，通过有效平流-扩散平衡的有限差分近似来强制物理一致性。

Result: 经验观察表明，使用额外损失进行微调可以进一步正则化模型，并增强生成场的物理合理性。

Conclusion: 物理条件化的潜在扩散模型能够有效提升大气数据动态降尺度的物理一致性，代码已在Github上开源。

Abstract: This work presents a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model tailored for
dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, with a focus on reconstructing
high-resolution 2-m temperature fields. Building upon a pre-existing diffusion
architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we
integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's
training objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel)
space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical
consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective
advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional
diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how
fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and
enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields. The entirety of our
codebase is available on Github, for future reference and development.

*Zhichao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GIFT是一种新的强化学习框架，通过最小化隐式和显式奖励模型之间的差异来对齐LLMs，将复杂的奖励最大化问题转化为简单的MSE损失，具有更快的收敛速度和更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统PPO和GRPO方法直接最大化累积奖励的局限性，以及离线方法如DPO和UNA缺乏探索能力的问题，旨在开发一个既保持在线探索又简化优化的对齐框架。

Method: 结合GRPO的在线多响应生成和归一化、DPO的隐式奖励公式化、UNA的隐式-显式奖励对齐原则，通过联合归一化隐式和显式奖励，将优化问题转化为凸的MSE损失函数。

Result: 在数学基准测试中实现了优越的推理和对齐性能，收敛更快，泛化更好，训练过拟合显著减少，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: GIFT通过将非凸优化问题转化为凸的MSE损失，提供了一个稳定、可微分且保持在线探索能力的LLM对齐框架，在性能和效率上都优于现有方法。

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine
\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning
LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT
minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It
combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and
normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the
implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the
implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term
that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms
the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error
(MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex
optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable
formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy
and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer
hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly
reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and
alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining
computationally efficient.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了电动公交车预测性维护的挑战，为车辆维护提供了有效的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) is crucial for optimizing efficiency and
minimizing downtime of electric buses. While these vehicles provide
environmental benefits, they pose challenges for PdM due to complex electric
transmission and battery systems. Traditional maintenance, often based on
scheduled inspections, struggles to capture anomalies in multi-dimensional
real-time CAN Bus data. This study employs a graph-based feature selection
method to analyze relationships among CAN Bus parameters of electric buses and
investigates the prediction performance of targeted alarms using artificial
intelligence techniques. The raw data collected over two years underwent
extensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. A hybrid
graph-based feature selection tool was developed by combining statistical
filtering (Pearson correlation, Cramer's V, ANOVA F-test) with
optimization-based community detection algorithms (InfoMap, Leiden, Louvain,
Fast Greedy). Machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, and
XGBoost, were optimized through grid and random search with data balancing via
SMOTEEN and binary search-based down-sampling. Model interpretability was
achieved using LIME to identify the features influencing predictions. The
results demonstrate that the developed system effectively predicts vehicle
alarms, enhances feature interpretability, and supports proactive maintenance
strategies aligned with Industry 4.0 principles.

Motivation: 现有MIP方法在回归任务中要么只能处理二元特征，要么在处理大规模连续数据时计算不可行。简单二值化连续特征会牺牲全局最优性并产生过深树。

Result: 在包含二元和连续特征的回归基准测试中，RS-ORT在训练和测试性能上优于现有方法。对于200万样本的连续特征数据集，能在4小时内获得保证的训练性能、更简单的树结构和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RS-ORT通过专门的分支定界设计和多种加速技术，有效解决了大规模连续特征回归树训练的挑战，实现了计算效率和模型性能的平衡。

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for
learning optimal decision trees. Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression
tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally
intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing
continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly
deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage
optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees
(RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches
exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the
algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training
samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound
tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold
discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with
decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training.
The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further
alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets.
Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both
binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and
testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up
to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed
training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization
ability in four hours.

Motivation: 现有因果发现方法主要关注成对因果关系，忽略了变量组（子系统）之间的交互作用和集体因果影响，特别是在非线性多元时间序列中。

Method: 使用深度学习联合建模所有时间序列组的结构关系，对训练好的模型应用组级干预，然后进行模型不变性测试来确定变量组间是否存在因果链接。

Abstract: Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing
predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially
in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily
focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among
groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In
this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method
that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and
employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach
involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the
structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply
group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model
invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable
groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its
superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world
datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results
highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models,
combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal
structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and
climate science.

Motivation: 当前LLM中的注意力机制使用Query、Key、Value权重三元组，但理论上可能存在冗余，希望通过简化结构来减少参数数量。

Method: 在理论分析基础上，在完整的GPT-3小架构（包含层归一化、跳跃连接和权重衰减）上训练验证，比较标准模型与移除Query权重的简化模型。

Result: 简化模型在验证损失上达到与标准基线相当的水平，证明Query权重确实是冗余的。

Conclusion: Query权重在注意力机制中是冗余的，这一发现在大规模模型上值得进一步研究验证。

Abstract: The Query, Key, Value weight triplet is a building block of current attention
mechanisms in state-of-the-art LLMs. We theoretically investigate whether this
triplet can be reduced, proving under simplifying assumptions that the Query
weights are redundant, thereby reducing the number of non-embedding/lm-head
parameters by over 8%. We validate the theory on full-complexity GPT-3 small
architectures (with layer normalization, skip connections, and weight decay)
trained from scratch, demonstrating that the reduced model achieves comparable
validation loss to standard baselines. These findings motivate the
investigation of the Query weight redundancy at scale.

Method: 将折扣回报MDP的几何解释扩展到平均回报情况，建立统一的几何分析框架。

Result: 成功将折扣回报情况下的主要结果扩展到平均回报情况：在唯一且遍历的最优策略下，值迭代算法具有几何收敛率。

Conclusion: 通过几何解释的统一框架，实现了平均回报和折扣回报MDP分析的统一，并证明了值迭代算法在两种情况下都具有几何收敛特性。

Abstract: The theoretical analysis of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is commonly
split into two cases - the average-reward case and the discounted-reward case -
which, while sharing similarities, are typically analyzed separately. In this
work, we extend a recently introduced geometric interpretation of MDPs for the
discounted-reward case to the average-reward case, thereby unifying both. This
allows us to extend a major result known for the discounted-reward case to the
average-reward case: under a unique and ergodic optimal policy, the Value
Iteration algorithm achieves a geometric convergence rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STE提供高质量但有偏的梯度，ZO梯度无偏但计算昂贵，需要一种方法能减少STE偏差同时降低ZO方法的计算量

Method: FOGZO（一阶引导的零阶梯度下降），结合STE的高质量梯度和ZO梯度的无偏特性

Result: 相比STE，在相同迭代次数下：DeiT Tiny/Small准确率提升1-8%，ResNet 18/50提升1-2%，LLaMA模型困惑度提升1-22点；相比n-SPSA，在相同损失下计算量减少796倍

Conclusion: FOGZO在量化感知预训练中有效改善了质量与训练时间之间的权衡

Abstract: We study the problem of training neural networks with quantized parameters.
Learning low-precision quantized parameters by enabling computation of
gradients via the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) can be challenging. While
the STE enables back-propagation, which is a first-order method, recent works
have explored the use of zeroth-order (ZO) gradient descent for fine-tuning. We
note that the STE provides high-quality biased gradients, and ZO gradients are
unbiased but can be expensive. We thus propose First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order
Gradient Descent (FOGZO) that reduces STE bias while reducing computations
relative to ZO methods. Empirically, we show FOGZO improves the tradeoff
between quality and training time in Quantization-Aware Pre-Training.
Specifically, versus STE at the same number of iterations, we show a 1-8\%
accuracy improvement for DeiT Tiny/Small, 1-2\% accuracy improvement on ResNet
18/50, and 1-22 perplexity point improvement for LLaMA models with up to 0.3
billion parameters. For the same loss, FOGZO yields a 796$\times$ reduction in
computation versus n-SPSA for a 2-layer MLP on MNIST. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了差分隐私机制（DP-SGD和PDP-SGD）作为联邦学习中梯度泄漏攻击防御措施的有效性，发现DP-SGD能显著降低攻击风险但会影响模型性能，而PDP-SGD保持良好性能但防御效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能在不共享敏感数据的情况下协作训练模型，但仍易受梯度泄漏攻击的威胁，需要评估差分隐私机制的实际防御效果。

Method: 在模拟联邦学习环境中，使用不同隐私级别训练多个计算机视觉模型进行简单分类任务，然后分析从截获梯度中重建私有数据的质量。

Result: DP-SGD显著减轻了梯度泄漏攻击风险，但以模型效用适度下降为代价；PDP-SGD保持了强大的分类性能，但对重建攻击的防御效果不佳。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在分布式学习场景中，除了理论保证外，还需要实证评估隐私机制的重要性，因为信息泄露可能对数据安全和隐私构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in
a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it
remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private
information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD
and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against
GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision
models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task,
and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the
intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate
that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks,
albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD
maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a
practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the
importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their
theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where
information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data
security and privacy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需数据的神经网络算子，用于Navier-Stokes方程求解，消除了配对解数据的需求，实现了鲁棒的实时推理和大规模集合预报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维流动模型的集合模拟计算成本过高，而现有神经算子需要大量数据且难以推广到3D流动。需要开发无需数据的方法来实现实时应用。

Method: 采用基于物理的架构，直接输入初始条件、边界条件和强制函数，无需配对解数据，构建数据自由的算子网络。

Result: 在2D基准测试和3D测试案例中，该方法在精度上超越现有神经算子，对于集合预报比传统数值求解器更高效，首次实现了3D Navier-Stokes方程的准确求解。

Conclusion: 通过将数值基础架构与机器学习可扩展性相结合，为端到端科学模拟和预测建立了实用的数据自由高保真PDE替代模型路径。

Abstract: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models (e.g., Navier Stokes
type PDEs) are computationally prohibitive for real time applications. Neural
operators enable fast inference but are limited by costly data requirements and
poor generalization to 3D flows. We present a data-free operator network for
the Navier Stokes equations that eliminates the need for paired solution data
and enables robust, real time inference for large ensemble forecasting. The
physics-grounded architecture takes initial and boundary conditions as well as
forcing functions, yielding solutions robust to high variability and
perturbations. Across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, the method surpasses
prior neural operators in accuracy and, for ensembles, achieves greater
efficiency than conventional numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers accurate
solutions of the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations, a regime not
previously demonstrated for data free neural operators. By uniting a
numerically grounded architecture with the scalability of machine learning,
this approach establishes a practical pathway toward data free, high fidelity
PDE surrogates for end to end scientific simulation and prediction.

Abstract: In this work, a three-dimensional multicomponent reaction-diffusion model has
been developed, combining excitable-system dynamics with diffusion processes
and sharing conceptual features with the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Designed to
capture the spatiotemporal behavior of biological systems, particularly
electrophysiological processes, the model was solved numerically to generate
time-series data. These data were subsequently used to train and evaluate an
Echo State Network (ESN), which successfully reproduced the system's dynamic
behavior. The results demonstrate that simulating biological dynamics using
data-driven, multifunctional ESN models is both feasible and effective.

TL;DR: 提出了ChessQA基准测试，用于全面评估LLM在国际象棋中的理解能力，涵盖从基础规则到高级概念的五个任务类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法零散且范围狭窄，难以准确衡量LLM在国际象棋中的理解能力及其随规模、训练方法和架构的变化。

Method: 创建包含五个任务类别（结构、模式、短战术、局面判断和语义）的基准测试，对应棋手知识积累的抽象层次。

Result: 评估当代LLM发现所有五个类别都存在持续弱点，并提供按类别的结果和错误分析。

Conclusion: ChessQA提供了更全面的象棋能力评估，超越了简单的走子质量评估，为诊断和比较提供了受控环境。

Abstract: Chess provides an ideal testbed for evaluating the reasoning, modeling, and
abstraction capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it has
well-defined structure and objective ground truth while admitting a wide
spectrum of skill levels. However, existing evaluations of LLM ability in chess
are ad hoc and narrow in scope, making it difficult to accurately measure LLM
chess understanding and how it varies with scale, post-training methodologies,
or architecture choices. We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that
assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural,
Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately
correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate
chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to
correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically
describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more
comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly
beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a
controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore,
ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction
scripts that can evolve as models improve. Evaluating a range of contemporary
LLMs, we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide
results and error analyses by category. We will release the code, periodically
refreshed datasets, and a public leaderboard to support further research.

TL;DR: 提出了测量思维链可监控性的方法，包括可读性和覆盖度两个指标，通过自动评分器提示词实现评估，发现前沿模型在这些指标上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链监控为AI安全提供了独特机会，但训练实践或模型架构的变化可能削弱这种可监控性，需要建立测量方法来保持监控能力。

Method: 使用自动评分器提示词来评估思维链的可读性（人类能否理解推理过程）和覆盖度（是否包含足够信息让人类也能得出最终输出）。

Result: 在合成思维链退化测试中验证了自动评分器的有效性，应用于前沿模型发现它们表现出高可监控性。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发者提供了跟踪设计决策对可监控性影响的工具，是对抗性压力测试的补充而非替代。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring offers a unique opportunity for AI
safety, this opportunity could be lost through shifts in training practices or
model architecture. To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way
to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be
followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning
needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these
metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the
legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted
autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier
models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high
monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater
prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact
monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version
under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in
the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default
monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement,
for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against
deliberately evasive models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到图像扩散模型使用固定的文本嵌入，无法适应生成过程中的动态变化，限制了文本条件与生成图像的匹配度。

Method: 通过优化问题推导更新规则，在每个采样步骤中基于中间扰动数据动态细化文本嵌入，使文本条件能够适应反向扩散过程。

Result: DATE在保持模型生成能力的同时，在多概念生成和文本引导图像编辑等任务中显著优于固定文本嵌入方法。

Conclusion: DATE提供了一种无需额外训练的动态文本嵌入适应机制，有效提升了扩散模型中文本-图像对齐的质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on text embeddings from a pre-trained
text encoder, but these embeddings remain fixed across all diffusion timesteps,
limiting their adaptability to the generative process. We propose Diffusion
Adaptive Text Embedding (DATE), which dynamically updates text embeddings at
each diffusion timestep based on intermediate perturbed data. We formulate an
optimization problem and derive an update rule that refines the text embeddings
at each sampling step to improve alignment and preference between the mean
predicted image and the text. This allows DATE to dynamically adapts the text
conditions to the reverse-diffused images throughout diffusion sampling without
requiring additional model training. Through theoretical analysis and empirical
results, we show that DATE maintains the generative capability of the model
while providing superior text-image alignment over fixed text embeddings across
various tasks, including multi-concept generation and text-guided image
editing. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DATE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型往往低估罕见但危险的污染事件，而准确预测PM浓度对于及时发布公共卫生预警至关重要。

Method: 基于区域适应的transformer架构，结合扩散式随机细化模块，利用ERA5和CAMS数据集，采用领域感知目标和极值理论指导训练。

Result: 在多个PM变量（PM1、PM2.5、PM10）预测上表现显著提升，特别是在极端条件下，且不损害全局准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为下一代空气质量预警系统提供了可扩展基础，支持脆弱地区的气候健康风险缓解。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk,
particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to
wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate
matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings
and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous
pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural
forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to
improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a
regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based
stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving
PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized
ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting
fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),
especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss
functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show
that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory,
significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without
compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for
next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health
risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

Result: 大量实验表明STNet持续优于现有学习方法，在精度上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: STNet通过谱变换有效解决了算子特征值问题的维度灾难，显著提升了学习方法的性能。

Abstract: Operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific
fields and engineering applications, yet numerical methods are hindered by the
curse of dimensionality. Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient
approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks.
These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the
given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve
precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral
distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we
propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration,
STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral
transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but
easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the
subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the
search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally,
our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses
those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time estimation of barge quantity on inland waterways remains
a critical challenge due to the non-self-propelled nature of barges and the
limitations of existing monitoring systems. This study introduces a novel
method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to
predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and
test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes
across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel
tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30
AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and
trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression
models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches,
were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best
performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of
the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics
capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and
trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides
a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain
Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port
management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept
presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with
differing operational and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have recently made significant advances in generating
realistic and semantically coherent images, driven by advanced diffusion models
and large-scale web-crawled datasets. However, these datasets often contain
inappropriate or biased content, raising concerns about the generation of
harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts. We propose Safe Text
embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of
diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts
the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final
denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional
training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model
distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while
minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety
scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG
consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in
removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input
prompts. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/STG.

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of
great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis
of neurological diseases. Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing
the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific
functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level
trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic
behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on
medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we
extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional
partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the
model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods
in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph
learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical
applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种全局-局部融合采样策略（GLF），通过结合全局和局部采样的优势，在保持稳定性的同时提高PINNs的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs的准确性严重依赖于配置点的放置。全局采样覆盖整个域但计算成本高，局部采样效率高但可能忽略已学习好的区域。需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 使用高斯噪声扰动训练点，噪声大小与残差成反比，从而在困难区域集中采样。引入轻量级线性代理模型来近似全局残差分布，降低计算开销。

Result: 在基准PDE上的广泛实验表明，GLF相比全局和局部采样策略，在准确性和效率方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: GLF为增强PINNs在解决复杂高维PDE中的可靠性和效率提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: The accuracy of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) critically depends
on the placement of collocation points, as the PDE loss is approximated through
sampling over the solution domain. Global sampling ensures stability by
covering the entire domain but requires many samples and is computationally
expensive, whereas local sampling improves efficiency by focusing on
high-residual regions but may neglect well-learned areas, reducing robustness.
We propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) Sampling Strategy that combines the
strengths of both approaches. Specifically, new collocation points are
generated by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to
the residual, thereby concentrating samples in difficult regions while
preserving exploration. To further reduce computational overhead, a lightweight
linear surrogate is introduced to approximate the global residual-based
distribution, achieving similar effectiveness at a fraction of the cost.
Together, these components, residual-adaptive sampling and residual-based
approximation, preserve the stability of global methods while retaining the
efficiency of local refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs
demonstrate that GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency
compared with global and local sampling strategies. This study provides a
practical and scalable framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency
of PINNs in solving complex and high-dimensional PDEs.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Multivariate time series Forecast (STMF) uses the time series
of $n$ spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast
their values in a period of near future. It has important applications in
spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air
pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of
missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications
where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to
be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art
assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model
input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$
variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by
studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects
$m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast
accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable
selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model
efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked
variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative
variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2)
prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to
preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation
mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input
to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency
information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and

Abstract: We introduce GraphNet, a dataset of 2.7K real-world deep learning
computational graphs with rich metadata, spanning six major task categories
across multiple deep learning frameworks. To evaluate tensor compiler
performance on these samples, we propose the benchmark metric Speedup Score
S(t), which jointly considers runtime speedup and execution correctness under
tunable tolerance levels, offering a reliable measure of general optimization
capability. Furthermore, we extend S(t) to the Error-aware Speedup Score ES(t),
which incorporates error information and helps compiler developers identify key
performance bottlenecks. In this report, we benchmark the default tensor
compilers, CINN for PaddlePaddle and TorchInductor for PyTorch, on computer
vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) samples to demonstrate the
practicality of GraphNet. The full construction pipeline with graph extraction

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an
emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In
this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with
discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that
enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural
networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on
convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network
outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to
feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised
training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural
net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in
cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently
outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our
method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set
of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in
graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-Stage LKPLO是一个新颖的多阶段异常检测框架，通过结合广义损失函数、全局核PCA和局部聚类，克服了传统投影方法的局限性，在复杂数据结构上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基于投影的异常检测方法对固定统计度量的依赖和单一数据结构假设的局限性。

Method: 提出三阶段方法：1) 广义损失函数(PLO)替代固定度量；2) 全局核PCA线性化非线性结构；3) 局部聚类处理多模态分布。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上的5折交叉验证显示，Two-Stage LKPLO在具有挑战性结构的数据集上显著优于基线方法，特别是在多聚类数据和复杂高维数据上表现突出。

Conclusion: 该工作为重要类别的异常检测问题提供了强大工具，并强调了混合多阶段架构的重要性。

Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection
framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional
projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and
their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes
three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO)
that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our
proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear
data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle
multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on
10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate
that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly
outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where
existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and
complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study
empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization
and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This
work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier
detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage
architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过因果解耦学习来减少无监督域自适应中负迁移的方法RED，通过分离因果特征和环境特征来降低环境分歧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督域自适应中由于显著域偏移导致的负迁移问题，特别是跨域在非因果环境特征上的判别分歧。

Method: 提出RED方法，通过对抗训练域特定的环境特征提取器，将样本解耦为域不变的因果特征和域特定的非因果环境特征，然后估计并减少环境分歧。

Result: 实验结果表明RED有效缓解了负迁移问题，并取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过因果解耦学习减少环境分歧是解决无监督域自适应中负迁移问题的有效途径。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation~(UDA) focuses on transferring knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, addressing the challenge
of \emph{domain shift}. Significant domain shifts hinder effective knowledge
transfer, leading to \emph{negative transfer} and deteriorating model
performance. Therefore, mitigating negative transfer is essential. This study
revisits negative transfer through the lens of causally disentangled learning,
emphasizing cross-domain discriminative disagreement on non-causal
environmental features as a critical factor. Our theoretical analysis reveals
that overreliance on non-causal environmental features as the environment
evolves can cause discriminative disagreements~(termed \emph{environmental
disagreement}), thereby resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we
propose Reducing Environmental Disagreement~(RED), which disentangles each
sample into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal
environmental features via adversarially training domain-specific environmental
feature extractors in the opposite domains. Subsequently, RED estimates and
reduces environmental disagreement based on domain-specific non-causal
environmental features. Experimental results confirm that RED effectively
mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有表格数据生成方法（特别是基于GAN的方法）在捕捉复杂因果关系、保持数据效用和提供可证明的隐私保证方面存在不足，限制了在真实企业环境中的应用。

Method: 采用两步法：1）因果图提取学习数据流形中的因果关系；2）基于因果图结构的条件WGAN-GP，结合强化学习目标确保真实和生成数据的因果图对齐。

Result: 在14个表格数据集上优于6种最先进方法，在因果保持、效用保持和隐私保持三个核心数据工程指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: CA-GAN为数据工程师提供了一个实用、高性能的解决方案，能够创建高质量、符合隐私要求的合成数据集，用于数据库系统基准测试、软件开发加速和安全数据驱动研究。

Abstract: The utility of tabular data for tasks ranging from model training to
large-scale data analysis is often constrained by privacy concerns or
regulatory hurdles. While existing data generation methods, particularly those
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise, they
frequently struggle with capturing complex causal relationship, maintaining
data utility, and providing provable privacy guarantees suitable for enterprise
deployment. We introduce CA-GAN, a novel generative framework specifically
engineered to address these challenges for real-world tabular datasets. CA-GAN
utilizes a two-step approach: causal graph extraction to learn a robust,
comprehensive causal relationship in the data's manifold, followed by a custom
Conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty) that operates
exclusively as per the structure of nodes in the causal graph. More
importantly, the generator is trained with a new Reinforcement Learning-based
objective that aligns the causal graphs constructed from real and fake data,
ensuring the causal awareness in both training and sampling phases. We
demonstrate CA-GAN superiority over six SOTA methods across 14 tabular
datasets. Our evaluations, focused on core data engineering metrics: causal
preservation, utility preservation, and privacy preservation. Our method offers
a practical, high-performance solution for data engineers seeking to create
high-quality, privacy-compliant synthetic datasets to benchmark database
systems, accelerate software development, and facilitate secure data-driven
research.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在长期自回归预测中误差累积导致物理不合理的问题，弥补纯参数化方法难以完全捕捉系统内在动力学约束的缺陷

Method: RAP框架：检索最相似历史演化样本作为参考目标，通过双流架构将其作为条件输入提供动态指导，而非硬约束损失函数

Conclusion: RAP框架成功结合参数化和非参数化方法的优势，生成更物理合理的预测，为复杂物理系统的长期时空预测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Accurate and long-term spatiotemporal prediction for complex physical systems
remains a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. While deep learning
models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success,
they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during
long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible
artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which
struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To
address this, we introduce a novel \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction
(RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of
deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy
of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric
estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently
retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The
true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \textbf{reference
target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function
but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream
architecture. It provides strong \textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the
model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive
benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only
surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong
\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}. More importantly, RAP generates
predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error
divergence in long-term rollouts.

Motivation: 传统蛋白质优化方法成本高昂，现有ALDE方法在每轮选择最高预测突变体时会产生同质化训练数据，导致后续预测模型不准确

Method: FolDE采用自然性预热启动（利用蛋白质语言模型输出来增强有限活性测量）和恒定谎言批量选择器（提高批量多样性）

Result: 在20个蛋白质靶点的模拟中，FolDE比最佳基线ALDE方法多发现23%的前10%突变体，找到前1%突变体的可能性高55%

Conclusion: FolDE通过改进的预热启动和批量选择策略，显著提高了蛋白质定向进化的效率，为实验室提供了高效蛋白质优化的开源工具

Abstract: Proteins are traditionally optimized through the costly construction and
measurement of many mutants. Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE)
alleviates that cost by predicting the best improvements and iteratively
testing mutants to inform predictions. However, existing ALDE methods face a
critical limitation: selecting the highest-predicted mutants in each round
yields homogeneous training data insufficient for accurate prediction models in
subsequent rounds. Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize
end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE
discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005)
and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily
through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity
measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity
prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves
batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited
effect in our benchmarks. The complete workflow is freely available as
open-source software, making efficient protein optimization accessible to any
laboratory.

TL;DR: FALQON是一个消除FP8量化LoRA微调开销的框架，通过将LoRA适配器直接合并到FP8量化的主干网络中，实现约3倍训练加速，同时保持相似精度水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP8量化虽然能加速大维度矩阵乘法，但在LoRA微调中由于小维度矩阵的量化开销而效果有限，需要解决量化开销问题以实现高效微调。

Method: 提出FALQON框架：1) 将LoRA适配器直接合并到FP8量化主干中；2) 重新设计前向和反向计算以减少量化开销；3) 引入行级代理更新机制高效整合大更新到量化主干。

Result: 实验评估显示FALQON相比现有量化LoRA方法实现约3倍训练加速，精度水平相似，并提供端到端FP8工作流，无需后训练量化。

Conclusion: FALQON为大规模模型高效微调提供了实用解决方案，通过消除量化开销显著提升训练效率，并简化部署流程。

Abstract: Low-bit floating-point (FP) formats, such as FP8, provide significant
acceleration and memory savings in model training thanks to native hardware
support on modern GPUs and NPUs. However, we analyze that FP8 quantization
offers speedup primarily for large-dimensional matrix multiplications, while
inherent quantization overheads diminish speedup when applied to low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which uses small-dimensional matrices for efficient
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). To address this limitation, we
propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead
from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into
an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the
forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce
quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that
efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a
3$\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar
level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale
model fine-tuning. Moreover, FALQON's end-to-end FP8 workflow removes the need
for post-training quantization, facilitating efficient deployment. Code is

Conclusion: 该框架为离散扩散模型提供了理论基础，证明了常用损失函数的理论合理性，并提供了实用的似然估计方法。

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models
that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching
losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive
analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the
Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links
mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum
denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion
and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE)
relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete
masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the
log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that
commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but
tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition
further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional
likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo
estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data
confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dongjae0324/infodis.

Abstract: We present DEPS, an end-to-end algorithm for discovering parameterized skills
from expert demonstrations. Our method learns parameterized skill policies
jointly with a meta-policy that selects the appropriate discrete skill and
continuous parameters at each timestep. Using a combination of temporal
variational inference and information-theoretic regularization methods, we
address the challenge of degeneracy common in latent variable models, ensuring
that the learned skills are temporally extended, semantically meaningful, and
adaptable. We empirically show that learning parameterized skills from
multitask expert demonstrations significantly improves generalization to unseen
tasks. Our method outperforms multitask as well as skill learning baselines on
both LIBERO and MetaWorld benchmarks. We also demonstrate that DEPS discovers
interpretable parameterized skills, such as an object grasping skill whose
continuous arguments define the grasp location.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于图的RAG方法在构建知识图谱时需要大量LLM调用来提取实体和关系，导致高昂的成本，特别是在大规模应用中。

Method: G2ConS包含两个核心组件：块选择方法选择重要文档块以减少KG构建成本；LLM无关的概念图以零成本填补由块选择引入的知识空白。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的评估显示，G2ConS在构建成本、检索效果和回答质量方面均优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: G2ConS通过智能概念选择和概念图构建，有效解决了图基RAG系统的高成本问题，同时保持了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Graph-based RAG constructs a knowledge graph (KG) from text chunks to enhance
retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is
especially beneficial in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political
science, where effective retrieval often involves multi-hop reasoning over
proprietary documents. However, these methods demand numerous LLM calls to
extract entities and relations from text chunks, incurring prohibitive costs at
scale. Through a carefully designed ablation study, we observe that certain
words (termed concepts) and their associated documents are more important.
Based on this insight, we propose Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS). Its
core comprises a chunk selection method and an LLM-independent concept graph.
The former selects salient document chunks to reduce KG construction costs; the
latter closes knowledge gaps introduced by chunk selection at zero cost.
Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets show that G2ConS outperforms all
baselines in construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and answering quality.

Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of Causal Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) with quasi-linear activation functions when applied to time-series data
characterized by multimodal frequency content. We demonstrate that, once
trained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response
(FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended
length exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal
CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly,
offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems.
Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the
entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling
an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new
insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with
sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam
dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance
for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of electric vehicles has intensified the need for
accurate and efficient diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries. Parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models is widely recognized as a
powerful method for battery health assessment. However, conventional
metaheuristic approaches suffer from high computational cost and slow
convergence, and recent machine learning methods are limited by their reliance
on constant current data, which may not be available in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose deep learning-based framework for parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models. The proposed framework
combines a neural surrogate model of the single particle model with electrolyte
(NeuralSPMe) and a deep learning-based fixed-point iteration method. NeuralSPMe
is trained on realistic EV load profiles to accurately predict lithium
concentration dynamics under dynamic operating conditions while a parameter
update network (PUNet) performs fixed-point iterative updates to significantly
reduce both the evaluation time per sample and the overall number of iterations
required for convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed framework accelerates the parameter identification by more than 2000
times, achieves superior sample efficiency and more than 10 times higher
accuracy compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms, particularly under
dynamic load scenarios encountered in practical applications.

Conclusion: I-OnsagerNet建立了一个通用的数据驱动框架，用于发现和解释非平衡动力学。

Abstract: Complex dissipative systems appear across science and engineering, from
polymers and active matter to learning algorithms. These systems operate far
from equilibrium, where energy dissipation and time irreversibility are key to
their behavior, but are difficult to quantify from data. Learning accurate and
interpretable models of such dynamics remains a major challenge: the models
must be expressive enough to describe diverse processes, yet constrained enough
to remain physically meaningful and mathematically identifiable. Here, we
introduce I-OnsagerNet, a neural framework that learns dissipative stochastic
dynamics directly from trajectories while ensuring both interpretability and
uniqueness. I-OnsagerNet extends the Onsager principle to guarantee that the
learned potential is obtained from the stationary density and that the drift
decomposes cleanly into time-reversible and time-irreversible components, as
dictated by the Helmholtz decomposition. Our approach enables us to calculate
the entropy production and to quantify irreversibility, offering a principled
way to detect and quantify deviations from equilibrium. Applications to polymer
stretching in elongational flow and to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
reveal new insights, including super-linear scaling of barrier heights and
sub-linear scaling of entropy production rates with the strain rate, and the
suppression of irreversibility with increasing batch size. I-OnsagerNet thus
establishes a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting
non-equilibrium dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了EddyFormer，一种基于Transformer的谱元架构，用于大规模湍流模拟，结合了谱方法的精度和注意力机制的可扩展性，在256^3分辨率下达到DNS精度，速度提升30倍，并展示了领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完全解析大规模湍流的直接数值模拟计算成本过高，需要数据驱动的机器学习替代方案。

Method: 使用Transformer-based谱元架构，引入SEM标记化将流动分解为网格尺度和亚网格尺度分量，能够捕捉局部和全局特征。

Result: 在256^3分辨率下达到DNS精度，速度提升30倍；在比训练域大4倍的未见域中保持物理不变指标的准确性；在The Well基准测试套件中准确再现复杂动力学。

Conclusion: EddyFormer结合了谱方法的精度和Transformer的可扩展性，为大规模湍流模拟提供了高效准确的解决方案，并展示了良好的领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Computationally resolving turbulence remains a central challenge in fluid
dynamics due to its multi-scale interactions. Fully resolving large-scale
turbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally
prohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this
work, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM)
architecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy
of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We
introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and
subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features.
We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train
EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x
speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in
training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy
spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain
generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows,
EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately
reproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions.

TL;DR: V-SAT是一个统一的视频字幕标注框架，通过结合LLM、VLM、图像处理和ASR技术，自动检测和修正多种字幕质量问题，显著提升字幕质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有字幕生成方法存在同步性差、文本错误、格式不一致、阅读速度不当等问题，且通常只解决孤立问题，导致后期编辑工作繁重耗时。

Method: 结合大型语言模型、视觉语言模型、图像处理和自动语音识别技术，利用音频和视频的上下文信息进行字幕质量检测和修正。

Result: 字幕质量显著改善，SUBER分数从9.6降至3.54，图像模式问题的F1分数达到约0.80。

Conclusion: V-SAT提供了首个全面的字幕标注解决方案，通过人机协作确保高质量结果。

Abstract: The surge of audiovisual content on streaming platforms and social media has
heightened the demand for accurate and accessible subtitles. However, existing
subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based
extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization,
incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading
speeds, and the inability to adapt to dynamic audio-visual contexts. Current
approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a
labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT
(Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically
detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining
Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing,
and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from
both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced
from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of
~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality
results, providing the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle
annotation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEAR++攻击改进了原有的SPEAR梯度反演攻击，通过应用稀疏字典学习技术，使线性层与ReLU激活的梯度反演问题变得可处理，将适用批次大小提升了10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然实现了分布式训练而不共享数据，但梯度反演攻击挑战了其隐私保护特性。现有攻击缺乏形式化保证且效率低下，特别是SPEAR攻击在批次大小上呈指数级复杂度，限制了实用性。

Method: 应用最先进的稀疏字典学习技术来解决线性层与ReLU激活的梯度反演问题，使原本指数复杂度的计算变得可处理。

Result: SPEAR++保留了SPEAR的所有理想特性（如对DP噪声和FedAvg聚合的鲁棒性），同时能够处理比原来大10倍的批次大小。

Conclusion: SPEAR++显著提升了梯度反演攻击的实用性，使得对现实世界联邦学习系统的隐私风险评估更加可行。

Abstract: Federated Learning has seen an increased deployment in real-world scenarios
recently, as it enables the distributed training of machine learning models
without explicit data sharing between individual clients. Yet, the introduction
of the so-called gradient inversion attacks has fundamentally challenged its
privacy-preserving properties. Unfortunately, as these attacks mostly rely on
direct data optimization without any formal guarantees, the vulnerability of
real-world systems remains in dispute and requires tedious testing for each new
federated deployment. To overcome these issues, recently the SPEAR attack was
introduced, which is based on a theoretical analysis of the gradients of linear
layers with ReLU activations. While SPEAR is an important theoretical
breakthrough, the attack's practicality was severely limited by its exponential
runtime in the batch size b. In this work, we fill this gap by applying
State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to make the
problem of gradient inversion on linear layers with ReLU activations tractable.
Our experiments demonstrate that our new attack, SPEAR++, retains all desirable
properties of SPEAR, such as robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation,
while being applicable to 10x bigger batch sizes.

TL;DR: SPARK是一个物理引导的定量增强插件，通过重构自编码器将物理参数整合到物理丰富的离散状态字典中，在潜在空间进行插值生成物理合理的训练样本，并与傅里叶增强图ODE结合进行下游预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值方法计算成本高，现代数据驱动方法面临数据稀缺和分布偏移问题，需要解决这些根本限制。

Method: 使用重构自编码器创建物理状态字典，在潜在空间进行插值生成新样本，结合傅里叶增强图ODE进行预测建模。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于最先进基线，特别是在分布外场景和数据稀缺情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: 物理引导的增强范式在应对数据稀缺和分布偏移方面具有显著效果，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: In dynamical system modeling, traditional numerical methods are limited by
high computational costs, while modern data-driven approaches struggle with
data scarcity and distribution shifts. To address these fundamental
limitations, we first propose SPARK, a physics-guided quantitative augmentation
plugin. Specifically, SPARK utilizes a reconstruction autoencoder to integrate
physical parameters into a physics-rich discrete state dictionary. This state
dictionary then acts as a structured dictionary of physical states, enabling
the creation of new, physically-plausible training samples via principled
interpolation in the latent space. Further, for downstream prediction, these
augmented representations are seamlessly integrated with a Fourier-enhanced
Graph ODE, a combination designed to robustly model the enriched data
distribution while capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SPARK significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios and data-scarce regimes, proving the efficacy of
our physics-guided augmentation paradigm.

TL;DR: 本文比较了ICU生命体征数据缺失值插补方法，旨在为临床预测模型选择最准确的插补技术，提高医疗预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU数据中存在大量缺失的生命体征测量值，这会影响机器学习预测模型的性能。目前缺乏对代表性插补方法的全面比较，且临床实践中仍在使用可能降低预测准确性的临时插补技术。

Method: 建立了一个可扩展和可重复的基准测试框架，包含15种插补方法和4种截断方法，用于在主要ICU数据集上进行基准测试。

Result: 通过系统比较不同插补技术，为研究人员提供了选择最准确插补方法的指导。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为ICU数据插补提供了比较基础，有助于促进更多机器学习模型进入临床实践。

Abstract: As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in
developing clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols
increases. However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction
using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate,
contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could
negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced
numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive
work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU
vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation
techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are
still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide
researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by
selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible
and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods,
created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a
comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models
into clinical practice.

TL;DR: 提出了PRIVET算法，使用极值统计和最近邻距离来为每个合成数据样本分配个体隐私泄露分数，能可靠检测记忆化和隐私泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度生成模型常训练于敏感数据，现有方法主要依赖全局标准评估隐私风险，缺乏样本级别的严格评估方法，阻碍合成数据在实际应用中的部署。

Method: 基于极值统计和最近邻距离，开发了PRIVET算法，该算法是样本基础、模态无关的，能为每个合成样本分配个体隐私泄露分数。

Result: PRIVET在各种数据模态中可靠检测记忆化和隐私泄露，包括高维设置、小样本遗传数据，甚至在欠拟合情况下也有效。相比现有方法，能提供数据集和样本级别的评估。

Conclusion: PRIVET填补了样本级别隐私评估的空白，为合成数据的实际部署提供了更全面的隐私保护评估工具，同时揭示了现有计算机视觉嵌入在识别近重复样本时的局限性。

Abstract: Deep generative models are often trained on sensitive data, such as genetic
sequences, health data, or more broadly, any copyrighted, licensed or protected
content. This raises critical concerns around privacy-preserving synthetic
data, and more specifically around privacy leakage, an issue closely tied to
overfitting. Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to
estimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only
quantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation
methods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical
deployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value
statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic
sample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy
leak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET
reliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse
data modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited
sample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We
compare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show
its advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments
through qualitative and quantitative outputs. Additionally, our analysis
reveals limitations in existing computer vision embeddings to yield
perceptually meaningful distances when identifying near-duplicate samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法要么在数据丰富机制下获得最优遗憾但无法避免维度多项式依赖，要么在数据稀缺机制下实现维度独立但回合数依赖较差。需要一种能在两种机制下同时达到最优最坏情况遗憾的自适应算法

Method: 采用稀疏乐观信息导向采样，通过新颖的分析方法使用时间依赖的学习率，平衡信息获取和遗憾最小化

Result: SOIDS算法在两种机制下同时达到最优最坏情况遗憾，扩展了IDS的理论保证，是首个实现这一目标的算法

Conclusion: SOIDS在无需贝叶斯假设的情况下成功实现了在数据丰富和数据稀缺机制下的自适应最优性能，实验验证了其良好表现

Abstract: Many high-dimensional online decision-making problems can be modeled as
stochastic sparse linear bandits. Most existing algorithms are designed to
achieve optimal worst-case regret in either the data-rich regime, where
polynomial dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable, or the data-poor
regime, where dimension-independence is possible at the cost of worse
dependence on the number of rounds. In contrast, the sparse Information
Directed Sampling (IDS) algorithm satisfies a Bayesian regret bound that has
the optimal rate in both regimes simultaneously. In this work, we explore the
use of Sparse Optimistic Information Directed Sampling (SOIDS) to achieve the
same adaptivity in the worst-case setting, without Bayesian assumptions.
Through a novel analysis that enables the use of a time-dependent learning
rate, we show that SOIDS can optimally balance information and regret. Our
results extend the theoretical guarantees of IDS, providing the first algorithm
that simultaneously achieves optimal worst-case regret in both the data-rich
and data-poor regimes. We empirically demonstrate the good performance of
SOIDS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对奖励模型依赖二元标签导致推理不匹配，点对方法需要复杂标注且适应性差。需要一种统一框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 结合偏好感知奖励机制和动态标准适应系统，利用成对数据中的相对偏好信息构建点对训练信号，同时生成全局任务一致性和实例特定细粒度推理的评估标准。

Result: 在RewardBench和RMBench上平均相对提升4.7%，在IFEval和InFoBench基准测试中下游RLHF性能平均提升13.6%。

Conclusion: PaTaRM实现了高效、可泛化且可解释的奖励建模，有效提升了RLHF性能。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF), providing the critical supervision signals that align large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. While generative reward models (GRMs)
offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training
paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad
labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex
pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand,
point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven
criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this
work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a
unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism
with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference
information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals,
eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs
a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for
both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This
design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for
RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative
improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B
models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average
improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its
effectiveness and robustness. Our code is available at

Method: 扩展TLogic规则框架，在规则格式中引入实体类别作为关键组件来限制规则应用范围。对于图中未知类别，提出基于LLM的数据驱动方法生成类别，并研究类别预测中检索实体得分聚合方法的选择。

Result: 该方法在保持高准确率的同时提供了可解释的预测，通过实体类别限制提高了规则应用的精确性，LLM方法有效解决了类别未知的问题。

Conclusion: 提出的扩展规则框架成功结合了预测准确性和可解释性，实体类别机制和LLM生成方法为时间知识图谱预测提供了更透明和实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a powerful way of not only modeling
static relationships between entities but also the dynamics of how relations
evolve over time. As these informational structures can be used to store
information from a real-world setting, such as a news flow, predicting future
graph components to a certain extent equates predicting real-world events. Most
of the research in this field focuses on embedding-based methods, often
leveraging convolutional neural net architectures. These solutions act as black
boxes, limiting insight. In this paper, we explore an extension to an
established rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in
combination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows
the end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the
prediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key
component with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant
entities. When categories are unknown for building the graph, we propose a
data-driven method to generate them with an LLM-based approach. Additionally,
we investigate the choice of aggregation method for scores of retrieved
entities when performing category prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALS框架通过将KV缓存投影到紧凑的潜在空间并进行稀疏token选择，解决了长上下文LLM推理中的KV缓存压缩问题，避免了RoPE机制带来的重建开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文LLM推理面临KV缓存大小和内存带宽的挑战，现有低秩压缩方法因RoPE机制导致精度下降或速度瓶颈。

Method: 提出SALS框架：将KV缓存投影到低维潜在空间，在该空间中进行RoPE-free的查询-键交互以选择重要token，仅重建少量重要token。

Result: 在多种任务上验证，SALS实现6.4倍KV缓存压缩和5.7倍注意力算子加速，端到端吞吐量在4k和32k序列上分别提升1.4倍和4.5倍。

Conclusion: SALS通过潜在空间稀疏注意力实现了高效的KV缓存压缩，在保持竞争性精度的同时显著提升推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high
demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value
cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has
demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden
dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to
the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive
low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed
bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply
RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of
RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a
higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent
space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on
these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS
projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and
performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this
space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the
overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on
various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and
additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA
performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS
achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention
operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end
throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared
to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.

Conclusion: 提出的语法在保持模型灵活性的同时避免过拟合，支持领域特定表达式的集成，为可解释分类提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Equation Discovery techniques have shown considerable success in regression
tasks, where they are used to discover concise and interpretable models
(\textit{Symbolic Regression}). In this paper, we propose a new ED-based binary
classification framework. Our proposed method EDC finds analytical functions of
manageable size that specify the location and shape of the decision boundary.
In extensive experiments on artificial and real-life data, we demonstrate how
EDC is able to discover both the structure of the target equation as well as
the value of its parameters, outperforming the current state-of-the-art
ED-based classification methods in binary classification and achieving
performance comparable to the state of the art in binary classification. We
suggest a grammar of modest complexity that appears to work well on the tested
datasets but argue that the exact grammar -- and thus the complexity of the
models -- is configurable, and especially domain-specific expressions can be
included in the pattern language, where that is required. The presented grammar
consists of a series of summands (additive terms) that include linear,
quadratic and exponential terms, as well as products of two features (producing
hyperbolic curves ideal for capturing XOR-like dependencies). The experiments
demonstrate that this grammar allows fairly flexible decision boundaries while
not so rich to cause overfitting.

TL;DR: Cluster-PFN是一种基于Transformer的模型，通过合成数据训练实现贝叶斯聚类，能准确估计聚类数量，处理缺失数据，比传统方法更快更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯聚类虽然能处理不确定性，但计算成本高，且现实数据常含缺失值，简单插补会忽略不确定性导致结果不佳。

Method: 使用Transformer架构扩展Prior-Data Fitted Networks，在有限高斯混合模型先验生成的合成数据集上训练，学习估计聚类数量和分配的后验分布。

Result: 比AIC、BIC和变分推断更准确估计聚类数量，聚类质量与变分推断相当但速度快几个数量级，在高缺失率下优于基于插补的基线方法。

Conclusion: Cluster-PFN提供了可扩展和灵活的贝叶斯聚类解决方案，能有效处理缺失数据和聚类不确定性。

Abstract: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding
at scale. Furthermore, real-world datasets often contain missing values, and
simple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty, resulting in suboptimal
results. We present Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model that extends
Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to unsupervised Bayesian clustering. Trained
entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior, Cluster-PFN learns to estimate the posterior distribution over
both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments. Our method estimates
the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection
procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves
clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster.
Cluster-PFN can be trained on complex priors that include missing data,
outperforming imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets, at
high missingness. These results show that the Cluster-PFN can provide scalable
and flexible Bayesian clustering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了视觉语言模型(VLMs)中的上下文学习能力，发现在多模态任务中，当前VLMs主要依赖文本线索而未能有效整合视觉信息，存在多模态融合能力有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管上下文学习在大型语言模型中已被广泛研究，但在视觉语言模型中的有效性仍未充分探索。本文旨在系统分析VLMs在多模态任务中的上下文学习能力。

Method: 评估了涵盖四种架构的七个VLMs模型，在三个图像描述基准上进行测试。分析了提示设计、架构选择和训练策略对多模态上下文学习的影响，并首次分析了注意力模式随上下文示例数量的变化。

Result: 训练于图像-文本交错数据能提升上下文学习性能，但不意味着能有效整合演示示例中的视觉和文本信息。指令调优改善了指令跟随能力，但可能减少对上下文示例的依赖，表明指令对齐和上下文适应之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在上下文学习能力上存在关键限制，主要关注文本线索而未能充分利用视觉信息，这为增强其从多模态上下文示例中学习的能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks
from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been
extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in
VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image
captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and
training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the
first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number
of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text
interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective
integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In
contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce
reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between
instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further
show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage
visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration.
These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs
and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal
in-context examples.

low confidence. This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to
enhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering
low-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance
Hardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining
the dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism
during inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We
evaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating
its effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive
performance and rejection rate. Additionally, we use alternative criteria -
influence values for filtering and uncertainty for rejection - as baselines to
evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that
integrating IH filtering with confidence-based rejection effectively enhances
model performance while preserving a large proportion of instances. This
approach provides a practical method for deploying ML systems in
safety-critical applications.

*Yuanyuan Wu,Zhenlin Qin,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个代表性-隐私-效用（RPU）框架来系统评估合成出行数据，发现合成数据不能固有保证隐私，且没有"一刀切"的模型，隐私与代表性/效用之间存在明显权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能卡数据在公共交通研究中面临的隐私和可访问性挑战，但现有评估方法零散，缺乏对群体层面变化或任务特定效用的考虑。

Method: 提出了RPU框架，在三个互补维度（代表性、隐私、效用）和三个层次（记录、群体、总体）上系统评估合成出行数据，整合了一致的指标集来量化相似性、披露风险和实践有用性。

Result: 对12种代表性生成方法进行基准测试，结果显示合成数据不能固有保证隐私，隐私与代表性/效用之间存在明显权衡，条件表格生成对抗网络（CTGAN）提供了最平衡的权衡。

Conclusion: RPU框架为研究人员和从业者提供了系统且可重复的基础，用于比较合成数据生成技术并在公共交通应用中选择适当方法。

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising solution to the privacy and accessibility
challenges of using smart card data in public transport research. Despite rapid
progress in generative modeling, there is limited attention to comprehensive
evaluation, leaving unclear how reliable, safe, and useful synthetic data truly
are. Existing evaluations remain fragmented, typically limited to
population-level representativeness or record-level privacy, without
considering group-level variations or task-specific utility. To address this
gap, we propose a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework that
systematically evaluates synthetic trip data across three complementary
dimensions and three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). The
framework integrates a consistent set of metrics to quantify similarity,
disclosure risk, and practical usefulness, enabling transparent and balanced
assessment of synthetic data quality. We apply the framework to benchmark
twelve representative generation methods, spanning conventional statistical
models, deep generative networks, and privacy-enhanced variants. Results show
that synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy and there is no
"one-size-fits-all" model, the trade-off between privacy and
representativeness/utility is obvious. Conditional Tabular generative
adversarial network (CTGAN) provide the most balanced trade-off and is
suggested for practical applications. The RPU framework provides a systematic
and reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic
data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组合合成库规模庞大（数十亿化合物），传统虚拟筛选方法受计算预算限制只能评估不到0.1%的化合物，可能遗漏许多高分化合物，且现有算法难以适应筛选过程中目标和约束的变化。

Method: 利用神经网络代理模型，利用组合合成库的结构特性来预测目标和约束，在消费级GPU上实现快速全库枚举，实现近似最优k个化合物的精确检索。

Conclusion: APEX协议能够有效解决大规模组合合成库的虚拟筛选问题，在有限计算预算下实现高效准确的化合物检索。

Abstract: Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL
have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size
presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the
top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g.,
optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited
computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of
billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual
screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available
compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.
Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course
of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms
typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the
approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a
neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction
of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU
possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$
sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised
of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their
docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical
properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of
constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared
against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's
consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared
to alternative methods.

Conclusion: 通过演示初始化价值函数的方法能有效减少探索负担，提高稀疏奖励环境中强化学习的样本效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in sparse-reward environments remains a
significant challenge due to the lack of informative feedback. We propose a
simple yet effective method that uses a small number of successful
demonstrations to initialize the value function of an RL agent. By precomputing
value estimates from offline demonstrations and using them as targets for early
learning, our approach provides the agent with a useful prior over promising
actions. The agent then refines these estimates through standard online
interaction. This hybrid offline-to-online paradigm significantly reduces the
exploration burden and improves sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings.
Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method accelerates
convergence and outperforms standard baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal
demonstration data.

Motivation: 传统强化学习算法通常设计用于离散时间动态，而现实世界的控制系统往往是连续时间的，因此需要开发专门针对连续时间动态的强化学习方法。

Method: 使用高斯过程和贝叶斯神经网络等概率模型学习非线性ODE系统动态的不确定性感知模型，通过贪婪最大化外部奖励和模型认知不确定性的加权和来设计COMBRL算法。

Result: COMBRL在奖励驱动设置中实现了次线性遗憾，在无监督RL设置中提供了样本复杂度界限，实验表明其比现有方法更具可扩展性和样本效率，在多个深度RL任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: COMBRL为连续时间模型强化学习提供了一种有效解决方案，通过结合概率模型和不确定性感知学习，在样本效率和性能方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed for discrete-time
dynamics, even though the underlying real-world control systems are often
continuous in time. In this paper, we study the problem of continuous-time
reinforcement learning, where the unknown system dynamics are represented using
nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We leverage probabilistic
models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to learn an
uncertainty-aware model of the underlying ODE. Our algorithm, COMBRL, greedily
maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic
uncertainty. This yields a scalable and sample-efficient approach to
continuous-time model-based RL. We show that COMBRL achieves sublinear regret
in the reward-driven setting, and in the unsupervised RL setting (i.e., without
extrinsic rewards), we provide a sample complexity bound. In our experiments,
we evaluate COMBRL in both standard and unsupervised RL settings and
demonstrate that it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods,
and outperforms baselines across several deep RL tasks.

Motivation: 现有脓毒症研究存在数据集过时、预处理流程不可复现、临床干预覆盖有限等问题，需要构建一个可复现的标准化研究平台。

Method: 基于Sepsis-3标准构建预处理流程，采用结构化插补策略，整合血管加压药、液体、机械通气和抗生素等治疗数据，建立基准预测任务。

Abstract: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), yet
existing research often relies on outdated datasets, non-reproducible
preprocessing pipelines, and limited coverage of clinical interventions. We
introduce MIMIC-Sepsis, a curated cohort and benchmark framework derived from
the MIMIC-IV database, designed to support reproducible modeling of sepsis
trajectories. Our cohort includes 35,239 ICU patients with time-aligned
clinical variables and standardized treatment data, including vasopressors,
fluids, mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. We describe a transparent
preprocessing pipeline-based on Sepsis-3 criteria, structured imputation
strategies, and treatment inclusion-and release it alongside benchmark tasks
focused on early mortality prediction, length-of-stay estimation, and shock
onset classification. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating
treatment variables substantially improves model performance, particularly for
Transformer-based architectures. MIMIC-Sepsis serves as a robust platform for
evaluating predictive and sequential models in critical care research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的联邦学习方法FLIU，通过个性化更新步骤解决异构数据环境下的客户端漂移问题，并在多个数据集和分布条件下评估了联邦学习方法的本地性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在异构数据联邦学习中，本地模型会收敛到各自的局部最优解，偏离全局数据分布。FedAvg等聚合方法往往无法达到全局模型最优，导致对大多数客户端次优的更新。现有个性化联邦学习方法主要关注本地性能，但忽略了FedAvg带来的泛化能力这一重要鲁棒性优势。

Method: 提出了联邦学习个性化更新方法(FLIU)，在FedAvg基础上增加简单的个性化步骤和自适应个性化因子。在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，使用IID、病理性非IID以及新开发的Dirichlet分布等不同分布条件进行实证评估，分析单个通信轮次中不同阶段的指标。

Result: 通过实验评估比较了各种联邦学习方法，包括提出的FLIU方法。在复杂数据异构环境下测试了算法的性能，重点关注本地性能和泛化能力的平衡。

Conclusion: FLIU方法通过个性化更新步骤有效解决了客户端漂移问题，在保持FedAvg泛化优势的同时提升了本地性能，为联邦学习在异构数据环境下的应用提供了更平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.

Motivation: 现有LoRA初始化方法存在局限性：许多方法未利用目标域数据，而基于梯度的方法仅通过一步梯度分解浅层利用数据，且缺乏严格理论基础或依赖限制性假设。

Method: 建立基于渐近分析的理论框架，通过最小化微调模型与目标模型参数差异的期望，推导出包含偏差项和方差项的优化问题，并开发LoRA-DA算法从少量目标域样本估计优化项。

Conclusion: LoRA-DA提供了一个理论严谨的数据感知LoRA初始化框架，通过有效利用目标域数据显著提升了微调性能，为参数高效微调提供了新的理论基础和实践方法。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of LLMs, LoRA has become a dominant method for
PEFT, and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention.
However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not
incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only
at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains
unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step
fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these
methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on
restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical
framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.
Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation
of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we
derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is
related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and
is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and
a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling
stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we
obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this
theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which
estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target
domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final
accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster,
more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small
initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon
publication.

Result: 大量实验表明DistDF提升了多种预测模型的性能，并达到了最先进的预测性能。

Conclusion: DistDF通过分布对齐方法有效解决了时间序列预测中的条件分布偏差问题，显著提升了预测准确性。

Abstract: Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional
distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard
direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative
log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean
squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of
label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves
alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional
forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are
difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a
newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series
forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of
interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from
empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training.
Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse
forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Code

Abstract: Current quantum machine learning approaches often face challenges balancing
predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. To address this, we
propose a novel quantum adversarial framework that integrates a hybrid quantum
neural network (QNN) with classical deep learning layers, guided by an
evaluator model with LIME-based interpretability, and extended through quantum
GAN and self-supervised variants. In the proposed model, an adversarial
evaluator concurrently guides the QNN by computing feedback loss, thereby
optimizing both prediction accuracy and model explainability. Empirical
evaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE
= 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, delivering the most consistent performance across
regression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts. These results
demonstrate the potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical
architectures to develop lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable
predictive models, advancing the applicability of QML beyond current
limitations.

Motivation: 时序数据中的因果发现面临组合复杂性挑战，传统基于排序的方法因使用单一排序而限制了模型表达能力，需要改进。

Conclusion: DOTS为时序因果发现提供了一个可扩展且准确的解决方案，通过多排序方法有效缓解了单排序方法中的伪影问题。

Abstract: Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for
understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate
dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is
hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal
relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A
common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.
Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of
the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple
valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We
propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based
causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS
effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic
graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We
formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the
additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to
enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the
approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a
scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic
benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS
improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the
CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the
best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph
$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These
results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal
discovery.

robustness ratio $\rho = \mu / \epsilon$. Unlike prior work, we provide a
fine-grained analysis across the entire range $\rho \in (0,1)$ and obtain
tighter upper and lower bounds that improve upon existing results. Our findings
reveal that the parameter complexity of robust memorization matches that of
non-robust memorization when $\rho$ is small, but grows with increasing $\rho$.

TL;DR: Pearl是一个用于蛋白质-配体共折叠的基础模型，通过大规模合成数据训练、SO(3)等变扩散架构和可控推理等创新，在蛋白质-配体复合物结构预测方面实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决蛋白质-配体复合物三维结构预测的挑战，包括实验数据稀缺、架构效率低、物理无效姿态以及无法充分利用推理时可用辅助信息等问题。

Method: 采用大规模合成数据训练、SO(3)等变扩散模块以尊重3D旋转对称性，以及支持蛋白质和非聚合组件的可控推理系统。

Result: 在Runs N' Poses和PoseBusters基准测试中，Pearl在生成准确（RMSD < 2Å）且物理有效姿态方面比AlphaFold 3和其他开源基线分别提升了14.5%和14.2%。在口袋条件共折叠机制下，在更严格的RMSD < 1Å阈值下实现了3.6倍的改进。

Conclusion: Pearl通过创新的训练策略和架构设计，显著提升了蛋白质-配体共折叠的预测精度，模型性能与训练中使用的合成数据集大小直接相关。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand
complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that
limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have
recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving
promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their
performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data,
inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to
exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues,
we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation
model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges
with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale
synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an
SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational
symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3)
controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system
supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual
unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating
accurate (RMSD < 2 \r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold
3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters
benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the
next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers
$3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug
targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate
that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中A/B测试常因数据分布偏离正态或处理组与对照组样本量不等而不可靠，导致Type I错误失控，可能推出有害策略。

Method: 量化偏态和长尾数据以及不等分配对误差率的影响，推导t检验有效的最小样本量公式，提出基于Edgeworth的p值校正方法。

Result: 发现许多在线反馈指标需要数亿样本才能确保可靠的A/B测试，校正方法在真实条件下显著提高了测试的可靠性。

Conclusion: 提出的最小样本量阈值和校正方法能显著提升A/B测试在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: A/B testing has become the cornerstone of decision-making in online markets,
guiding how platforms launch new features, optimize pricing strategies, and
improve user experience. In practice, we typically employ the pairwise $t$-test
to compare outcomes between the treatment and control groups, thereby assessing
the effectiveness of a given strategy. To be trustworthy, these experiments
must keep Type I error (i.e., false positive rate) under control; otherwise, we
may launch harmful strategies. However, in real-world applications, we find
that A/B testing often fails to deliver reliable results. When the data
distribution departs from normality or when the treatment and control groups
differ in sample size, the commonly used pairwise $t$-test is no longer
trustworthy. In this paper, we quantify how skewed, long tailed data and
unequal allocation distort error rates and derive explicit formulas for the
minimum sample size required for the $t$-test to remain valid. We find that
many online feedback metrics require hundreds of millions samples to ensure
reliable A/B testing. Thus we introduce an Edgeworth-based correction that
provides more accurate $p$-values when the available sample size is limited.
Offline experiments on a leading A/B testing platform corroborate the practical
value of our theoretical minimum sample size thresholds and demonstrate that
the corrected method substantially improves the reliability of A/B testing in
real-world conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分平均场近似在处理当代过参数化深度神经网络时表现不佳，导致训练不稳定、预测能力差和校准效果差。需要构建能够反映重参数化几何特性的推理机制。

Method: 提出简单的变分族，考虑参数空间中两个独立的线性子空间：一个表示训练数据支持内的函数变化，另一个表示支持外的变化。构建完全相关的近似后验，调整易于解释的超参数，并开发可扩展的数值例程来最大化ELBO和从近似后验中采样。

Result: 在任务、模型和数据集上观察到与多种基线方法相比的最先进性能，表明贝叶斯推理应用于深度神经网络并非无望。

Conclusion: 当构建反映重参数化几何特性的推理机制时，近似贝叶斯推理应用于深度神经网络是可行的，能够实现高质量的预测和不确定性估计。

Abstract: Variational mean field approximations tend to struggle with contemporary
overparametrized deep neural networks. Where a Bayesian treatment is usually
associated with high-quality predictions and uncertainties, the practical
reality has been the opposite, with unstable training, poor predictive power,
and subpar calibration. Building upon recent work on reparametrizations of
neural networks, we propose a simple variational family that considers two
independent linear subspaces of the parameter space. These represent functional
changes inside and outside the support of training data. This allows us to
build a fully-correlated approximate posterior reflecting the
overparametrization that tunes easy-to-interpret hyperparameters. We develop
scalable numerical routines that maximize the associated evidence lower bound
(ELBO) and sample from the approximate posterior. Empirically, we observe
state-of-the-art performance across tasks, models, and datasets compared to a
wide array of baseline methods. Our results show that approximate Bayesian
inference applied to deep neural networks is far from a lost cause when
constructing inference mechanisms that reflect the geometry of
reparametrizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯神经网络在不确定性量化中很重要，但其先验通常缺乏可解释性；而高斯过程虽然可解释性强，但难以扩展到大数据集。需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 通过协方差核的Mercer表示，直接在网络参数上定义先验，使BNN的样本能够近似指定的高斯过程，不依赖特定的网络结构。

Result: 提出的Mercer先验方法能够使BNN产生近似高斯过程的样本，同时保持BNN的可扩展性优势。

Conclusion: Mercer先验为BNN提供了一种有意义且可解释的贝叶斯框架，结合了BNN的可扩展性和GP的可解释性优势。

Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty in the output of a neural network is essential
for deployment in scientific or engineering applications where decisions must
be made under limited or noisy data. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide a
framework for this purpose by constructing a Bayesian posterior distribution
over the network parameters. However, the prior, which is of key importance in
any Bayesian setting, is rarely meaningful for BNNs. This is because the
complexity of the input-to-output map of a BNN makes it difficult to understand
how certain distributions enforce any interpretable constraint on the output
space. Gaussian processes (GPs), on the other hand, are often preferred in
uncertainty quantification tasks due to their interpretability. The drawback is
that GPs are limited to small datasets without advanced techniques, which often
rely on the covariance kernel having a specific structure. To address these
challenges, we introduce a new class of priors for BNNs, called Mercer priors,
such that the resulting BNN has samples which approximate that of a specified
GP. The method works by defining a prior directly over the network parameters
from the Mercer representation of the covariance kernel, and does not rely on
the network having a specific structure. In doing so, we can exploit the
scalability of BNNs in a meaningful Bayesian way.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统公平方法只在预测层面施加约束，未能解决数据表示中的潜在偏见，导致不公平结果。

Method: 使用充分降维将特征空间分解为目标相关、敏感和共享组件，通过选择性移除敏感信息来控制公平性-效用权衡，并利用影响函数量化参数估计的渐近行为。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了理论见解，表明该方法能有效提高公平性同时保持预测性能。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种原则性方法来处理数据表示中的偏见，在保持预测效用的同时改善公平性。

Abstract: Machine learning models have achieved widespread success but often inherit
and amplify historical biases, resulting in unfair outcomes. Traditional
fairness methods typically impose constraints at the prediction level, without
addressing underlying biases in data representations. In this work, we propose
a principled framework that adjusts data representations to balance predictive
utility and fairness. Using sufficient dimension reduction, we decompose the
feature space into target-relevant, sensitive, and shared components, and
control the fairness-utility trade-off by selectively removing sensitive
information. We provide a theoretical analysis of how prediction error and
fairness gaps evolve as shared subspaces are added, and employ influence
functions to quantify their effects on the asymptotic behavior of parameter
estimates. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our
theoretical insights and show that the proposed method effectively improves
fairness while preserving predictive performance.

Conclusion: 通过将约束生成模型与反射扩散模型进行综合比较，为约束条件下的生成建模提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Score-based generative models based on stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) achieve impressive performance in sampling from unknown distributions,
but often fail to satisfy underlying constraints. We propose a constrained
generative model using kinetic (underdamped) Langevin dynamics with specular
reflection of velocity on the boundary defining constraints. This results in
piecewise continuously differentiable noising and denoising process where the
latter is characterized by a time-reversed dynamics restricted to a domain with
boundary due to specular boundary condition. In addition, we also contribute to
existing reflected SDEs based constrained generative models, where the
stochastic dynamics is restricted through an abstract local time term. By
presenting efficient numerical samplers which converge with optimal rate in
terms of discretizations step, we provide a comprehensive comparison of models
based on confined (specularly reflected kinetic) Langevin diffusion with models
based on reflected diffusion with local time.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了Copula-Stein Discrepancy (CSD)，一种专门针对统计依赖结构的新型差异度量方法，能够有效检测高阶依赖结构（如尾部依赖），解决了传统KSD在此方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准核Stein差异(KSD)对高阶依赖结构（如尾部依赖）不敏感，而这些结构在科学和金融领域至关重要。需要一种能够专门检测依赖结构不匹配的差异度量方法。

Method: 通过在copula密度上直接定义Stein算子，利用依赖的生成结构而非联合密度的得分函数。对于Archimedean copulas，该方法从标量生成函数推导出闭式Stein核。

Result: 理论分析证明CSD：(i) 度量copula分布的弱收敛，确保检测任何依赖不匹配；(ii) 经验估计器以最小最大最优速率O_P(n^{-1/2})收敛；(iii) 对尾部依赖系数的差异具有可证明的敏感性。计算上，精确CSD核评估在维度上线性扩展，随机特征近似将n依赖从O(n^2)降低到近线性。

Conclusion: CSD提供了一个实用且理论上有原则的工具，用于依赖感知的推断，特别适用于检测传统方法难以捕捉的高阶依赖结构。

Abstract: Kernel Stein discrepancies (KSDs) have become a principal tool for
goodness-of-fit testing, but standard KSDs are often insensitive to
higher-order dependency structures, such as tail dependence, which are critical
in many scientific and financial domains. We address this gap by introducing
the Copula-Stein Discrepancy (CSD), a novel class of discrepancies tailored to
the geometry of statistical dependence. By defining a Stein operator directly
on the copula density, CSD leverages the generative structure of dependence,
rather than relying on the joint density's score function. For the broad class
of Archimedean copulas, this approach yields a closed-form Stein kernel derived
from the scalar generator function. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
analysis, proving that CSD (i) metrizes weak convergence of copula
distributions, ensuring it detects any mismatch in dependence; (ii) has an
empirical estimator that converges at the minimax optimal rate of
$O_P(n^{-1/2})$; and (iii) is provably sensitive to differences in tail
dependence coefficients. The framework is extended to general non-Archimedean
copulas, including elliptical and vine copulas. Computationally, the exact CSD
kernel evaluation scales linearly in dimension, while a novel random feature
approximation reduces the $n$-dependence from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to near-linear
$\tilde{O}(n)$, making CSD a practical and theoretically principled tool for
dependence-aware inference.

Result: 在d维超立方体和欧几里得球上实现了O(d√(n ln n))的遗憾界。在欧几里得球上匹配现有自协调FTRL方法，在超立方体上比这些方法改进了√d倍，达到对数因子内的最优界。

Conclusion: 成功构建了连接FTRL和FTPL的统一框架，通过自协调扰动设计的新算法在多个领域实现了最优或改进的性能。

Abstract: We study the adversarial linear bandits problem and present a unified
algorithmic framework that bridges Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and
Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) methods, extending the known connection
between them from the full-information setting. Within this framework, we
introduce self-concordant perturbations, a family of probability distributions
that mirror the role of self-concordant barriers previously employed in the
FTRL-based SCRiBLe algorithm. Using this idea, we design a novel FTPL-based
algorithm that combines self-concordant regularization with efficient
stochastic exploration. Our approach achieves a regret of $O(d\sqrt{n \ln n})$
on both the $d$-dimensional hypercube and the Euclidean ball. On the Euclidean
ball, this matches the rate attained by existing self-concordant FTRL methods.
For the hypercube, this represents a $\sqrt{d}$ improvement over these methods
and matches the optimal bound up to logarithmic factors.

Motivation: 比较神经网络和广义可加模型(GAMs)在真实世界表格数据上的性能表现，分析两种方法的相对优势和适用场景。

Method: 遵循PRISMA指南进行系统综述，收集了143篇论文中的430个数据集，使用混合效应模型分析性能指标差异，考察应用领域、研究年份、样本量、预测变量数量和神经网络复杂度等因素。

Result: 在常用指标(RMSE、R²、AUC)上，两种方法没有一致的优势证据。神经网络在大数据集和多预测变量时表现更好，但优势随时间减弱。GAMs在小数据场景中保持竞争力，同时保持可解释性。文献中数据集特征和神经网络复杂度的报告不完整。

Conclusion: GAMs和神经网络应被视为互补方法而非竞争对手。对于许多表格应用，性能差异不大，而可解释性可能更倾向于GAMs。

Abstract: Neural networks have become a popular tool in predictive modelling, more
commonly associated with machine learning and artificial intelligence than with
statistics. Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) are flexible non-linear
statistical models that retain interpretability. Both are state-of-the-art in
their own right, with their respective advantages and disadvantages. This paper
analyses how these two model classes have performed on real-world tabular data.
Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of papers that
performed empirical comparisons of GAMs and neural networks. Eligible papers
were identified, yielding 143 papers, with 430 datasets. Key attributes at both
paper and dataset levels were extracted and reported. Beyond summarising
comparisons, we analyse reported performance metrics using mixed-effects
modelling to investigate potential characteristics that can explain and
quantify observed differences, including application area, study year, sample
size, number of predictors, and neural network complexity. Across datasets, no
consistent evidence of superiority was found for either GAMs or neural networks
when considering the most frequently reported metrics (RMSE, $R^2$, and AUC).
Neural networks tended to outperform in larger datasets and in those with more
predictors, but this advantage narrowed over time. Conversely, GAMs remained
competitive, particularly in smaller data settings, while retaining
interpretability. Reporting of dataset characteristics and neural network
complexity was incomplete in much of the literature, limiting transparency and
reproducibility. This review highlights that GAMs and neural networks should be
viewed as complementary approaches rather than competitors. For many tabular
applications, the performance trade-off is modest, and interpretability may
favour GAMs.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For three decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to
analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to
tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going
beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively
answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer
perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it
more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive
than narrow ones or with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the
challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and
data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider
the matched teacher-student setting. It provides the fundamental limits of
learning random deep neural network targets and helps in identifying the
sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network
as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various
learning transitions. With enough data optimal performance is attained through
model's "specialisation" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for
training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by
the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating
from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer.
Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the
Bayesian-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and
finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning
regime that are potentially relevant way beyond it.
