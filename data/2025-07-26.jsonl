This work\nfocuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and\ncarrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for\nlocating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances\nchannel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an\nexisting multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot\n(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix\n(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs\ndifferent Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via\ncorrelation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a\ncorrelation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot\nstructure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is\nproposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the\ndelay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO\nestimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'\nsignals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical\nthreshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major\npeak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest\npeak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the\nproposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique\nreduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into\nmultiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to\neffectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO\nestimates for all the users."}

However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers.

We\nprovide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the\nphenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the\nheavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior\nwork, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of\npretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either\ntesting or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics\nas well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.\nThe derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,\nincluding a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of\nthe Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions\nof SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating\nexcellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,\nwe show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by\nsimply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight\nmatrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the\nperformance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find\nthat they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs."}

However, these\nmethods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,\nrequiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)\ninvariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to\nthe number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer\narchitecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large\nlanguage models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our\napproach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to\ncomparable non-invariant architectures."}

Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models\nhave shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.\nHowever, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de\nnovo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.\nConsidering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level\nstructures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that\nintegrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient\nend-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating\nrepresentations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can\neffectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,\nresulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated\nprotein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to\nevaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.\nOur new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional\nsimilarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring\nconditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the\nresults on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the\nproposed generation framework and evaluation metric."}

Existing\nadaptive ensemble methods often rely on coarse-grained adaptation mechanisms or\nsimple voting schemes that fail to optimally leverage specialized knowledge.\nThis paper introduces DriftMoE, an online Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture\nthat addresses these limitations through a novel co-training framework.\nDriftMoE features a compact neural router that is co-trained alongside a pool\nof incremental Hoeffding tree experts. The key innovation lies in a symbiotic\nlearning loop that enables expert specialization: the router selects the most\nsuitable expert for prediction, the relevant experts update incrementally with\nthe true label, and the router refines its parameters using a multi-hot\ncorrectness mask that reinforces every accurate expert. This feedback loop\nprovides the router with a clear training signal while accelerating expert\nspecialization. We evaluate DriftMoE's performance across nine state-of-the-art\ndata stream learning benchmarks spanning abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts\ntesting two distinct configurations: one where experts specialize on data\nregimes (multi-class variant), and another where they focus on single-class\nspecialization (task-based variant). Our results demonstrate that DriftMoE\nachieves competitive results with state-of-the-art stream learning adaptive\nensembles, offering a principled and efficient approach to concept drift\nadaptation.

Such noise\ninflates the computed distances in a nontrivial way, leading to\nmisrepresentations of the underlying data geometry. In this work, we address\nthe tasks of estimating the noise magnitudes per observation and correcting the\npairwise Euclidean distances under heteroskedastic noise. Perhaps surprisingly,\nwe show that in general high-dimensional settings and without assuming prior\nknowledge on the clean data structure or noise distribution, both tasks can be\nperformed reliably, even when the noise levels vary considerably.
