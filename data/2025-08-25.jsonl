To address these limitations, post-training pruning has\nemerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency\nwithout the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing\npruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require\ncomputationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a\nnovel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained\nLLMs without any retraining.

However, these BB-domain approaches are\nconstrained by insufficient spatial resolution and the adverse effects of\nspatially correlated channels. To overcome these limitations, this paper\nproposes a novel secure ISAC framework empowered by compound reconfigurable\nantenna (CRA) arrays, which offer simultaneous reconfigurability of radiation\npatterns and polarization states in the electromagnetic (EM) domain.\nSpecifically, we develop a comprehensive channel model incorporating virtual\nangular domain, spatial domain, and depolarization effects, and formulate a\nmixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly design EM-domain\nand BB-domain precoders and combiners.

Third, the solution is not obtained in this enlarged feature space, but\nthrough solving a dual problem in the observation space.

In\nparticular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic\nProgramming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency\nfunctions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific\nphase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic\nfeatures of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this\nissue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the\nphase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This\nis represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the\nurgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve\nthe symmetric phase urgency function.

We structure our proposed\nframework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts\ncharacteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive\nunderstanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning\narchitecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while\nthe other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we\npropose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and\nreliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of\nthreat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods,\nand enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively\naddress complex threat scenarios."}

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable.

Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed.

Because of the lack of transparency, it\nis challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.\nHere, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm\nprediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict\nwhether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within\n24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our\napproach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM\nnetwork to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the\nmodel's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc\nmodel-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the\npredicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's\nbehavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm\nprediction model."}

Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can\nrestore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to\n15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and\na clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)\nDirection shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value\nmagnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and\nsmallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and\nshallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top\n20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)\nStronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones\nresist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD\nperformance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than\nfinding new solutions.

They have been popularized in support vector machines and used in\nkernel ridge regression, amongst others. Kernel methods share three aspects.\nFirst, instead of the original matrix of predictor variables or features, each\nobservation is mapped into an enlarged feature space. Second, a ridge penalty\nterm is used to shrink the coefficients on the features in the enlarged feature\nspace. Third, the solution is not obtained in this enlarged feature space, but\nthrough solving a dual problem in the observation space. A major drawback in\nthe present use of kernels is that the interpretation in terms of the original\nfeatures is lost. In this paper, we argue that in the case of a wide matrix of\nfeatures, where there are more features than observations, the kernel solution\ncan be re-expressed in terms of a linear combination of the original matrix of\nfeatures and a ridge penalty that involves a special metric. Consequently, the\nexact same predicted values can be obtained as a weighted linear combination of\nthe features in the usual manner and thus can be interpreted. In the case where\nthe number of features is less than the number of observations, we discuss a\nleast-squares approximation of the kernel matrix that still allows the\ninterpretation in terms of a linear combination. It is shown that these results\nhold for any function of a linear combination that minimizes the coefficients\nand has a ridge penalty on these coefficients, such as in kernel logistic\nregression and kernel Poisson regression.
