<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着FAS成为下一代无线通信的潜在技术，信道估计成为紧迫问题，现有方法在噪声抑制方面存在局限。

Method: 利用无线信道的稀疏性，结合ML迭代断层扫描算法，系统性减少噪声扰动，并利用FAS信道的空间相关性优化估计精度和频谱效率。

Abstract: With fluid antenna system (FAS) gradually establishing itself as a possible
enabling technology for next generation wireless communications, channel
estimation for FAS has become a pressing issue. Existing methodologies however
face limitations in noise suppression. To overcome this, in this paper, we
propose a maximum likelihood (ML)-based channel estimation approach tailored
for FAS systems, designed to mitigate noise interference and enhance estimation
accuracy. By capitalizing on the inherent sparsity of wireless channels, we
integrate an ML-based iterative tomographic algorithm to systematically reduce
noise perturbations during the channel estimation process. Furthermore, the
proposed approach leverages spatial correlation within the FAS channel to
optimize estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency. Simulation results
confirm the efficacy of the proposed method, demonstrating superior channel
estimation accuracy and robustness compared to existing benchmark techniques.

Conclusion: 该框架灵活且可扩展，适用于多种信道和噪声模型，为下一代通信系统的检测算法设计和分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a performance analysis framework for linear detection in
fast-fading channels with possibly correlated channel and noise. The framework
is both accurate and adaptable, making it well-suited for analyzing a wide
range of channel and noise models. As such, it serves as a valuable tool for
the design and evaluation of detection algorithms in next-generation wireless
communication systems. By characterizing the distribution of the effective
noise after zero-forcing filtering, we derive a semi-analytical and asymptotic
expression for the symbol error rate under Rayleigh fading and
channel-dependent additive circular complex Gaussian noise. The proposed
approach demonstrates excellent agreement with integration-based benchmarks as
confirmed by numerical simulations thus validating its accuracy. The framework
is flexible and can be extended to various channel and noise models, offering a
valuable tool for the design and analysis of detection algorithms in
next-generation communication systems.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Multiple Signal Classification algorithm is a powerful
technique for high-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in array
signal processing. However, the exhaustive search over the 2D an-gular domain
leads to high computa-tional cost, limiting its applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we reformulate the peak-finding process as a
multimodal optimization prob-lem, and propose a Differential Evolu-tion
algorithm with Neighborhood Mutation (DE-NM) to efficiently lo-cate multiple
spectral peaks without requiring dense grid sampling. Simu-lation results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable estimation accuracy to
the traditional grid search, while significantly reduc-ing computation time.
This strategy presents a promising solution for real-time, high-resolution DOA
estimation in practical applications. The imple-mentation code is available at

### [5] [Secure Communication of UAV-mounted STAR-RIS under Phase Shift Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06048)
*Aseel Qsibat,Habiba Akhleifa,Abdelhamid Salem,Khaled Rabie,Xingwang Li,Thokozani Shongwe,Mohamad A. Alawad,Yazeed Alkhrijah*

Abstract: This paper investigates the secure communication capabilities of a
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network supported by a STAR-RIS
(simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface)
deployed on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), in the presence of passive
eavesdroppers. The STAR-RIS facilitates concurrent signal reflection and
transmission, allowing multiple legitimate users-grouped via NOMA-to be served
efficiently, thereby improving spectral utilization. Each user contends with an
associated eavesdropper, creating a stringent security scenario. Under Nakagami
fading conditions and accounting for phase shift inaccuracies in the STAR-RIS,
closed-form expressions for the ergodic secrecy rates of users in both
transmission and reflection paths are derived. An optimization framework is
then developed to jointly adjust the UAV's positioning and the STAR-RIS power
splitting coefficient, aiming to maximize the system's secrecy rate. The
proposed approach enhances secure transmission in STAR-RIS-NOMA configurations
under realistic hardware constraints and offers valuable guidance for the
design of future 6G wireless networks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient acquisition of wireless channel state information
(CSI) is crucial to enhance the communication performance of wireless systems.
However, with the continuous densification of wireless links, increased channel
dimensions, and the use of higher-frequency bands, channel estimation in the
sixth generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks faces new challenges, such
as insufficient orthogonal pilot sequences, inadequate signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) for channel training, and more sophisticated channel statistical
distributions in complex environment. These challenges pose significant
difficulties for classical channel estimation algorithms like least squares
(LS) and maximum a posteriori (MAP). To address this problem, we propose a
novel environment-aware channel estimation framework with location-specific
prior channel distribution enabled by the new concept of channel knowledge map
(CKM). To this end, we propose a new type of CKM called channel score function
map (CSFM), which learns the channel probability density function (PDF) using
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. To fully exploit the prior information
in CSFM, we propose a plug-and-play (PnP) based algorithm to decouple the
regularized MAP channel estimation problem, thereby reducing the complexity of
the optimization process. Besides, we employ Tweedie's formula to establish a
connection between the channel score function, defined as the logarithmic
gradient of the channel PDF, and the channel denoiser. This allows the use of
the high-precision, environment-aware channel denoiser from the CSFM to
approximate the channel score function, thus enabling efficient processing of
the decoupled channel statistical components. Simulation results show that the
proposed CSFM-PnP based channel estimation technique significantly outperforms
the conventional techniques in the aforementioned challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Modern power systems face significant challenges in state estimation and
real-time monitoring, particularly regarding response speed and accuracy under
faulty conditions or cyber-attacks. This paper proposes a hybrid approach using
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to enhance the accuracy and
robustness, of power system state estimation. By embedding physical laws into

outperforms traditional machine learning models, achieving up to 83% higher
accuracy on unseen subsets of the training dataset and 65% better performance
on entirely new, unrelated datasets. Experiments also show that during a data
manipulation attack against a critical bus in a system, the PINN can be up to
93% more accurate than an equivalent neural network.

*Kaichen Ouyang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过类比安德森局域化分析了GNN中的过平滑现象，提出参与度作为量化指标，并探讨了通过减少信息传播中的无序性来缓解过平滑的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GNN网络深度增加，过平滑问题导致节点表征失去独特性，影响了模型的性能。

Method: 通过类比安德森局域化分析过平滑机制，引入参与度作为量化指标，并进行理论分析。

Result: 过平滑可理解为低频模式扩展和高频模式局域化，减少信息传播无序性可能缓解此问题。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了GNN过平滑与安德森局域化的潜在联系，为缓解过平滑提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in graph data
analysis due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, as the
network depth increases, the issue of over-smoothing becomes more severe,
causing node representations to lose their distinctiveness. This paper analyzes
the mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization
and introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon.
Specifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after
multiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness,
similar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems. In this
context, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of
low-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of
high-frequency modes (decreased participation degree). Based on this, we
systematically reviewed the potential connection between the Anderson
localization behavior in disordered systems and the over-smoothing behavior in
Graph Neural Networks. A theoretical analysis was conducted, and we proposed
the potential of alleviating over-smoothing by reducing the disorder in
information propagation.

Main category: cs.LG

Result: 在四个基准数据集上优于11个基线模型，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为时间序列预测中外生输入的使用提供了鲁棒且有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Although most transformer-based time series forecasting models primarily
depend on endogenous inputs, recent state-of-the-art approaches have
significantly improved performance by incorporating external information
through exogenous inputs. However, these methods face challenges, such as
redundancy when endogenous and exogenous inputs originate from the same source
and limited ability to capture long-term dependencies due to fixed look-back
windows. In this paper, we propose a method that whitens the exogenous input to
reduce redundancy that may persist within the data based on global statistics.
Additionally, our approach helps the exogenous input to be more aware of
patterns and trends over extended periods. By introducing this refined,
globally context-aware exogenous input to the endogenous input without
increasing the lookback window length, our approach guides the model towards
improved forecasting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
four benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming 11 baseline models. These
results establish our method as a robust and effective alternative for using
exogenous inputs in time series forecasting.

Result: 模型尺寸减少64%，准确性提升42%，优于现有XAI压缩方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合XAI与压缩技术，显著优化DNN性能与资源占用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many
tasks but it often comes at a high computational cost and memory usage.
Compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, are applied to reduce
the memory footprint of DNNs and make it possible to accommodate them on
resource-constrained edge devices. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods have been introduced with the purpose of
understanding and explaining AI methods. XAI can be utilized to get to know the
inner functioning of DNNs, such as the importance of different neurons and
features in the overall performance of DNNs. In this paper, a novel DNN
compression approach using XAI is proposed to efficiently reduce the DNN model
size with negligible accuracy loss. In the proposed approach, the importance
score of DNN parameters (i.e. weights) are computed using a gradient-based XAI
technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Then, the scores are
used to compress the DNN as follows: 1) the parameters with the negative or
zero importance scores are pruned and removed from the model, 2)
mixed-precision quantization is applied to quantize the weights with
higher/lower score with higher/lower number of bits. The experimental results
show that, the proposed compression approach reduces the model size by 64%
while the accuracy is improved by 42% compared to the state-of-the-art
XAI-based compression method.

Result: 在非线性超弹性情况下，相比有限元模拟，P-DivGNN显著提高了计算速度。

Conclusion: P-DivGNN为大规模应用提供了一种高效且物理约束的局部应力场预测方法。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to
reconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of
multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean,
macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic
micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural
network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing
average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or
Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local
stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the
definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical
constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state
and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary
conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated
considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying
geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves
significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it
particularly attractive for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate decay and defining a stopping
criterion, often relies on monitoring the validation loss. This paper presents
NeVe, a dynamic training approach that adjusts the learning rate and defines
the stop criterion based on the novel notion of "neural velocity". The neural
velocity measures the rate of change of each neuron's transfer function and is
an indicator of model convergence: sampling neural velocity can be performed
even by forwarding noise in the network, reducing the need for a held-out
dataset. Our findings show the potential of neural velocity as a key metric for
optimizing neural network training efficiently

Abstract: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly
important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft
tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation,
meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the
integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a
more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a
conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model
takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically
designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on
them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of
a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity
by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with
the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of
the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and
corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can
predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations
up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces
up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the
intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments.
Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the
potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are
required.

Conclusion: 该方法为RCPSP提供了一种新的无数据神经网络解决方案，有望提升并行计算效率。

Abstract: Dataless neural networks represent a paradigm shift in applying neural
architectures to combinatorial optimization problems, eliminating the need for
training datasets by encoding problem instances directly into network
parameters. Despite the pioneering work of Alkhouri et al. (2022) demonstrating
the viability of dataless approaches for the Maximum Independent Set problem,
our comprehensive literature review reveals that no published work has extended
these methods to the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP).
This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first dataless neural network
approach for RCPSP, providing a complete mathematical framework that transforms
discrete scheduling constraints into differentiable objectives suitable for
gradient-based optimization. Our approach leverages smooth relaxations and
automatic differentiation to unlock GPU parallelization for project scheduling,
traditionally a domain of sequential algorithms. We detail the mathematical
formulation for both precedence and renewable resource constraints, including a
memory-efficient dense time-grid representation. Implementation and
comprehensive experiments on PSPLIB benchmark instances (J30, J60, and J120)
are currently underway, with empirical results to be reported in an updated
version of this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习中，启发式奖励常被用于提升性能，但传统方法因依赖策略不变性而表现不佳，浪费资源。

Method: 提出HEPO框架，基于最大化策略改进的实用目标，避免传统方法的缺陷。

Result: HEPO在标准基准测试中表现优异，即使启发式奖励设计不佳也能取得良好效果。

Conclusion: HEPO显著减少了奖励设计的人力成本，为强化学习中的启发式奖励利用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, augmenting the task rewards
with heuristic rewards that encode human priors about how a task should be
solved is crucial for achieving desirable performance. However, because such
heuristics are usually not optimal, much human effort and computational
resources are wasted in carefully balancing tasks and heuristic rewards.
Theoretically rigorous ways of incorporating heuristics rely on the idea of
\textit{policy invariance}, which guarantees that the performance of a policy
obtained by maximizing heuristic rewards is the same as the optimal policy with
respect to the task reward. However, in practice, policy invariance doesn't
result in policy improvement, and such methods are known to empirically perform
poorly. We propose a new paradigm to mitigate reward hacking and effectively
use heuristics based on the practical goal of maximizing policy improvement
instead of policy improvement. Our framework, Heuristic Enhanced Policy
Optimization (HEPO), effectively leverages heuristics while avoiding the
pitfall of prior methods for mitigating reward hacking. HEPO achieves superior
performance on standard benchmarks with well-engineered reward functions. More
surprisingly, HEPO allows policy optimization to achieve good performance even
when heuristics are not well-engineered and designed by non-expert humans,
showcasing HEPO's ability to reduce human effort in reward design. % HEPO is a
plug-and-play optimization method for leveraging heuristics in reinforcement
learning. Code is available at https://github.com/Improbable-AI/hepo.

Abstract: Foundation models for structured time series data must contend with a
fundamental challenge: observations often conflate the true underlying physical
phenomena with systematic distortions introduced by measurement instruments.
This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or
multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model
that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a
dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning.
Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same
target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured
under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for
the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated
astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars
observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS),
our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation
models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These
results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation
models, including few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation, and
highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation
learning for structured data.

TL;DR: 论文提出从预测范式转向干预范式，强调自动化决策系统（ADS）应关注决策支持和实际影响，而非孤立预测任务。

Motivation: 现有ADS主要关注预测问题，但实际部署中它们通过政策干预影响群体结果，需更全面的视角。

Method: 提出新的问题设置，将预测视为决策支持、最终决策和结果的一部分，并整合统计框架研究ADS设计、实施和评估。

Result: 揭示了孤立预测任务的局限性，为干预导向的ADS开发和部署奠定基础。

Conclusion: 需转向干预范式，以更全面地评估和优化ADS在社会系统中的影响。

Abstract: Many automated decision systems (ADS) are designed to solve prediction
problems -- where the goal is to learn patterns from a sample of the population
and apply them to individuals from the same population. In reality, these
prediction systems operationalize holistic policy interventions in deployment.
Once deployed, ADS can shape impacted population outcomes through an effective
policy change in how decision-makers operate, while also being defined by past
and present interactions between stakeholders and the limitations of existing
organizational, as well as societal, infrastructure and context. In this work,
we consider the ways in which we must shift from a prediction-focused paradigm
to an interventionist paradigm when considering the impact of ADS within social
systems. We argue this requires a new default problem setup for ADS beyond
prediction, to instead consider predictions as decision support, final
decisions, and outcomes. We highlight how this perspective unifies modern
statistical frameworks and other tools to study the design, implementation, and
evaluation of ADS systems, and point to the research directions necessary to
operationalize this paradigm shift. Using these tools, we characterize the
limitations of focusing on isolated prediction tasks, and lay the foundation
for a more intervention-oriented approach to developing and deploying ADS.

TL;DR: 本文比较了持续后训练（CPT）中的监督微调（SFT）和强化微调（RFT），发现RFT在知识保留和通用能力上优于SFT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索持续后训练中学习范式的作用，填补现有研究对SFT和RFT影响的空白。

Method: 在七个多模态任务上实验，使用Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct作为基础模型，分析SFT和RFT的表现。

Result: RFT能保留先验知识并提升通用能力，而SFT导致灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: RFT是持续后训练的稳健范式，并提出改进RFT稳定性的算法。

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for
adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific
and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily
concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter
regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two
core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge
retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising
seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base
model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant
findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to
catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT
inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to
multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the
model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).
Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis
shows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought
reasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit
regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.
Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the
stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the
superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的攻击方法MVMO，用于财务报告操纵，比传统方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不良行为者（主要是陷入困境的公司）有动机操纵财务报告以隐藏困境并获取个人利益。

Method: 引入MVMO攻击方法，通过调整攻击者的搜索方向，找到更多满足条件的攻击方案。

Result: 在约50%的情况下，公司可以将收益虚增100-200%，同时将欺诈评分降低15%。

Conclusion: 通过与律师和专业会计师合作，验证了威胁模型的现实性。

Abstract: Bad actors, primarily distressed firms, have the incentive and desire to
manipulate their financial reports to hide their distress and derive personal
gains. As attackers, these firms are motivated by potentially millions of
dollars and the availability of many publicly disclosed and used financial
modeling frameworks. Existing attack methods do not work on this data due to
anti-correlated objectives that must both be satisfied for the attacker to
succeed. We introduce Maximum Violated Multi-Objective (MVMO) attacks that
adapt the attacker's search direction to find $20\times$ more satisfying
attacks compared to standard attacks. The result is that in $\approx50\%$ of
cases, a company could inflate their earnings by 100-200%, while simultaneously
reducing their fraud scores by 15%. By working with lawyers and professional
accountants, we ensure our threat model is realistic to how such frauds are
performed in practice.

Abstract: We present $\textbf{P}$robabilistically $\textbf{T}$ightened

$\textbf{A}$nalysis ($\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$), a novel framework that combines
over-approximation techniques from LiRPA-based approaches with a sampling-based
method to compute tight intermediate reachable sets. In detail, we show that
with negligible computational overhead, $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$ exploiting the
estimated reachable sets, significantly tightens the lower and upper linear
bounds of a neural network's output, reducing the computational cost of formal
verification tools while providing probabilistic guarantees on verification
soundness. Extensive experiments on standard formal verification benchmarks,
including the International Verification of Neural Networks Competition, show
that our $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$-based verifier improves robustness certificates by
up to 3.31X and 2.26X compared to related work. Importantly, our probabilistic
approach results in a valuable solution for challenging competition entries
where state-of-the-art formal verification methods fail, allowing us to provide
answers with high confidence (i.e., at least 99%).

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在线凸优化中的动态遗憾问题，通过将动态遗憾问题转化为函数空间中的静态遗憾问题，利用RKHS框架实现了最优的动态遗憾保证，并扩展到非线性损失场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线凸优化中，动态遗憾的目标是相对于任意基准序列实现低累积损失。传统方法仅适用于线性损失，而本文旨在通过函数空间的方法扩展至更广泛的损失类型。

Method: 通过将动态遗憾问题转化为函数空间中的静态遗憾问题，并利用RKHS（再生核希尔伯特空间）构造合适的函数空间，实现了对动态遗憾的优化。

Result: 在RKHS框架下，论文恢复了线性损失中的最优动态遗憾保证，并提出了新的无尺度和方向自适应的动态遗憾保证。此外，该方法还适用于非线性损失场景。

Conclusion: 通过RKHS框架，论文不仅实现了动态遗憾的优化，还扩展了其适用范围至非线性损失，同时保证了算法的实际可计算性。

Abstract: We study dynamic regret in online convex optimization, where the objective is
to achieve low cumulative loss relative to an arbitrary benchmark sequence. By
observing that competing with an arbitrary sequence of comparators
$u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}$ in $\mathcal{W}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is equivalent to
competing with a fixed comparator function $u:[1,T]\to \mathcal{W}$, we frame
dynamic regret minimization as a static regret problem in a function space. By
carefully constructing a suitable function space in the form of a Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), our reduction enables us to recover the optimal
$R_{T}(u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}) = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sum_{t}\|u_{t}-u_{t-1}\|T})$
dynamic regret guarantee in the setting of linear losses, and yields new
scale-free and directionally-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees. Moreover,
unlike prior dynamic-to-static reductions -- which are valid only for linear
losses -- our reduction holds for any sequence of losses, allowing us to
recover $\mathcal{O}\big(\|u\|^2+d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)\ln T\big)$ bounds in
exp-concave and improper linear regression settings, where
$d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)$ is a measure of complexity of the RKHS. Despite
working in an infinite-dimensional space, the resulting reduction leads to
algorithms that are computable in practice, due to the reproducing property of
RKHSs.

Abstract: We design and implement AXLearn, a production deep learning system that
facilitates scalable and high-performance training of large deep learning
models. Compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning systems, AXLearn has a
unique focus on modularity and support for heterogeneous hardware
infrastructure. AXLearn's internal interfaces between software components
follow strict encapsulation, allowing different components to be assembled to
facilitate rapid model development and experimentation on heterogeneous compute
infrastructure. We introduce a novel method of quantifying modularity via
Lines-of-Code (LoC)-complexity, which demonstrates how our system maintains
constant complexity as we scale the components in the system, compared to
linear or quadratic complexity in other systems. This allows integrating
features such as Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) into AXLearn across hundred
of modules with just 10 lines of code, compared to hundreds as required in
other systems. At the same time, AXLearn maintains equivalent performance
compared to state-of-the-art training systems. Finally, we share our experience

Method: 提出Stein Diffusion Guidance（SDG），利用Stein变分推理修正近似后验误差，并引入新的运行成本函数。

Result: 在分子生成任务中，SDG显著优于现有训练自由方法。

Conclusion: SDG为扩散模型提供了一种高效且可靠的训练自由引导方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Stochastic optimal control (SOC) has recently emerged as a principled
framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. However, its dependence on
computationally intensive simulations makes it impractical for fast sampling.
In parallel, a class of training-free approaches has been developed that guides
diffusion models using off-the-shelf classifiers on predicted clean samples,
bypassing the need to train classifiers on noisy data. These methods can be
interpreted as approximate SOC schemes, using Tweedie's formula to estimate
diffusion posteriors. In practice, however, such direct approximations can
introduce significant errors, leading to unreliable guidance. In this work, we
unify the strengths of both paradigms by proposing a novel training-free
diffusion guidance framework based on a surrogate stochastic optimal control
objective. We derive a new theoretical bound on the value function that reveals
the necessity of correcting the approximate posteriors to remain faithful to
the true diffusion posterior. To this end, we connect the problem with Stein
variational inference, which seeks the steepest descent direction that
minimizes the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between the two posteriors. Our
method, which we refer to as Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), introduces a
principled correction mechanism and incorporates a novel running cost
functional to enable effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on
challenging molecular generation tasks demonstrate that SDG significantly
outperforms standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential
for broader applications.

Result: 实验表明RepLIn在合成和真实数据集上均能有效减少性能差异，适用于连续和离散潜在变量。

Conclusion: RepLIn能够显式利用干预带来的因果独立性，提升对干预分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning robust discriminative representations of
causally-related latent variables. In addition to observational data, the
training dataset also includes interventional data obtained through targeted
interventions on some of these latent variables to learn representations robust
against the resulting interventional distribution shifts. Existing approaches
treat interventional data like observational data, even when the underlying
causal model is known, and ignore the independence relations that arise from
these interventions. Since these approaches do not fully exploit the causal
relational information resulting from interventions, they learn representations
that produce large disparities in predictive performance on observational and
interventional data, which worsens when the number of interventional training
samples is limited. In this paper, (1) we first identify a strong correlation
between this performance disparity and adherence of the representations to the
independence conditions induced by the interventional causal model. (2) For
linear models, we derive sufficient conditions on the proportion of
interventional data in the training dataset, for which enforcing interventional
independence between representations corresponding to the intervened node and
its non-descendants lowers the error on interventional data. Combining these
insights, (3) we propose RepLIn, a training algorithm to explicitly enforce
this statistical independence during interventions. We demonstrate the utility
of RepLIn on a synthetic dataset and on real image and text datasets on facial
attribute classification and toxicity detection, respectively. Our experiments
show that RepLIn is scalable with the number of nodes in the causal graph and
is suitable to improve the robust representations against interventional
distribution shifts of both continuous and discrete latent variables.

Result: 实验表明MACE-TNP优于传统贝叶斯基线方法。

Conclusion: 元学习为复杂贝叶斯因果推断提供了一种灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In scientific domains -- from biology to the social sciences -- many
questions boil down to \textit{What effect will we observe if we intervene on a
particular variable?} If the causal relationships (e.g.~a causal graph) are
known, it is possible to estimate the intervention distributions. In the
absence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from
the available observational data. However, observational data are often
compatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single
structure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural
uncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior
distribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms.
Unfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with
the number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose
to circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end
model: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process
(MACE-TNP). The model is trained to predict the Bayesian model-averaged
interventional posterior distribution, and its end-to-end nature bypasses the
need for expensive calculations. Empirically, we demonstrate that MACE-TNP
outperforms strong Bayesian baselines. Our work establishes meta-learning as a
flexible and scalable paradigm for approximating complex Bayesian causal
inference, that can be scaled to increasingly challenging settings in the
future.

Result: 实验验证了FACT定理的有效性，FACT-RFM在表格数据上表现优异，并能捕捉特征学习行为。

Conclusion: FACT定理为理解神经网络特征学习提供了新视角，FACT-RFM算法具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: A central challenge in deep learning theory is to understand how neural
networks learn and represent features. To this end, we prove the Features at
Convergence Theorem (FACT), which gives a self-consistency equation that neural
network weights satisfy at convergence when trained with nonzero weight decay.
For each weight matrix $W$, this equation relates the "feature matrix" $W^\top
W$ to the set of input vectors passed into the matrix during forward
propagation and the loss gradients passed through it during backpropagation. We
validate this relation empirically, showing that neural features indeed satisfy
the FACT at convergence. Furthermore, by modifying the "Recursive Feature
Machines" of Radhakrishnan et al. 2024 so that they obey the FACT, we arrive at
a new learning algorithm, FACT-RFM. FACT-RFM achieves high performance on
tabular data and captures various feature learning behaviors that occur in
neural network training, including grokking in modular arithmetic and phase
transitions in learning sparse parities.

Abstract: Many dynamic processes such as telecommunication and transport networks can
be described through discrete time series of graphs. Modelling the dynamics of
such time series enables prediction of graph structure at future time steps,
which can be used in applications such as detection of anomalies. Existing
approaches for graph prediction have limitations such as assuming that the
vertices do not to change between consecutive graphs. To address this, we
propose to exploit time series prediction methods in combination with an
adapted form of flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming method
originating from biochemistry. FBA is adapted to incorporate various
constraints applicable to the scenario of growing graphs. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic datasets (constructed via Preferential Attachment model) and real
datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Conclusion: 分布式多步目标在稀疏奖励领域表现优异，未来可通过模型规划和课程学习进一步提升。

Abstract: Delayed and sparse rewards present a fundamental obstacle for
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which struggle to assign credit for actions
whose benefits emerge many steps later. The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes
this challenge: although frequent small score changes yield immediate feedback,
they often mislead agents into locally optimal but globally suboptimal
strategies. In this work, we introduce a unified, distributional multi-step RL
framework designed to directly optimize long-horizon performance. Using the
open source Gym-2048 environment we develop and compare four agent variants:
standard DQN, PPO, QR-DQN (Quantile Regression DQN), and a novel Horizon-DQN
(H-DQN) that integrates distributional learning, dueling architectures, noisy
networks, prioritized replay, and more. Empirical evaluation reveals a clear
hierarchy in effectiveness: max episode scores improve from 3.988K (DQN) to
5.756K (PPO), 8.66K (QR-DQN), and 18.21K (H-DQN), with H-DQN reaching the 2048
tile. Upon scaling H-DQN it reaches a max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile. These
results demonstrate that distributional, multi-step targets substantially
enhance performance in sparse-reward domains, and they suggest promising
avenues for further gains through model-based planning and curriculum learning.

Conclusion: 该框架通过原型和适配器有效解决了联邦学习中的问题，同时提升了模型的解释性和性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for collaboratively
training machine learning models across distributed data sources while
maintaining privacy. Nevertheless, real-world FL often faces major challenges
including communication overhead during the transfer of large model parameters
and statistical heterogeneity, arising from non-identical independent data
distributions across clients. In this work, we propose an FL framework that 1)
provides inherent interpretations using prototypes, and 2) tackles statistical
heterogeneity by utilising lightweight adapter modules to act as compressed
surrogates of local models and guide clients to achieve generalisation despite
varying client distribution. Each client locally refines its model by aligning
class embeddings toward prototype representations and simultaneously adjust the
lightweight adapter. Our approach replaces the need to communicate entire model
weights with prototypes and lightweight adapters. This design ensures that each
client's model aligns with a globally shared structure while minimising
communication load and providing inherent interpretations. Moreover, we
conducted our experiments on a real-world retinal fundus image dataset, which
provides clinical-site information. We demonstrate inherent interpretable
capabilities and perform a classification task, which shows improvements in
accuracy over baseline algorithms.

Conclusion: FB表示应被用于探索，以提升零样本强化学习的效率，代码已公开。

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning is necessary for extracting optimal policies
in absence of concrete rewards for fast adaptation to future problem settings.
Forward-backward representations (FB) have emerged as a promising method for
learning optimal policies in absence of rewards via a factorization of the
policy occupancy measure. However, up until now, FB and many similar zero-shot
reinforcement learning algorithms have been decoupled from the exploration
problem, generally relying on other exploration algorithms for data collection.
We argue that FB representations should fundamentally be used for exploration
in order to learn more efficiently. With this goal in mind, we design
exploration policies that arise naturally from the FB representation that
minimize the posterior variance of the FB representation, hence minimizing its
epistemic uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that such principled
exploration strategies improve sample complexity of the FB algorithm
considerably in comparison to other exploration methods. Code is publicly
available at https://sites.google.com/view/fbee-url.

Abstract: Data-driven science and computation have advanced immensely to construct
complex functional relationships using trainable parameters. However,
efficiently discovering interpretable and accurate closed-form expressions from
complex dataset remains a challenge. The article presents a novel approach
called Explainable Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Networks or Ex-HiDeNN that
uses an accurate, frugal, fast, separable, and scalable neural architecture
with symbolic regression to discover closed-form expressions from limited
observation. The article presents the two-step Ex-HiDeNN algorithm with a
separability checker embedded in it. The accuracy and efficiency of Ex-HiDeNN
are tested on several benchmark problems, including discerning a dynamical
system from data, and the outcomes are reported. Ex-HiDeNN generally shows
outstanding approximation capability in these benchmarks, producing orders of
magnitude smaller errors compared to reference data and traditional symbolic
regression. Later, Ex-HiDeNN is applied to three engineering applications: a)
discovering a closed-form fatigue equation, b) identification of hardness from
micro-indentation test data, and c) discovering the expression for the yield
surface with data. In every case, Ex-HiDeNN outperformed the reference methods
used in the literature. The proposed method is built upon the foundation and
published works of the authors on Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network
(HiDeNN) and Convolutional HiDeNN. The article also provides a clear idea about
the current limitations and future extensions of Ex-HiDeNN.

Abstract: We present an integrated graph-based neural networks architecture for
predicting campus buildings occupancy and inter-buildings movement at dynamic
temporal resolution that learns traffic flow patterns from Wi-Fi logs combined
with the usage schedules within the buildings. The relative traffic flows are
directly estimated from the WiFi data without assuming the occupant behaviour

as a data-driven graph structure represented by a set of nodes (representing
buildings), connected through a route of edges or links using a novel Graph
Convolution plus LSTM Neural Network (GCLSTM) which has shown remarkable
success in modelling complex patterns. We describe the formulation, model
estimation, interpretability and examine the relative performance of our
proposed model. We also present an illustrative architecture of the models and
apply on real-world WiFi logs collected at the Toronto Metropolitan University
campus. The results of the experiments show that the integrated GCLSTM models
significantly outperform traditional pedestrian flow estimators like the Multi

Abstract: Distributed learning methods have gained substantial momentum in recent
years, with communication overhead often emerging as a critical bottleneck.
Gradient compression techniques alleviate communication costs but involve an
inherent trade-off between the empirical efficiency of biased compressors and
the theoretical guarantees of unbiased compressors. In this work, we introduce
a novel Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) compression scheme that leverages biased
compressors to construct statistically unbiased estimates. This approach
effectively bridges the gap between biased and unbiased methods, combining the
strengths of both. To showcase the versatility of our method, we apply it to
popular compressors, like Top-$k$ and bit-wise compressors, resulting in
enhanced variants. Furthermore, we derive an adaptive version of our approach
to further improve its performance. We validate our method empirically on
distributed deep learning tasks.

Abstract: User growth is a major strategy for consumer internet companies. To optimize
costly marketing campaigns and maximize user engagement, we propose a novel
treatment effect optimization methodology to enhance user growth marketing. By
leveraging deep learning, our algorithm learns from past experiments to
optimize user selection and reward allocation, maximizing campaign impact while
minimizing costs. Unlike traditional prediction methods, our model directly
models uplifts in key business metrics. Further, our deep learning model can
jointly optimize parameters for an aggregated loss function using softmax
gating. Our approach surpasses traditional methods by directly targeting
desired business metrics and demonstrates superior algorithmic flexibility in
handling complex business constraints. Comprehensive evaluations, including
comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques such as R-learner and Causal

Result: 在公共数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为深度学习异质性治疗策略提供了一个通用框架，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: As estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) is increasingly adopted
across a wide range of scientific and industrial applications, the treatment
action space can naturally expand, from a binary treatment variable to a
structured treatment policy. This policy may include several policy factors
such as a continuous treatment intensity variable, or discrete treatment
assignments. From first principles, we derive the formulation for incorporating
multiple treatment policy variables into the functional forms of individual and
average treatment effects. Building on this, we develop a methodology to
directly rank subjects using aggregated HTE functions. In particular, we
construct a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer within a deep learning framework
to incorporate an arbitrary number of factors that satisfies the Naive Bayes
assumption. The factored layer is then applied with continuous treatment
variables, treatment assignment, and direct ranking of aggregated treatment
effect functions. Together, these algorithms build towards a generic framework
for deep learning of heterogeneous treatment policies, and we show their power
to improve performance with public datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) 通过插值多数样本的特征以包含少数样本的特征，减轻模型对捷径的依赖，提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERM 导致模型依赖捷径（输入属性与标签的虚假相关性），影响少数样本的泛化能力。现有方法存在模型特定性、调参困难等问题。

Method: 提出 InterpoLL，通过插值多数样本的表征以包含少数样本的特征，削弱捷径影响。

Result: 在多个自然语言理解任务中，InterpoLL 优于 ERM 和现有方法，提升少数样本泛化且不影响多数样本准确率。

Conclusion: InterpoLL 具有广泛适用性，适用于多种架构，且效果持久。

Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) incentivizes models to exploit shortcuts,
i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels that are
prevalent in the majority of the training data but unrelated to the task at
hand. This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such
correlations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are
model-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to
improve learned representations. To address these issues, we propose
InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of
majority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with
shortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models
to acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples.
Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks
demonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and
state-of-the-art shortcut mitigation methods, without compromising accuracy on
majority examples. Notably, these gains persist across encoder,
encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, demonstrating the method's
broad applicability.

Motivation: 尽管GNNs在图形数据上表现出色，但其硬件加速器的安全性问题被忽视，论文旨在揭示GNNs对硬件故障攻击的脆弱性。

Method: GBFA采用马尔可夫模型预测层执行顺序，并通过梯度排序定位关键位，逐层翻转最小数量的位。

Result: 实验表明，GBFA能显著降低GNNs的预测准确率，例如在Cora数据集上仅翻转最后一层的1位即可使GraphSAGE准确率下降17%。

Conclusion: 层感知攻击策略对GNNs的安全性至关重要，GBFA展示了硬件故障攻击的实际威胁。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful machine learning
method for graph-structured data. A plethora of hardware accelerators has been
introduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.
However, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally
overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to
hardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output
by modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory
device. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware
bit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight
gradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of
bits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is
created to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted
from memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a
specific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the
selected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node
classification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that
GBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its
impact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a
layer-aware attack strategy in GNNs. For example, GBFA degrades GraphSAGE's
prediction accuracy by 17% on the Cora dataset with only a single bit flip in
the last layer.

Conclusion: 本文为GCN中跳跃连接和图稀疏化的理论分析提供了首个框架，并通过实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Jumping connections enable Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to overcome
over-smoothing, while graph sparsification reduces computational demands by
selecting a sub-matrix of the graph adjacency matrix during neighborhood
aggregation. Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical
success across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the
generalization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring
either graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the
first learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping
connections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the
generalization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest
achievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the
proposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification
maintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges
that support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections
lead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a
two-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified
matrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer. To the
best of our knowledge, this marks the first theoretical characterization of
jumping connections' role in sparsification requirements. We validate our
theoretical results on benchmark datasets in deep GCNs.

Conclusion: LSC-GNN能提升噪声关系结构下的预测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with noisy edges. We propose
Latent Space Constrained Graph Neural Networks (LSC-GNN) to incorporate
external "clean" links and guide embeddings of a noisy target graph. We train
two encoders--one on the full graph (target plus external edges) and another on
a regularization graph excluding the target's potentially noisy links--then
penalize discrepancies between their latent representations. This constraint
steers the model away from overfitting spurious edges. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs in graphs
subjected to moderate noise. We extend LSC-GNN to heterogeneous graphs and
validate it on a small protein-metabolite network, where metabolite-protein
interactions reduce noise in protein co-occurrence data. Our results highlight
LSC-GNN's potential to boost predictive performance and interpretability in
settings with noisy relational structures.

Conclusion: 该框架通过智能融合辅助信息，有效提升了负载估计的性能，且无需推理时的搬运风格标签。

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to ergonomic risk
assessment in manual material handling, particularly for estimating carried
load from gait motion data collected from wearable sensors. However, existing
approaches often rely on direct mappings from loaded gait to hand load,
limiting generalization and predictive accuracy. In this study, we propose an
enhanced load estimation framework that incorporates auxiliary information,
including baseline gait patterns during unloaded walking and carrying style.
While baseline gait can be automatically captured by wearable sensors and is
thus readily available at inference time, carrying style typically requires
manual labeling and is often unavailable during deployment. Our model
integrates deep latent variable modeling with temporal convolutional networks
and bi-directional cross-attention to capture gait dynamics and fuse loaded and
unloaded gait patterns. Guided by domain knowledge, the model is designed to
estimate load magnitude conditioned on carrying style, while eliminating the
need for carrying style labels at inference time. Experiments using real-world
data collected from inertial measurement units attached to participants
demonstrate substantial accuracy gains from incorporating auxiliary information
and highlight the importance of explicit fusion mechanisms over naive feature
concatenation.

Result: 在网格世界和Craftax环境中，该算法能更好地预测人类行为，并提升人工代理在新任务中的表现。

Conclusion: Multitask Preplay是一种可扩展的理论，能显著提升人工代理在复杂多任务环境中的性能。

Abstract: Humans can pursue a near-infinite variety of tasks, but typically can only
pursue a small number at the same time. We hypothesize that humans leverage
experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other tasks that were
accessible but not pursued. We formalize this idea as Multitask Preplay, a
novel algorithm that replays experience on one task as the starting point for
"preplay" -- counterfactual simulation of an accessible but unpursued task.
Preplay is used to learn a predictive representation that can support fast,
adaptive task performance later on. We first show that, compared to traditional
planning and predictive representation methods, multitask preplay better
predicts how humans generalize to tasks that were accessible but not pursued in
a small grid-world, even when people didn't know they would need to generalize
to these tasks. We then show these predictions generalize to Craftax, a
partially observable 2D Minecraft environment. Finally, we show that Multitask
Preplay enables artificial agents to learn behaviors that transfer to novel
Craftax worlds sharing task co-occurrence structure. These findings demonstrate
that Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory of how humans counterfactually
learn and generalize across multiple tasks; endowing artificial agents with the
same capacity can significantly improve their performance in challenging
multitask environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training
data. This phenomenon raises critical questions about model behavior, privacy
risks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these
concerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape
of memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and
mitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication,
training dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization.
In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction,
membership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness
in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we
also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and
ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data
cleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while
highlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful
memorization with utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
current state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and
performance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work.

Abstract: Optical computing holds promise for high-speed, energy-efficient information
processing, with diffractive optical networks emerging as a flexible platform
for implementing task-specific transformations. A challenge, however, is the
effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is
hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their
inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in
situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the
physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by
slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited
measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning
approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training
of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement
data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster
convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ
learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser,
holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image
classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance.
Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts
for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system
knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under
realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning
approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical
systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.

Abstract: In this work we propose a unified Fourier Spectral Transformer network that
integrates the strengths of classical spectral methods and attention based

differential equations, we use high precision numerical solvers to generate
training data and use a Transformer network to model the evolution of the
spectral coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the
two dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the one dimensional
Burgers' equation. The results show that our spectral Transformer can achieve
highly accurate long term predictions even with limited training data, better
than traditional numerical methods and machine learning methods in forecasting
future flow dynamics. The proposed framework generalizes well to unseen data,
bringing a promising paradigm for real time prediction and control of complex
dynamical systems.

recall across environments, with computational overhead under 5%. Through
controlled experiments varying reward function properties, we demonstrate that
reward density and alignment with true objectives significantly impact hacking
frequency ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 1.24$). We validate our approach through
three simulated application studies representing recommendation systems,
competitive gaming, and robotic control scenarios. Our mitigation techniques
reduce hacking frequency by up to 54.6% in controlled scenarios, though we find
these trade-offs are more challenging in practice due to concept drift, false
positive costs, and adversarial adaptation. All detection algorithms, datasets,
and experimental protocols are publicly available to support reproducible
research in RL safety.

Abstract: Graph learning has rapidly evolved into a critical subfield of machine
learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Its development began with early
graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph
neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable
architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI,
explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of
graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is
significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships
that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting
real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to
recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like
scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and
trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey
provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key
dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable,
and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for
efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal
dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph
samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We
also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure
responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and
discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and
other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey
serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to
navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of graph learning.

Abstract: Canine gait analysis using wearable inertial sensors is gaining attention in
veterinary clinical settings, as it provides valuable insights into a range of
mobility impairments. Neurological and orthopedic conditions cannot always be
easily distinguished even by experienced clinicians. The current study explored
and developed a deep learning approach using inertial sensor readings to assess
whether neurological and orthopedic gait could facilitate gait analysis. Our
investigation focused on optimizing both performance and generalizability in
distinguishing between these gait abnormalities. Variations in sensor
configurations, assessment protocols, and enhancements to deep learning model
architectures were further suggested. Using a dataset of 29 dogs, our proposed
approach achieved 96% accuracy in the multiclass classification task
(healthy/orthopedic/neurological) and 82% accuracy in the binary classification
task (healthy/non-healthy) when generalizing to unseen dogs. Our results
demonstrate the potential of inertial-based deep learning models to serve as a
practical and objective diagnostic and clinical aid to differentiate gait
assessment in orthopedic and neurological conditions.

Abstract: The integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
presents a compelling pathway for training more powerful, large-scale
artificial intelligence models (LAMs) on decentralized data while preserving
privacy. However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured
LAMs is hindered by significant system-level challenges, particularly in
managing the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the
sophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This
article highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust
quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically
considers varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load
balancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent
client-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global
expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these
systemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training
mechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way
for the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in
edge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency.

TL;DR: AutoTriton是一个基于强化学习的模型，用于自动优化Triton编程中的关键参数，减少手动调优的负担，并实现高性能内核生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习内核开发需要跨硬件优化计算单元，手动调优关键参数（如分块大小和内存访问模式）效率低下且阻碍性能优化。

Method: AutoTriton结合监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL），使用GRPO算法和混合奖励策略优化Triton编程能力。

Result: 实验表明，AutoTriton在性能上媲美主流大模型（如Claude-4-Sonnet和DeepSeek-R1-0528），并验证了各模块（SFT、RL、奖励设计）的关键作用。

Conclusion: AutoTriton展示了强化学习在自动生成高性能内核中的潜力，为构建更高效的AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Kernel development in deep learning requires optimizing computational units
across hardware while balancing memory management, parallelism, and
hardware-specific optimizations through extensive empirical tuning. Although
domain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting
low-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such
as tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation,
creating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In
this work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton
programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming
expertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based
reward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming
ability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of
TritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves
performance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet
and DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial
role of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,
and the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for
automatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance
kernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an
important foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code
will be available at https://github.com/AI9Stars/AutoTriton.

Result: 在三个在线移动代理基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MobileGUI-RL框架显著提升了GUI代理的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of vision-based GUI agents designed to
automate everyday mobile and web tasks. These agents interpret raw GUI
screenshots and autonomously decide where to click, scroll, or type, which
bypasses handcrafted rules and app-specific APIs. However, most existing
methods trained GUI agent in the offline environment using pre-collected
trajectories. This approach limits scalability, causes overfitting to specific
UI templates, and leads to brittle policies when faced with unseen environment.
We present MobileGUI-RL, a scalable framework that trains GUI agent in online
environment. MobileGUI-RL contains two key components. It (i) synthesizes a
curriculum of learnable tasks through self-exploration and filtering, and (ii)
adapts GRPO to GUI navigation with trajectory-aware advantages and composite
rewards that balance task success and execution efficiency. Experiments on
three online mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent gains, validating the
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: With the emergence of compute-intensive and delay-sensitive applications in
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising
complement for vehicular edge computing due to the high mobility and flexible
deployment. However, the existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies are
insufficient in coordinating heterogeneous computing resources and adapting to
dynamic network conditions. Hence, this paper proposes a dual-layer
UAV-assisted edge computing architecture based on partial offloading, composed
of the relay capability of high-altitude UAVs and the computing support of
low-altitude UAVs. The proposed architecture enables efficient integration and
coordination of heterogeneous resources. A joint optimization problem is
formulated to minimize the system delay and energy consumption while ensuring
the task completion rate. To solve the high-dimensional decision problem, we
reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a hierarchical
offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm. The method
decouples global and local decisions, where the global decisions integrate
offloading ratios and trajectory planning into continuous actions, while the
local scheduling is handled via designing a priority-based mechanism.
Simulations are conducted and demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms several baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and
convergence speed, showing strong robustness and applicability in dynamic
vehicular environments.

Abstract: AI-based methods have revolutionized atmospheric forecasting, with recent
successes in medium-range forecasting spurring the development of climate
foundation models. Accurate modeling of complex atmospheric dynamics at high
spatial resolutions and longer lead times requires large neural networks and
gigabyte-sized data samples, making accelerator memory and I/O-bandwidth the
bottlenecks for model training. We introduce WeatherMixer, a
multi-layer-perceptron-based architecture whose workload scales linearly with
input size, allowing the model to learn global weather phenomena at accuracies
similar to numerical weather prediction. To cope with the computational demand,
we propose Jigsaw, a novel model parallelization scheme that employs both
domain and tensor parallelism, eliminating memory redundancy. Jigsaw exceeds
state-of-the-art performance in strong scaling in compute-communication-limited
systems and achieves superscalar weak scaling in I/O-bandwidth-limited systems.
We scale training to 256 GPUs, reaching peak performances of 9 and 11 PFLOPs,
23% and 28% of theoretical peaks, achieving 68% and 72% scaling efficiency
versus 51% without model parallelism.

Abstract: Cardiac diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
worldwide, which requires accurate and timely diagnostic strategies. In this
study, we introduce an innovative approach that combines deep learning image
registration with physics-informed regularization to predict the biomechanical
properties of moving cardiac tissues and extract features for disease
classification. We utilize the energy strain formulation of Neo-Hookean
material to model cardiac tissue deformations, optimizing the deformation field
while ensuring its physical and biomechanical coherence. This explainable
approach not only improves image registration accuracy, but also provides
insights into the underlying biomechanical processes of the cardiac tissues.
Evaluation on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset achieved
Dice scores of 0.945 for the left ventricular cavity, 0.908 for the right
ventricular cavity, and 0.905 for the myocardium. Subsequently, we estimate the
local strains within the moving heart and extract a detailed set of features
used for cardiovascular disease classification. We evaluated five
classification algorithms, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support
Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and Nearest Neighbour, and identified the
most relevant features using a feature selection algorithm. The best performing
classifier obtained a classification accuracy of 98% in the training set and
100% in the test set of the ACDC dataset. By integrating explainable artificial
intelligence, this method empowers clinicians with a transparent understanding
of the model's predictions based on cardiac mechanics, while also significantly
improving the accuracy and reliability of cardiac disease diagnosis, paving the
way for more personalized and effective patient care.

Motivation: 解决少样本域适应中因缺乏大型验证数据集而难以调参的问题，以及模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 训练多个独立适配器，通过平均输出提升性能，并将参数重新参数化为单一适配器。

Result: 新模型性能更高，对分布偏移更鲁棒，且对关键超参数不敏感。

Conclusion: Soup-Adapter有效解决了调参和鲁棒性问题，并首次探索了DINOv2的适配器技术。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle two fundamental problems in few-shot domain
adaptation of foundation models. First, hyperparameter tuning is often
impractical due to the lack of large validation datasets. Second, model
robustness under distribution shifts where test time data deviates slightly
from training distributions, remains a concern. We show that by training
multiple independent adapters and averaging their outputs, the new model has a
higher performance and is more robust to distribution shifts compared to any
individual adapter. This improvement holds even when the adapters are trained
with diverse hyperparameters sampled from a wide range, resulting in varied
individual performance. Consequently, our method addresses both of the problems
described above. The ensemble is also significantly less sensitive to the
residual ratio, a critical hyperparameter of CLIP-Adapter. Since the ensemble
can be reparameterized to a single adapter again using a principled
concatenation of the parameters, we refer to our method as Soup-Adapter. This
is also the first study to explore CLIP adapter-style techniques for DINOv2 and
to directly compare them with CLIP in this setting.

Result: 揭示了模型决策背后的潜在电路和信息流，帮助识别虚假相关性并增强模型可信度。

Conclusion: 该框架模型无关且可扩展，有助于深入理解深度学习模型在数据集偏差下的泛化行为。

Abstract: While concept-based interpretability methods have traditionally focused on
local explanations of neural network predictions, we propose a novel framework
and interactive tool that extends these methods into the domain of mechanistic
interpretability. Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by
analyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge,
interact, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work
that isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically
quantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing
latent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key
innovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis
with a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a
structured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class
relationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model
trustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to
a deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in
the presence of dataset biases. The demonstration is available at

Result: 实验表明PAFDG在真实数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAFDG成功解决了FairDG问题，实现了更好的效用-公平性权衡。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical
challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on
minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering
algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for
domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to
unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem
of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected
risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual
information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in
multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These
bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic
perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal
Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the
FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto
optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that
PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing
methods.

Abstract: Tabular data in relational databases represents a significant portion of
industrial data. Hence, analyzing and interpreting tabular data is of utmost
importance. Application tasks on tabular data are manifold and are often not
specified when setting up an industrial database. To address this, we present a
novel framework for generating universal, i.e., task-independent embeddings of
tabular data for performing downstream tasks without predefined targets. Our
method transforms tabular data into a graph structure, leverages Graph
Auto-Encoders to create entity embeddings, which are subsequently aggregated to
obtain embeddings for each table row, i.e., each data sample. This two-step
approach has the advantage that unseen samples, consisting of similar entities,
can be embedded without additional training. Downstream tasks such as
regression, classification or outlier detection, can then be performed by
applying a distance-based similarity measure in the embedding space.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing universal tabular data embedding
techniques.

Abstract: This survey provides a comparative analysis of feature-based and GAN-based
approaches to learning from demonstrations, with a focus on the structure of
reward functions and their implications for policy learning. Feature-based
methods offer dense, interpretable rewards that excel at high-fidelity motion
imitation, yet often require sophisticated representations of references and
struggle with generalization in unstructured settings. GAN-based methods, in
contrast, use implicit, distributional supervision that enables scalability and
adaptation flexibility, but are prone to training instability and coarse reward
signals. Recent advancements in both paradigms converge on the importance of
structured motion representations, which enable smoother transitions,
controllable synthesis, and improved task integration. We argue that the
dichotomy between feature-based and GAN-based methods is increasingly nuanced:
rather than one paradigm dominating the other, the choice should be guided by
task-specific priorities such as fidelity, diversity, interpretability, and
adaptability. This work outlines the algorithmic trade-offs and design
considerations that underlie method selection, offering a framework for
principled decision-making in learning from demonstrations.

Result: 实验表明，D2C在多种条件下显著加速训练，仅用0.8%数据即可在40k步内达到FID 4.3。

Conclusion: D2C是首个针对扩散模型的数据集压缩方法，有效降低训练成本并保持高质量生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative
tasks, but training them remains highly resource-intensive, often requiring
millions of images and many days of GPU computation. From a data-centric
perspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation
as a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a
"synthetic" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original
dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced
cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate
dataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on
training discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a
novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two
phases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse
subset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach
phase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual
representations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments
across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that
our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with
dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the
SiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID
score of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data.

Abstract: Noisy labels pose significant challenges for AI model training in veterinary
medicine. This study examines expert assessment ambiguity in canine
auscultation data, highlights the negative impact of label noise on
classification performance, and introduces methods for label noise reduction.
To evaluate whether label noise can be minimized by incorporating multiple
expert opinions, a dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated
regarding the intensity of holosystolic heart murmurs caused by Myxomatous
Mitral Valve Disease (MMVD). The expert opinions facilitated the selection of
70 high-quality HSR, resulting in a noise-reduced dataset. By leveraging
individual heart cycles, the training data was expanded and classification
robustness was enhanced. The investigation encompassed training and evaluating
three classification algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. While
AdaBoost and Random Forest exhibited reasonable performances, XGBoost
demonstrated notable improvements in classification accuracy. All algorithms
showed significant improvements in classification accuracy due to the applied
label noise reduction, most notably XGBoost. Specifically, for the detection of
mild heart murmurs, sensitivity increased from 37.71% to 90.98% and specificity
from 76.70% to 93.69%. For the moderate category, sensitivity rose from 30.23%
to 55.81% and specificity from 64.56% to 97.19%. In the loud/thrilling
category, sensitivity and specificity increased from 58.28% to 95.09% and from
84.84% to 89.69%, respectively. These results highlight the importance of
minimizing label noise to improve classification algorithms for the detection
of canine heart murmurs. Index Terms: AI diagnosis, canine heart disease, heart

### [62] [Simple Convergence Proof of Adam From a Sign-like Descent Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05966)
*Hanyang Peng,Shuang Qin,Yue Yu,Fangqing Jiang,Hui Wang,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的Adam优化器解释方法，将其视为符号类优化器，简化了收敛性分析，并证明了其在更弱假设下的最优收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Adam在深度神经网络训练中表现优异，但其理论收敛分析仍不完善，现有方法需要强假设且复杂。

Method: 将Adam重新解释为符号类优化器，简化了收敛性分析，并在弱假设下证明了其最优收敛速率。

Result: 证明了Adam在广义p-仿射方差和(L0, L1, q)-平滑性假设下达到最优收敛速率O(1/T^{1/4})。

Conclusion: 新方法不仅简化了理论分析，还提供了动量在收敛中的作用及学习率调参的实践指导，弥合了理论与实践的差距。

Abstract: Adam is widely recognized as one of the most effective optimizers for
training deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its remarkable empirical success,
its theoretical convergence analysis remains unsatisfactory. Existing works
predominantly interpret Adam as a preconditioned stochastic gradient descent
with momentum (SGDM), formulated as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t -
\frac{\gamma_t}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ \bm{m}_t$. This perspective
necessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy
and opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In
contrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like
optimizer, expressed as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t - \gamma_t
\frac{|\bm{m}_t|}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ {\rm Sign}(\bm{m}_t)$. This
reformulation significantly simplifies the convergence analysis. For the first
time, with some mild conditions, we prove that Adam achieves the optimal rate
of ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}})$ rather than the previous ${\cal O}
\left(\frac{\ln T}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ under weak assumptions of the
generalized $p$-affine variance and $(L_0, L_1, q)$-smoothness, without
dependence on the model dimensionality or the numerical stability parameter
$\epsilon$. Additionally, our theoretical analysis provides new insights into
the role of momentum as a key factor ensuring convergence and offers practical
guidelines for tuning learning rates in Adam, further bridging the gap between
theory and practice.

Abstract: KnowIt (Knowledge discovery in time series data) is a flexible framework for
building deep time series models and interpreting them. It is implemented as a
Python toolkit, with source code and documentation available from
https://must-deep-learning.github.io/KnowIt. It imposes minimal assumptions
about task specifications and decouples the definition of dataset, deep neural

architectures, and the definition of different interpretability paradigms while
maintaining on-the-fly modeling and interpretation of different aspects of a
user's own time series data. KnowIt aims to provide an environment where users
can perform knowledge discovery on their own complex time series data through
building powerful deep learning models and explaining their behavior. With
ongoing development, collaboration and application our goal is to make this a
platform to progress this underexplored field and produce a trusted tool for
deep time series modeling.

Conclusion: 为多视图中融合学习的通用优势研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) setting presents significant
challenges in various applications where the feature dimension far exceeds the
number of available samples. This paper introduces a universal approach for
learning in HDLSS setting using multi-view mid fusion techniques. It shows how
existing mid fusion multi-view methods perform well in an HDLSS setting even if
no inherent views are provided. Three view construction methods are proposed
that split the high-dimensional feature vectors into smaller subsets, each
representing a different view. Extensive experimental validation across
model-types and learning tasks confirm the effectiveness and generalization of
the approach. We believe the work in this paper lays the foundation for further
research into the universal benefits of multi-view mid fusion learning.

Motivation: 机器学习在科学和工程应用中因训练数据有限或质量低而表现不佳，尤其是在地下水流动与热传输这类复杂问题中。传统数值模拟成本高，而纯数据驱动模型难以准确预测敏感的平流过程。

Method: 采用LGCNN方法，结合轻量级数值替代模型（全局）和卷积神经网络（局部），分别处理地下水速度场和热扩散过程。

Conclusion: LGCNN方法有效解决了地下水流动与热传输问题，兼具计算效率和准确性，适用于复杂场景，且代码和模型已公开以确保可重复性。

Abstract: Machine learning methods often struggle with real-world applications in
science and engineering due to limited or low-quality training data. In this
work, the example of groundwater flow with heat transport is considered; this
corresponds to an advection-diffusion process under heterogeneous flow
conditions, that is, spatially distributed material parameters and heat
sources. Classical numerical simulations are costly and challenging due to high
spatio-temporal resolution requirements and large domains. While often
computationally more efficient, purely data-driven surrogate models face
difficulties, particularly in predicting the advection process, which is highly
sensitive to input variations and involves long-range spatial interactions.
Therefore, in this work, a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)
approach is introduced. It combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for the
transport process (global) with convolutional neural networks for the
groundwater velocity and heat diffusion processes (local). With the LGCNN, a
city-wide subsurface temperature field is modeled, involving a heterogeneous
groundwater flow field and one hundred groundwater heat pump injection points
forming interacting heat plumes over long distances. The model is first
systematically analyzed based on random subsurface input fields. Then, the
model is trained on a handful of cut-outs from a real-world subsurface map of
the Munich region in Germany, and it scales to larger cut-outs without
retraining. All datasets, our code, and trained models are published for
reproducibility.

TL;DR: 结构化状态空间模型（SSM）因其适合处理长序列和固定内存占用的特点，成为边缘计算设备的理想选择。本文通过量化感知训练（QAT）显著降低SSM复杂度，并探讨其在模拟内存计算（AIMC）芯片上的应用。

Motivation: SSM在边缘计算设备上的潜力尚未充分挖掘，尤其是在模拟内存计算硬件上的量化效果未被深入研究。

Method: 采用量化感知训练（QAT）优化SSM，分析模型大小与数值精度的关系，并研究其对模拟噪声的鲁棒性和结构剪枝的影响。

Result: QAT将SSM复杂度降低两个数量级，增强了对模拟噪声的鲁棒性，并实现了结构剪枝。最终在忆阻器模拟内存计算硬件上成功部署。

Conclusion: QAT显著提升了SSM在边缘计算设备上的效率和适用性，尤其是在模拟内存计算硬件上的表现优异。

Abstract: Structured State Space models (SSM) have recently emerged as a new class of
deep learning models, particularly well-suited for processing long sequences.
Their constant memory footprint, in contrast to the linearly scaling memory
demands of Transformers, makes them attractive candidates for deployment on
resource-constrained edge-computing devices. While recent works have explored
the effect of quantization-aware training (QAT) on SSMs, they typically do not
address its implications for specialized edge hardware, for example, analog
in-memory computing (AIMC) chips. In this work, we demonstrate that QAT can
significantly reduce the complexity of SSMs by up to two orders of magnitude
across various performance metrics. We analyze the relation between model size
and numerical precision, and show that QAT enhances robustness to analog noise
and enables structural pruning. Finally, we integrate these techniques to
deploy SSMs on a memristive analog in-memory computing substrate and highlight
the resulting benefits in terms of computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出CoRE方法，通过分析推理轨迹的几何特性，实现无标签自评估，减少冗余推理步骤，提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）存在过度思考现象，导致推理效率低下，需要一种无外部标签的自评估方法。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding（CoRE），利用潜在空间中的隐藏状态分析推理轨迹的几何特性，并开发CoRE-Eval框架动态终止冗余推理。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，CoRE-Eval减少推理步骤13.7%-33.2%，同时提升准确率约10%，32B模型在AIME基准上达到70.0%准确率。

Conclusion: CoRE方法有效提升LRMs的元认知能力，显著优化推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
domains like mathematics and program synthesis. Despite their strong
performance, LRMs often exhibit overthinking -- excessive and redundant
reasoning steps that introduce inefficiencies during inference. This phenomenon
raises an important question for LRM self-evaluation: How can a model
autonomously assess the correctness of its own reasoning trajectory without
external labels? To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding
(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free
self-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance
metacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the
geometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant
reasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to
repetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration. Leveraging this insight, we
further introduce a training-free, label-free self-evaluation framework,
CoRE-Eval, to detect such patterns and dynamically determine whether to
terminate reasoning early. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME) and across model sizes from 7B to 32B
demonstrate that CoRE-Eval reduces chain-of-thought length by 13.7% to 33.2%
while improving answer accuracy by around 10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on the
challenging AIME benchmark with the 32B model.

Result: 在MuJoCo基准和四足机器人上验证了UARL的有效性，包括可靠的OOD检测、性能提升和样本效率改进。

Conclusion: UARL为强化学习在现实世界的安全部署提供了一种有效方法，避免了直接交互的风险。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world involves
significant challenges, including distribution shifts, safety concerns, and the
impracticality of direct interactions during policy refinement. Existing
methods, such as domain randomization (DR) and off-dynamics RL, enhance policy
robustness by direct interaction with the target domain, an inherently unsafe
practice. We propose Uncertainty-Aware RL (UARL), a novel framework that
prioritizes safety during training by addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)
detection and policy adaptation without requiring direct interactions in target
domain. UARL employs an ensemble of critics to quantify policy uncertainty and
incorporates progressive environmental randomization to prepare the policy for
diverse real-world conditions. By iteratively refining over high-uncertainty
regions of the state space in simulated environments, UARL enhances robust
generalization to the target domain without explicitly training on it. We
evaluate UARL on MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot, demonstrating its
effectiveness in reliable OOD detection, improved performance, and enhanced
sample efficiency compared to baselines.

Motivation: 解决零阶优化中梯度信息不可用或计算成本高的问题，同时利用二阶信息加速收敛。

Method: 在随机选择的二维子空间中拟合二次多项式估计Hessian矩阵，并采用周期性子空间切换策略减少函数查询成本。

Result: 在八个基准数据集（包括逻辑回归和深度神经网络训练任务）上，ZO-SAH比现有零阶方法收敛更快。

Conclusion: ZO-SAH通过高效利用二阶信息，显著提升了零阶优化的性能，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization addresses problems where gradient information is
inaccessible or impractical to compute. While most existing methods rely on
first-order approximations, incorporating second-order (curvature) information
can, in principle, significantly accelerate convergence. However, the high cost
of function evaluations required to estimate Hessian matrices often limits
practical applicability. We present the subspace-based approximate Hessian
(ZO-SAH) method, a zeroth-order optimization algorithm that mitigates these
costs by focusing on randomly selected two-dimensional subspaces. Within each
subspace, ZO-SAH estimates the Hessian by fitting a quadratic polynomial to the
objective function and extracting its second-order coefficients. To further
reduce function-query costs, ZO-SAH employs a periodic subspace-switching
strategy that reuses function evaluations across optimization steps.
Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including logistic regression and deep
neural network training tasks, demonstrate that ZO-SAH achieves significantly
faster convergence than existing zeroth-order methods.

Abstract: Link prediction infers missing or future relations between graph nodes, based
on connection patterns. Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are
typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between
entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that
integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer
discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization
(BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix
factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a
46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).
These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current
and potential applications.
  An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with
probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto
coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also,
missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials,
suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our
method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known
superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the
superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in
a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific
literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific
documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating
from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new
hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive
Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 论文通过帧理论方法分析了卷积层的混叠效应，提出了高效优化目标，并揭示了随机核层的混叠行为，为稳定性分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Using a stride in a convolutional layer inherently introduces aliasing, which
has implications for numerical stability and statistical generalization. While
techniques such as the parametrizations via paraunitary systems have been used
to promote orthogonal convolution and thus ensure Parseval stability, a general
analysis of aliasing and its effects on the stability has not been done in this
context. In this article, we adapt a frame-theoretic approach to describe
aliasing in convolutional layers with 1D kernels, leading to practical
estimates for stability bounds and characterizations of Parseval stability,
that are tailored to take short kernel sizes into account. From this, we derive
two computationally very efficient optimization objectives that promote
Parseval stability via systematically suppressing aliasing. Finally, for layers
with random kernels, we derive closed-form expressions for the expected value
and variance of the terms that describe the aliasing effects, revealing
fundamental insights into the aliasing behavior at initialization.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for partial optimization of the connections in
Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs). Our training method utilizes a

the connection with highest merit, after which the gate-types are selected. We
show that the connection-optimized LGNs outperform standard fixed-connection

a fraction of the number of logic gates. When training all connections, we
demonstrate that 8000 simple logic gates are sufficient to achieve over 98% on
the MNIST data set. Additionally, we show that our network has 24 times fewer
gates, while performing better on the MNIST data set compared to standard fully
connected LGNs. As such, our work shows a pathway towards fully trainable
Boolean logic.

Abstract: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to
irrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This
degrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and
retrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that
differential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their
effectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether
these techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to
Mamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that
achieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a
naive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires
careful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel
differential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling
benchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior
performance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
and empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that
our approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based
models. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: The evolution of wireless communication systems requires flexible,
energy-efficient, and cost-effective antenna technologies. Pinching antennas
(PAs), which can dynamically control electromagnetic wave propagation through
binary activation states, have recently emerged as a promising candidate. In
this work, we investigate the problem of optimally selecting a subset of
fixed-position PAs to activate in a waveguide, when the aim is to maximize the
communication rate at a user terminal. Due to the complex interplay between
antenna activation, waveguide-induced phase shifts, and power division, this
problem is formulated as a combinatorial fractional 0-1 quadratic program. To
efficiently solve this challenging problem, we use neural network architectures
of varying complexity to learn activation policies directly from data,
leveraging spatial features and signal structure. Furthermore, we incorporate
user location uncertainty into our training and evaluation pipeline to simulate
realistic deployment conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed models.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了逻辑老虎机问题的分析框架，为多分类场景提供了更优的理论保证。

Abstract: We consider the multinomial logistic bandit problem, a variant of generalized
linear bandits where a learner interacts with an environment by selecting
actions to maximize expected rewards based on probabilistic feedback from
multiple possible outcomes. In the binary setting, recent work has focused on
understanding the impact of the non-linearity of the logistic model (Faury et
al., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021). They introduced a problem-dependent constant
$\kappa_*$, that may be exponentially large in some problem parameters and
which is captured by the derivative of the sigmoid function. It encapsulates
the non-linearity and improves existing regret guarantees over $T$ rounds from
$\smash{O(d\sqrt{T})}$ to $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$, where $d$ is the
dimension of the parameter space. We extend their analysis to the multinomial
logistic bandit framework, making it suitable for complex applications with
more than two choices, such as reinforcement learning or recommender systems.
To achieve this, we extend the definition of $\kappa_*$ to the multinomial
setting and propose an efficient algorithm that leverages the problem's
non-linearity. Our method yields a problem-dependent regret bound of order $
\smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{{T}/{\kappa_*}})} $, where $K$ is the
number of actions and $\kappa_* \ge 1$. This improves upon the best existing
guarantees of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{T} )} $.
Moreover, we provide a $\smash{ \Omega(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$ lower-bound,
showing that our dependence on $\kappa_*$ is optimal.

*Agnideep Aich,Ashit Baran Aich,Dipak C. Jain*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP)的新框架，用于构建金融时间序列的预测区间，具有有限样本有效性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融时间序列具有非平稳性、波动聚类和制度转换等特征，传统方法依赖严格的参数假设，难以适应这些复杂特性。

Method: TCP结合分位数回归和保形校准层，通过衰减学习率在线适应，融合统计与机器学习范式。

Result: 在股票、加密货币和大宗商品等数据集上，TCP生成的预测区间更窄且覆盖率优于或与现有方法相当，尤其在波动剧烈时表现突出。

Conclusion: TCP为金融不确定性量化提供了一种无需分布假设、自适应且可解释的解决方案，推动了统计推断与机器学习在金融领域的结合。

Abstract: We propose Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP), a novel framework for
constructing prediction intervals in financial time-series with guaranteed
finite-sample validity. TCP integrates quantile regression with a conformal
calibration layer that adapts online via a decaying learning rate. This hybrid
design bridges statistical and machine learning paradigms, enabling TCP to
accommodate non-stationarity, volatility clustering, and regime shifts which
are hallmarks of real-world asset returns, without relying on rigid parametric
assumptions. We benchmark TCP against established methods including GARCH,
Historical Simulation, and static Quantile Regression across equities (S&P
500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Empirical results show
that TCP consistently delivers sharper intervals with competitive or superior
coverage, particularly in high-volatility regimes. Our study underscores TCP's
strength in navigating the coverage-sharpness tradeoff, a central challenge in
modern risk forecasting. Overall, TCP offers a distribution-free, adaptive, and
interpretable alternative for financial uncertainty quantification, advancing
the interface between statistical inference and machine learning in finance.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful
tool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the
score function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to
the target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a
variety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score
matching, Hyv\"arien's method, or Schr\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we
derive an exact, closed form, expression for the score function for a broad
class of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern
stochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint
operators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type
formula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written
entirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all
Malliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its
practical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work
offers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in
generative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for
complex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader
classes of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the
development of score-based diffusion generative models.

Conclusion: 可引出的IP属性实际上是最大贝叶斯风险分布对应的标准属性。

Abstract: Property elicitation studies which attributes of a probability distribution
can be determined by minimising a risk. We investigate a generalisation of
property elicitation to imprecise probabilities (IP). This investigation is
motivated by multi-distribution learning, which takes the classical machine
learning paradigm of minimising a single risk over a (precise) probability and
replaces it with $\Gamma$-maximin risk minimization over an IP. We provide
necessary conditions for elicitability of a IP-property. Furthermore, we
explain what an elicitable IP-property actually elicits through Bayes pairs --
the elicited IP-property is the corresponding standard property of the maximum
Bayes risk distribution.

Result: 平滑处理（SBoN）能有效缓解奖励过优化问题，尤其在代理奖励质量较低时。

Conclusion: SBoN在理论和实践中均表现出色，尤其在代理奖励不理想时更具优势。

Abstract: A simple yet effective method for inference-time alignment of generative
models is Best-of-$N$ (BoN), where $N$ outcomes are sampled from a reference
policy, evaluated using a proxy reward model, and the highest-scoring one is
selected. While prior work argues that BoN is almost optimal in reward vs KL
tradeoffs, the effectiveness of BoN depends critically on the quality of the
proxy reward model used for selection. For this purpose, we study BoN through a
smooth version known as Soft Best-of-N (SBoN) and develop a theoretical
framework to address this gap. We analyze the scaling behaviour of BoN by
providing bounds on the KL divergence between the SBoN policy and the reference
policy, offering insights into how performance varies with the number of
samples. We also study the regret gap, i.e., the gap between the expected true
reward under the optimal policy and the SBoN policy. Our theoretical and
empirical findings show that smoothing helps SBoN mitigate reward
overoptimization, especially when the quality of the proxy reward is low.

Abstract: In this paper, we study an online regularized learning algorithm in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) based on a class of dependent

\(\phi\)- and \(\beta\)-mixing coefficients. Under these assumptions, we derive
probabilistic upper bounds as well as convergence rates for both the
exponential and polynomial decay of the mixing coefficients.

Abstract: Distances between probability distributions are a key component of many
statistical machine learning tasks, from two-sample testing to generative
modeling, among others. We introduce a novel distance between measures that
compares them through a Schatten norm of their kernel covariance operators. We
show that this new distance is an integral probability metric that can be
framed between a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and a Wasserstein distance. In
particular, we show that it avoids some pitfalls of MMD, by being more
discriminative and robust to the choice of hyperparameters. Moreover, it
benefits from some compelling properties of kernel methods, that can avoid the
curse of dimensionality for their sample complexity. We provide an algorithm to
compute the distance in practice by introducing an extension of kernel matrix
for difference of distributions that could be of independent interest. Those
advantages are illustrated by robust approximate Bayesian computation under
contamination as well as particle flow simulations.

Conclusion: PQ为量化学习中的不确定性量化提供了深入见解，并在模拟和真实数据中表现优异。

Abstract: Unlike classification, whose goal is to estimate the class of each data point
in a dataset, prevalence estimation or quantification is a task that aims to
estimate the distribution of classes in a dataset. The two main tasks in
prevalence estimation are to adjust for bias, due to the prevalence in the
training dataset, and to quantify the uncertainty in the estimate. The standard
methods used to quantify uncertainty in prevalence estimates are bootstrapping
and Bayesian quantification methods. It is not clear which approach is ideal in
terms of precision (i.e. the width of confidence intervals) and coverage (i.e.
the confidence intervals being well-calibrated). Here, we propose Precise
Quantifier (PQ), a Bayesian quantifier that is more precise than existing
quantifiers and with well-calibrated coverage. We discuss the theory behind PQ
and present experiments based on simulated and real-world datasets. Through
these experiments, we establish the factors which influence quantification
precision: the discriminatory power of the underlying classifier; the size of
the labeled dataset used to train the quantifier; and the size of the unlabeled
dataset for which prevalence is estimated. Our analysis provides deep insights
into uncertainty quantification for quantification learning.
