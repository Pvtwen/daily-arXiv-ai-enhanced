We present the design of an end-to-end wireless autoencoder architecture that jointly optimizes the transmitter and receiver encoding/decoding in the Walsh domain to mitigate interference from coexisting narrower-band 5G base stations. By exploiting the orthogonality and self-inverse properties of Walsh functions, the system distributes and learns to encode bit-words across parallel Walsh branches. Through analytical modeling and simulation, we characterize how 5G CPOFDM interference maps into the Walsh domain and identify optimal ratios of transmission frequencies and sampling rate where the end-to-end autoencoder achieves the highest rejection. Experimental results show that the proposed autoencoder achieves up to 12 dB of ICI rejection while maintaining a low block error rate (BLER) for the same baseline channel noise, i.e., baseline Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) without the interference."}

This letter proposes, for the first time, a framework that realizes sparsity in multilayer US-RIS using two strategies, namely element-wise sparsity and geometric sparsity. The element-wise approach distributes a limited number of active elements irregularly across multiple layers, thereby exploiting additional spatial degrees of freedom and boosting the achievable rate. For further performance enhancement, a novel foldable RIS architecture leveraging geometric sparsity is proposed, achieving additional gains by optimizing the folding topology of its multilayer structure. Simulation results show that the proposed sparse architectures provide consistently higher achievable rates than existing designs."}

This trend is driving the evolution from static, stand-alone spectrum allocation toward spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum sharing. A critical element of this transition is spectrum sensing, which facilitates informed decision-making in shared environments. Previous studies on spectrum sensing and cognitive radio have been largely limited to individual sensors or small sensor groups. In this work, a large-scale spectrum sensing network (LarS-Net) is designed in a cost-effective manner. Spectrum sensors are either co-located with base stations (BSs) to share the tower, backhaul, and power infrastructure, or integrated directly into BSs as a new feature leveraging active BS antenna systems. As an example incumbent system, fixed service microwave link operating in the lower-7 GHz band is investigated. This band is a primary candidate for 6G, being considered by the WRC-23, ITU, and FCC. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we determine the minimum subset of BSs equipped with sensing capability to guarantee a target incumbent detection probability. The simulations account for various sensor antenna configurations, propagation channel models, and duty cycles for both incumbent transmissions and sensing operations. Building on this framework, we introduce three network-level sensing performance metrics: Emission Detection Probability (EDP), Temporal Detection Probability (TDP), and Temporal Mis-detection Probability (TMP), which jointly capture spatial coverage, temporal detectability, and multi-node diversity effects. Using these metrics, we analyze the impact of LarS-Net inter-site distance, noise uncertainty, and sensing duty-cycle on large-scale sensing performance."}

If a propagation channel affects all transmitted signals equally, the relative phases are a function of the directions of departure and arrival, as well as the transmit and receive hardware. In a non-stationary channel, the amplitudes and phases of arriving signals may vary significantly over time, making it infeasible to directly measure the influence of hardware. In this paper, we present a calibration method for achieving indirect measurement and compensation of hardware influences in non-stationary channels. Our method characterizes the patterns of array elements relative to a reference element and estimates these relative patterns, termed residual surfaces, using a Slepian spherical harmonic basis. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our calibration method achieves beamforming gains that closely match theoretical optimums. Our results also show a reduction in the error in estimating the target direction, lower side lobes, and improve null-steering capabilities."}

More specifically, our method builds on recent advances in active learning for sensitivity analysis (Sobol' indices and derivative-based global sensitivity measures, DGSM) that exploit derivatives obtained from a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate. By leveraging the joint posterior distribution of the GP gradient, we develop acquisition functions that better account for correlations between partial derivatives and their impact on the response surface, leading to a more comprehensive and robust methodology than existing DGSM-oriented criteria.

We construct a multi-band channel occupancy dataset through analyzing 61 days of empirical data and formulate a next-minute channel occupancy prediction task across all frequency channels.

Numerical results show that learning-based methods outperform the statistical baseline on dynamic channels, particularly under fixed false-alarm constraints. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-driven spectrum occupancy prediction, indicating that lightweight learning models can effectively support future deployment-oriented DSS systems."}

Recent score-matching approaches to SIVI (SIVI-SM) address this issue via a minimax formulation, at the expense of an additional lower-level optimization problem. In this paper, we propose kernel semi-implicit variational inference (KSIVI), a principled and tractable alternative that eliminates the lower-level optimization by leveraging kernel methods. We show that when optimizing over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the lower-level problem admits an explicit solution, reducing the objective to the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD). Exploiting the hierarchical structure of semi-implicit distributions, the resulting KSD objective can be efficiently optimized using stochastic gradient methods. We establish optimization guarantees via variance bounds on Monte Carlo gradient estimators and derive statistical generalization bounds of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{n})$.

Characterization of integrated mmWave transmitters remains challenging due to limited angular coverage and alignment variability in conventional probe-station techniques, as well as the impracticality of anechoic-chamber testing for platform-mounted active modules. To address these challenges, we introduce RAPTAR, an autonomous measurement system for angular received-power acquisition under realistic installation constraints. A collaborative robot executes geometry-calibrated, collision-aware hemispherical trajectories while carrying a calibrated receive probe, enabling controlled and repeatable spatial positioning around a fixed device under test. A spectrum-analyzer-based receiver chain acquires amplitude-only received power as a function of angle and distance following quasi-static pose stabilization. The proposed framework enables repeatable angular received-power mapping and power-domain comparison against idealized free-space references derived from full-wave simulation. Experimental results for a 60-GHz radar module demonstrate a mean absolute received-power error below 2 dB relative to simulation-derived references and a 36.5 % reduction in error compared to manual probe-station measurements, attributed primarily to reduced alignment variability and consistent spatial sampling. The proposed method eliminates the need for coherent field measurements and near-field transformations, enabling practical power-domain characterization of embedded mmWave modules. It is well suited for angular validation in real-world platforms where conventional anechoic measurements are impractical."}

We analyze the tracking performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its momentum variants (Polyak heavy-ball and Nesterov) under uniform strong convexity and smoothness in varying stepsize regimes. We derive finite-time bounds in expectation and with high probability for the tracking error, establishing a sharp decomposition into three components: a transient initialization term, a noise-induced variance term, and a drift-induced tracking lag. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a fundamental trade-off: while momentum can suppress gradient noise, it incurs an explicit penalty on the tracking capability. We show that momentum can substantially amplify drift-induced tracking error, with amplification that becomes unbounded as the momentum parameter approaches one, formalizing the intuition that using 'stale' gradients hinders adaptation to rapid regime shifts. Complementing these upper bounds, we establish minimax lower bounds for dynamic regret under gradient-variation constraints. These lower bounds prove that the inertia-induced penalty is not an artifact of analysis but an information-theoretic barrier: in drift-dominated regimes, momentum creates an unavoidable 'inertia window' that fundamentally degrades performance. Collectively, these results provide a definitive theoretical grounding for the empirical instability of momentum in dynamic environments and delineate the precise regime boundaries where SGD provably outperforms its accelerated counterparts."}

Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been used in recent research to perform DBS in a more adaptive manner to improve overall patient outcome. These RL algorithms are, however, too complex to be trained in vivo due to their long convergence time and requirement of high computational resources.\n  We propose a new Time & Threshold-Triggered Multi-Armed Bandit (T3P MAB) RL approach for DBS that is more effective than existing algorithms. Further, our T3P agent is lightweight enough to be deployed in the implant, unlike current deep-RL strategies, and even forgoes the need for an offline training phase. Additionally, most existing RL approaches have focused on modulating only frequency or amplitude, and the possibility of tuning them together remains greatly unexplored in the literature. Our RL agent can tune both frequency and amplitude of DBS signals to the brain with better sample efficiency and requires minimal time to converge. We implement an MAB agent for DBS for the first time on hardware to report energy measurements and prove its suitability for resource-constrained platforms.

The network weights were learned using a multi-level k-space consistent loss in a self-supervised manner. To further enhance reconstruction quality, phase-contrast specific magnitude and phase priors were incorporated, including the similarity of anatomical structures and smoothness of wave-induced harmonic displacement. Experiments were conducted using both 3D gradient-echo spiral and multi-slice spin-echo spiral MRE datasets. Compared to the conventional linear subspace-based approaches, the nonlinear network representation method was able to produce superior image reconstruction with suppressed noise and artifacts from a single in-plane spiral arm per MRE repetition (e.g., total R=10), yielding comparable stiffness estimation to the fully sampled data.

The proposed approach extends applicability to a broader class of $f$-divergences than previously reported and yields theoretical results that recover previously known results. Additionally, the difference between the expected empirical risk of the ERM-$f$DR solution and that of its reference measure is characterized, providing insights into previously studied cases of $f$-divergences. A central contribution is the introduction of the normalization function, a mathematical object that is critical in both the dual formulation and practical computation of the ERM-$f$DR solution. This work presents an implicit characterization of the normalization function as a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE), establishes its key properties, and subsequently leverages them to construct a numerical algorithm for approximating the normalization factor under mild assumptions. Further analysis demonstrates structural equivalences between ERM-$f$DR problems with different $f$-divergences via transformations of the empirical risk. Finally, the proposed algorithm is used to compute the training and test risks of ERM-$f$DR solutions under different $f$-divergence regularizers.

As a result, most radar-based fall detectors are trained on staged falls from young volunteers, and representation choices are rarely tested against the radar signals from dangerous falls. This paper uses a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar digital twin as a single simulated room testbed to study how representation choice affects fall/non-fall discrimination. From the same simulated range-Doppler sequence, Doppler-time spectrograms, three-channel per-receiver spectrogram stacks, and time-pooled range-Doppler maps (RDMs) are derived and fed to an identical compact CNN under matched training on a balanced fall/non-fall dataset. In this twin, temporal spectrograms reach 98-99% test accuracy with similar precision and recall for both classes, while static RDMs reach 89.4% and show more variable training despite using the same backbone. A qualitative comparison between synthetic and measured fall spectrograms suggests that the twin captures gross Doppler-time structure, but amplitude histograms reveal differences in the distributions of amplitude values consistent with receiver processing not modeled in the twin. Because the twin omits noise and hardware impairments and is only qualitatively compared to a single measured example, these results provide representation-level guidance under controlled synthetic conditions rather than ready-to-use clinical performance in real settings."}

We address the crucial question of how to optimally allocate a fixed annotation budget between ground-truth labels and pairwise preferences in AI. Our solution, grounded in semi-parametric inference, casts the budget allocation problem as a monotone missing data framework. Building on this formulation, we introduce Preference-Calibrated Active Learning (PCAL), a novel method that learns the optimal data acquisition strategy and develops a statistically efficient estimator for functionals of the data distribution. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic optimality of our PCAL estimator and establish a key robustness guarantee that ensures robust performance even with poorly estimated nuisance models. Our flexible framework applies to a general class of problems, by directly optimizing the estimator's variance instead of requiring a closed-form solution. This work provides a principled and statistically efficient approach for budget-constrained learning in modern AI.

Using ubiquitous sensors such as Passive InfraRed sensors (PIR) and door sensors is drawing increasing interest for monitoring daily activities and facilitating preventative healthcare interventions for the elderly. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from passive sensors mostly relies on traditional machine learning and includes data segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. While techniques like Sensor Weighting Mutual Information (SWMI) capture spatial context in a feature vector, effectively leveraging temporal information remains a challenge. We tackle this by clustering activities into morning, afternoon, and night, and encoding them into the feature weighting method calculating distinct mutual information matrices. We further propose to extend the feature vector by incorporating time of day and day of week as cyclical temporal features, as well as adding a feature to track the user's location. The experiments show improved accuracy and F1-score over existing state-of-the-art methods in three out of four real-world datasets, with highest gains in a low-data regime.

To address these issues and further boost robustness, this paper introduces the concept of multi-kernel mixture correntropy (MKMC), along with its key properties. MKMC employs a flexible kernel function composed of a mixture of two Students t-Cauchy functions with adjustable (non-zero) means. Building on this criterion within multi-sensor networks, we propose a robust distributed extended Kalman filter-AMKMMC-RDEKF based on adaptive multi-kernel mixture maximum correntropy. To reduce communication overhead, a consensus averaging strategy is incorporated. Furthermore, an adaptive mechanism is introduced to mitigate the impact of manually tuned free parameters. At the same time, the computational complexity and convergence ability of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through challenging scenarios involving power system and land vehicle state estimation."}

Machine learning (ML) models can improve diabetes management by predicting hypoglycemia and providing optimal prevention methods. ML models are classified into regression and classification based, that forecast glucose levels and identify events based on defined labels, respectively. This review investigates state-of-the-art models trained on data of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices from patients with T1D.

The EWABG model works by integrating individual path-loss models into one single model in the least-squares sense, allowing to extend knowledge from frequencies and distances covered by path-loss datasets or path-loss propagation models. The proposed EWABG model is the first non-linear extension of the common ABG-based approach, which surpasses the non-uniformity problem between the low and high 5G frequencies (as most measurements campaigns have taken place in low frequencies). The EWABG also addresses the problem of removing outlier measurements, a step not included in previous propagation path-loss models. In this case, we have compared the most recent techniques for avoiding outliers, and we have adopted the Theil-Sen method, due to its strong robustness demonstrated in the experiments carried out. In addition, the proposed model specifically considers non-linear attenuation by atmospheric gases, in order to improve its estimations. The good performance of the proposed EWABG model has been tested and compared against recent 5G propagation path-loss models including the ABG and WABG models. The exhaustive experimentation carried out includes the 5G non-line-of-sight environment in different 5G scenarios, UMiSC, UMiOS and UMa.

In this work, we study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as a form of soft partitioning of the representation space into overlapping local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry probe. It analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular-value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting that permits exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully-soft routing architectures under matched capacity. Across random seeds, we observe that MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity, with expert-local Jacobians exhibiting smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. At the same time, weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across a larger number of principal directions, indicating higher effective rank under identical input distributions. We further find that average expert Jacobians are nearly orthogonal, suggesting a decomposition of the transformation into low-overlap expert-specific subspaces rather than scaled variants of a shared map. We analyze how routing sharpness modulates these effects, showing that Top-k routing produces lower-rank, more concentrated expert-local structure, while fully-soft routing yields broader, higher-rank representations. Together, these results support a geometric interpretation of MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance."}

However, each of these methods has significant drawbacks, including monetary and/or computational expense, limited quantity, inaccurate statistics, and overall complexity. In contrast, the boiling flow algorithm is a simple, computationally efficient model that can generate atmospheric phase screen data with only a handful of parameters. However, boiling flow has not been widely used in aero-optic applications, at least in part because some of these parameters, such as r0, are not clearly defined for aero-optic data. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to use the boiling flow algorithm to generate arbitrary length synthetic data to match the statistics of measured aero-optic data.

Probe families induce an operational equivalence relation on kernels and therefore a gauge; anchors select representatives relative to that probe.

Using the weighted RSS measurements and generalized trust region subproblem (GTRS), we propose the GTRS-based localization technique with Unknown Transmit Power (GUTP), which can be solved by a simple bisection method. Unlike conventional localization methods that require prior knowledge of the target node's transmit power, GUTP jointly estimates both the location and transmit power of the target node, broadening its practical use. Additionally, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for RSS-based underwater localization with known and unknown transmit power, respectively. Extensive simulations demonstrate that GUTP achieves enhanced accuracy and significantly lower computational complexity in estimating the target node's location and transmit power compared to existing semidefinite programming (SDP)-based techniques."}

Probabilistic forecasts are needed to plan the inventory levels; the predictive distribution should cover non-negative values, have a mass in zero and a long upper tail. Intermittent time series are commonly forecast using local models, which are trained individually on each time series. In the last years global models, which are trained on a large collection of time series, have become popular for time series forecasting. Global models are often based on neural networks. However, they have not yet been exhaustively tested on intermittent time series. We carry out the first study comparing state-of-the-art local (iETS, TweedieGP) and global models (D-Linear, DeepAR, Transformers) on intermittent time series. For neural networks models we consider three different distribution heads suitable for intermittent time series: negative binomial, hurdle-shifted negative binomial and Tweedie. We use, for the first time, the last two distribution heads with neural networks. We perform experiments on five large datasets comprising more than 40'000 real-world time series. Among neural networks D-Linear provides best accuracy; it also consistently outperforms the local models. Moreover, it has also low computational requirements. Transformers-based architectures are instead much more computationally demanding and less accurate. Among the distribution heads, the Tweedie provides the best estimates of the highest quantiles, while the negative binomial offers overall the best performance."}

This increased training/inference cost paved the way for efficient model size reduction/parametric reduction deploying Sparse Attention techniques. In this paper, we start analyzing one of the techniques of Sparse Attention called Symmetric Dot-Product Attention (referred to as Symmetric Attention) and propose a novel unified model architecture called Noise Diffused Symmetric Attention Transformer to enhance the model's performance. While maintaining the memory gains of Symmetric Attention, with minute overhead in terms of model parameters and computational overhead, the proposed model brings in enhanced performance in terms of accuracy and inference-time sampling. The proposed model is validated upon GPT2 base model and the results reflect the performance gains falling between plain Symmetric attention and GPT2 base model on a variety of GLUE benchmark tasks in terms of accuracy, with significant model size reduction with respect to the base model."}

However, conventional downtilted base stations primarily provide sectorized forward lobes for ground services, failing to sense air targets due to backward blind zones. In this paper, a novel antenna structure is proposed to enable air-ground beam steering, facilitating simultaneous full-space sensing and communication (S&C). Specifically, instead of inserting a reflector behind the antenna array for backlobe mitigation, an omni-steering plate is introduced to collaborate with the active array for omnidirectional beamforming. Building on this hardware innovation, sum S&C mutual information (MI) is maximized, jointly optimizing user scheduling, passive coefficients of the omni-steering plate, and beamforming of the active array. The problem is decomposed into two subproblems: one for optimizing passive coefficients via Riemannian gradient on the manifold, and the other for optimizing user scheduling and active array beamforming. Exploiting relationships among S&C MI, data decoding MMSE, and parameter estimation MMSE, the original subproblem is equivalently transformed into a sum weighted MMSE problem, rigorously established via the Lagrangian and first-order optimality conditions. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baselines in sum-MI and MSE, while providing 360 sensing coverage. Beampattern analysis further demonstrates effective user scheduling and accurate target alignment."}

Unlike conventional SR, the BRx performs energy detection and never decodes the primary signal, thereby removing ambiguity and preventing exposure of the primary payload to unintended receivers. In this paper, we formulate the problem as the minimization of the transmit power subject to a common broadcast rate constraint across all PRs and a bit error rate (BER) constraint at the BRx. The problem is nonconvex due to the unit-modulus RIS constraint and coupled quadratic forms. Leveraging a rate-balanced reformulation and a monotonic BER ratio characterization, we develop a low-complexity penalty-based block coordinate descent algorithm with closed-form updates. Numerical results show fast convergence of the proposed algorithm and reduced power consumption of the considered RIS-enhanced information-decoupled SR system over conventional SR baselines."}

For fair supervised learning, particularly in pre-processing, there have been two main categories: data fairness and task-tailored fairness. The former directly finds an intermediate distribution among the groups, independent of the type of the downstream model, so a learned downstream classification/regression model returns similar predictive scores to individuals inputting the same covariates irrespective of their sensitive attributes. The latter explicitly takes the supervised learning task into account when constructing the pre-processing map. In this work, we study algorithmic fairness for supervised learning and argue that the data fairness approaches impose overly strong regularization from the perspective of the HGR correlation. This motivates us to devise a novel pre-processing approach tailored to supervised learning. We account for the trade-off between fairness and utility in obtaining the pre-processing map. Then we study the behavior of arbitrary downstream supervised models learned on the transformed data to find sufficient conditions to guarantee their fairness improvement and utility preservation. To our knowledge, no prior work in the branch of task-tailored methods has theoretically investigated downstream guarantees when using pre-processed data. We further evaluate our framework through comparison studies based on tabular and image data sets, showing the superiority of our framework which preserves consistent trade-offs among multiple downstream models compared to recent competing models. Particularly for computer vision data, we see our method alters only necessary semantic features related to the central machine learning task to achieve fairness."}

This paper demonstrates that preserving temporal information significantly improves model performance in such scenarios. We compare a multilayer perceptron, a windowed multilayer perceptron, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) on three-phase air-water-oil flow data from 342 experiments. Whereas prior work typically compresses each experiment into a single averaged sample, we instead compute short-time averages from within each experiment and train models that preserve temporal information at several downsampling intervals. The CNN performed best at 0.25 Hz with approximately 95 % of relative errors below 13 %, a normalized root mean squared error of 0.03, and a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 4.3 %, clearly outperforming the best single-averaged model and demonstrating that short-time averaging within individual experiments is preferable.

Across Burgers' equation, Navier-Stokes, and reactive flows, D-PARC achieves superior fidelity compared to substantially larger architectures. Analysis reveals that kernels display anti-clustering behavior, evolving into a learned \"active filtration\" strategy distinct from traditional h- or p-adaptivity. Effective receptive field analysis confirms that D-PARC autonomously concentrates resources in high-strain regions while coarsening focus elsewhere, mirroring adaptive refinement in computational mechanics. This demonstrates that physically intuitive architectural design can outperform parameter scaling, establishing that strategic learning in lean networks offers a more effective path forward for PADL than indiscriminate network expansion."}

Although additive noise can be correlated in practical scenarios, e.g., due to jamming, clutter, or other external disturbances, the effect of such correlation on the MMSE channel estimator in this setting remains unexplored in prior work. Against this backdrop, we derive a novel analytical expression for the general MIMO MMSE channel estimator, which is inherently nonlinear in one-bit observations, and accommodates arbitrary channel and noise correlation structures. To further characterize the impact of noise correlation, we subsequently specialize the general MMSE expression to certain tractable multi antenna configurations in which both the channel and the noise assume single-parameter constant correlation structures. Our analyses reveal nontrivial, noise-correlation-induced scenarios in which the estimator remains linear despite non-zero channel and noise correlation parameters. Moreover, the results indicate that, at low-to-medium signal-to-noise ratio, noise correlation improves the MMSE performance when channels are uncorrelated, but degrades performance when channels are strongly correlated."}

This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns. When each row contains only $C$ entries -- fewer than the rank of $M$ -- accurate imputation of $M$ is impossible. Instead, we estimate the row span of $M$ or the averaged second-moment matrix $T = M^{\\top} M / n$.\n  The empirical second-moment matrix computed from observed entries exhibits non-random and sparse missingness. We propose an unbiased estimator that normalizes each nonzero entry of the second moment by its observed frequency, followed by gradient descent to impute the missing entries of $T$. The normalization divides a weighted sum of $n$ binomial random variables by the total number of ones. We show that the estimator is unbiased for any $p$ and enjoys low variance.

Characterization of integrated mmWave transmitters remains challenging due to limited angular coverage and alignment variability in conventional probe-station techniques, as well as the impracticality of anechoic-chamber testing for platform-mounted active modules. To address these challenges, we introduce RAPTAR, an autonomous measurement system for angular received-power acquisition under realistic installation constraints. A collaborative robot executes geometry-calibrated, collision-aware hemispherical trajectories while carrying a calibrated receive probe, enabling controlled and repeatable spatial positioning around a fixed device under test. A spectrum-analyzer-based receiver chain acquires amplitude-only received power as a function of angle and distance following quasi-static pose stabilization. The proposed framework enables repeatable angular received-power mapping and power-domain comparison against idealized free-space references derived from full-wave simulation. Experimental results for a 60-GHz radar module demonstrate a mean absolute received-power error below 2 dB relative to simulation-derived references and a 36.5 % reduction in error compared to manual probe-station measurements, attributed primarily to reduced alignment variability and consistent spatial sampling. The proposed method eliminates the need for coherent field measurements and near-field transformations, enabling practical power-domain characterization of embedded mmWave modules. It is well suited for angular validation in real-world platforms where conventional anechoic measurements are impractical."}

Two dominant paradigms have emerged: activation-aware methods such as AWQ prioritize channels with large activation magnitudes, while second-order methods such as GPTQ allocate quantization error according to input covariance structure. Despite strong empirical performance, these approaches remain conceptually fragmented, and it is unclear what underlying quantity they are approximating. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for PTQ by formalizing activation sensitivity, defined as the expected impact of channel-wise perturbations on the loss. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we show that sensitivity naturally arises as the squared norm of gradient-weighted activations, yielding a principled measure of channel importance that captures both activation magnitude and downstream error propagation. Within this framework, AWQ and GPTQ can be interpreted as complementary approximations that recover sensitivity under distinct simplifying assumptions. We analyze the design space of sensitivity metrics, connect gradient-based saliency, Fisher information, and Hessian-based criteria, and clarify their relationships to classical pruning methods such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon.

Five commercial FMCW radar modules operating in the 58--63 GHz band are arranged in a semi-circular configuration around the lens, whose tailored refractive-index profile accommodates bistatic radar modules with co-located transmit (TX) and receive (RX) antennas. The resulting architecture generates multiple fixed high-gain beams with improved angular resolution and minimal mutual interference. Each radar operates independently but is temporally synchronized through a centralized Python-based acquisition framework to enable parallel data collection and low-latency motion tracking. A 10-cm-diameter 3D-printed prototype demonstrates a measured gain enhancement of approximately 12 dB for each module, corresponding to a substantial improvement in detection range. Full-wave simulations and measurements confirm effective non-contact, privacy-preserving short-range human-motion detection across five 28-degree sectors, providing 140-degree total angular coverage.

When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\\max_i |A_i|)\\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size.

Linear attention mechanisms offer linear or near-linear scaling yet often incur performance degradation. Hybrid models that integrate full and linear attention layers promise a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but face two major challenges: training such hybrid models from scratch is computationally expensive, and manually designing the optimal placement of attention types is highly nontrivial. We address both issues by first transferring weights from the pretrained full-attention modules to its linear attention counterparts through blockwise local distillation, and second, introducing a greedy layer replacement strategy that iteratively substitutes full attention blocks with linear ones while monitoring validation performance on the target task. This yields a task-specific hybrid model in a single efficient pass, without costly re-training or neural architecture search, and can be applied to any pretrained full-attention backbone for diverse downstream tasks."}

This requires $|λ- \\AM| < \\AM$ and diverges when $κ> 4$. We work instead with the moment-generating function $M(t) = \\E[X^t]$ for normalized eigenvalues $X = λ/\\AM$. Since $M'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$, the log-determinant becomes $\\log\\det(A) = n(\\log \\AM + M'(0))$ -- the problem reduces to estimating a derivative at $t = 0$. Trace powers give $M(k)$ at positive integers, but interpolating $M(t)$ directly is ill-conditioned due to exponential growth. The transform $K(t) = \\log M(t)$ compresses this range. Normalization by $\\AM$ ensures $K(0) = K(1) = 0$. With these anchors fixed, we interpolate $K$ through $m+1$ consecutive integers and differentiate to estimate $K'(0)$. However, this local interpolation cannot capture arbitrary spectral features.\n  We prove a fundamental limit: no continuous estimator using finitely many positive moments can be uniformly accurate over unbounded conditioning. Positive moments downweight the spectral tail; $K'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$ is tail-sensitive. This motivates guaranteed bounds. From the same traces we derive upper bounds on $(\\det A)^{1/n}$.

In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high- from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.

Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality.

By explicitly modeling the coupling between sensing-induced localization errors and channel-estimation errors, we capture the tradeoff between sensing accuracy and communication throughput. Based on this model, we jointly optimize the time-allocation ratio, sensing covariance matrix, and robust downlink beamforming under imperfect channel state information (CSI). The resulting non-convex problem is addressed via a semidefinite programming (SDP)-based reformulation within an alternating-optimization framework. To further reduce computational complexity, we also propose two low-complexity suboptimal designs: an error-ignorant scheme and a maximum ratio transmission (MRT)-based scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves localization accuracy over far-field and monostatic setups, thereby reducing channel estimation errors and ultimately enhancing the achievable rate. Moreover, the error-ignorant scheme performs well under stringent sensing requirements, whereas the MRT-based scheme remains robust over a wide range of sensing requirements by adapting the time-allocation ratio, albeit with some beamforming loss."}

This phenomenon describes the behavior of gradient alignment in SGD updates. Specifically, during the initial phase of SGD updates, the alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace tends to decrease. Subsequently, it enters a rising phase and eventually stabilizes in a high-alignment phase. The alignment is considered ``suspicious'' because, paradoxically, the projected gradient update along this highly-aligned dominant subspace proves ineffective at reducing the loss. The focus of this work is to give a fine-grained analysis in a high-dimensional quadratic setup about how step size selection produces this phenomenon. Our main contribution can be summarized as follows: We propose a step-size condition revealing that in low-alignment regimes, an adaptive critical step size $η_t^*$ separates alignment-decreasing ($η_t < η_t^*$) from alignment-increasing ($η_t > η_t^*$) regimes, whereas in high-alignment regimes, the alignment is self-correcting and decreases regardless of the step size. We further show that under sufficient ill-conditioning, a step size interval exists where projecting the SGD updates to the bulk space decreases the loss while projecting them to the dominant space increases the loss, which explains a recent empirical observation that projecting gradient updates to the dominant subspace is ineffective. Finally, based on this adaptive step-size theory, we prove that for a constant step size and large initialization, SGD exhibits this distinct two-phase behavior: an initial alignment-decreasing phase, followed by stabilization at high alignment."}

We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam.

Pixel antennas represent a general class of reconfigurable antenna designs in which the radiating surface, regardless of its shape or size, is divided into sub-wavelength elements called pixels. Each pixel is connected to its neighboring elements through radio frequency switches. By controlling pixel connections, the pixel antenna topology can be flexibly adjusted so that the resulting radiation pattern can be reconfigured. However, conventional pixel antennas have only a single, fixed-position feeding port, which is not efficient for angular sensing. Therefore, in this work, we further extend the reconfigurability of pixel antennas by introducing the HRPA, which enables both geometry control of the pixel antenna and switching of its feeding ports. The model of the proposed HRPA, including both circuit and radiation parameters, is derived. A codebook is then defined, consisting of pixel connection states and feeding port positions for each sensing area.

Although they exhibit strong average zero-shot performance on forecasting tasks, their predictions on certain critical regions of the data are not always reliable, limiting their usability in real-world applications, especially when data exhibits unique trends. In this paper, we propose a selective forecasting framework to identify these critical segments of time series using shapelets. We learn shapelets using shift-invariant dictionary learning on the validation split of the target domain dataset. Utilizing distance-based similarity to these shapelets, we facilitate the user to selectively discard unreliable predictions and be informed of the model's realistic capabilities. Empirical results on diverse benchmark time series datasets demonstrate that our approach leveraging both zero-shot and full-shot fine-tuned models reduces the overall error by an average of 22.17% for zero-shot and 22.62% for full-shot fine-tuned model. Furthermore, our approach using zero-shot and full-shot fine-tuned models, also outperforms its random selection counterparts by up to 21.41% and 21.43% on one of the datasets."}

Each relay node follows the OP-minimized principle to choose the forwarding schemes. To reduce self-interference and avoid multi-user interference, half-duplex relays and frequency division multiple access schemes are considered, respectively. On this basis, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem to mitigate the rate loss introduced by the half-duplex mode. To solve this problem, we first transform the original nonconvex problem into a power control optimization problem by obtaining the closed form of bandwidth allocation and substituting it into the original problem. Then, we solve the power control optimization problem with a low complexity method. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm to improve the sum rate of the system."}

In this work, we show that the activation pattern of a SOM - the squared distances to its prototypes - can be inverted to recover the exact input under mild geometric conditions. This follows from a classical fact in Euclidean distance geometry: a point in $D$ dimensions is uniquely determined by its distances to $D{+}1$ affinely independent references. We derive the corresponding linear system and characterize the conditions under which the inversion is well-posed. Building upon this mechanism, we introduce the Manifold-Aware Unified SOM Inversion and Control (MUSIC) update rule, which enables controlled, semantically meaningful trajectories in latent space. MUSIC modifies squared distances to selected prototypes while preserving others, resulting in a deterministic geometric flow aligned with the SOM's piecewise-linear structure. Tikhonov regularization stabilizes the update rule and ensures smooth motion on high-dimensional datasets. Unlike variational or probabilistic generative models, MUSIC does not rely on sampling, latent priors, or encoder-decoder architectures. If no perturbation is applied, inversion recovers the exact input; when a target cluster or prototype is specified, MUSIC produces coherent semantic variations while remaining on the data manifold. This leads to a new perspective on data augmentation and controllable latent exploration based solely on prototype geometry. We validate the approach using synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the MNIST and the Faces in the Wild dataset. Across all settings, MUSIC produces smooth, interpretable trajectories that reveal the underlying geometry of the learned manifold, illustrating the advantages of SOM-based inversion over unsupervised clustering."}

However, traditional global norm clipping erroneously presupposes gradient homogeneity across different functional modules, leading to an adverse \"spill-over\" effect where volatile parameters force unnecessary scaling on stable ones. To overcome this, we propose Adaptive Group-wise Gradient Clipping (AGGC). AGGC partitions parameters into groups based on functional types and regulates each according to its historical behavior using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Specifically, it constructs an adaptive interval to simultaneously mitigate gradient explosion and vanishing, while employing a time-dependent scheduling mechanism to balance exploration and convergence. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B models show that AGGC consistently outperforms LoRA and frequently surpasses Full Fine-Tuning. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with AGGC achieves an accuracy of 72.93%, exceeding LoRA's 69.5%. AGGC also effectively stabilizes Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), enhancing the logic deduction of Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.2 models. Experimental results demonstrate that AGGC effectively addresses the limitations of traditional gradient clipping methods, particularly in overcoming gradient heterogeneity, by utilizing a modular, adaptive clipping strategy to stabilize the training process. Due to its lightweight design, AGGC can be seamlessly integrated into existing post-training pipelines with negligible overhead."}

To address this limitation, we propose a novel regularization strategy based on local Dirichlet energies defined on small hypercubes centered at the training points. Leveraging pretrained TPBS models, we also introduce two estimators for inference from incomplete samples. Comparative experiments with neural networks demonstrate that TPBS models outperform neural networks in the overfitting regime for most datasets, and maintain competitive performance otherwise. Overall, TPBS models exhibit greater robustness to overfitting and consistently benefit from regularization, while neural networks are more sensitive to overfitting and less effective in leveraging regularization."}

However, their performance in synthesizing treasury futures data is still underexplored. This work emphasizes the characteristics of treasury futures data, including its low volume, market dependencies, and the grouped correlations among multivariables. To overcome these challenges, we propose TF-CoDiT, the first DiT framework for language-controlled treasury futures synthesis. To facilitate low-data learning, TF-CoDiT adapts the standard DiT by transforming multi-channel 1-D time series into Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficient matrices. A U-shape VAE is proposed to encode cross-channel dependencies hierarchically into a latent variable and bridge the latent and DWT spaces through decoding, thereby enabling latent diffusion generation. To derive prompts that cover essential conditions, we introduce the Financial Market Attribute Protocol (FinMAP) - a multi-level description system that standardizes daily$/$periodical market dynamics by recognizing 17$/$23 economic indicators from 7/8 perspectives. In our experiments, we gather four types of treasury futures data covering the period from 2015 to 2025, and define data synthesis tasks with durations ranging from one week to four months. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TF-CoDiT can produce highly authentic data with errors at most 0.433 (MSE) and 0.453 (MAE) to the ground-truth. Further studies evidence the robustness of TF-CoDiT across contracts and temporal horizons."}

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL."}

Although general CL constraints significantly increase the hardness of approximation, previous work has shown that disjoint CL sets permit constant-factor approximations. However, whether local search can achieve such a guarantee in this setting remains an open question. To this end, we propose a novel local search framework based on a transformation to a dominating matching set problem, achieving the best possible approximation ratio of 2.

We first derive fundamental lower bounds on leakage that hold without sacrificing accuracy, thereby identifying the minimum unavoidable information revealed by the computation and the transcript. We then propose simple yet effective privacy-preserving distributed algorithms, and show that with appropriate randomized initialization and parameter choices, our proposed approaches can attach the derived optimal bounds for the considered operators. Extensive experiments validate the tightness of the bounds and demonstrate that network topology and key algorithmic parameters (including the stepsize) govern the observed leakage in line with the theoretical analysis, yielding actionable guidelines for privacy-preserving nonlinear aggregation."}

This family unifies several widely studied objectives within a single framework, including divergence-based marginal matching, weighted average coverage, and worst-case (minimax) coverage. While the concavity of $U_ρ$ captures the diminishing return associated with over-exploration, the simple closed form of the gradient of $U_ρ$ enables an explicit control to prioritize under-explored state--action pairs.

In specific, in this paper, we introduce a practical pipeline for converting complex IQ streams into visually interpretable inputs, hence, enabling general-purpose VLMs to classify modulation schemes without changing their underlying design. Building on this, we construct an RF visual question answering (VQA) benchmark framework that covers 57 classes across major families of analog/digital modulations with three complementary image modes, namely, (i) short \\emph{time-series} IQ segments represented as real/imaginary traces, (ii) magnitude-only \\emph{spectrograms}, and (iii) \\emph{joint} representations that pair spectrograms with a synchronized time-series waveforms.

For fair supervised learning, particularly in pre-processing, there have been two main categories: data fairness and task-tailored fairness. The former directly finds an intermediate distribution among the groups, independent of the type of the downstream model, so a learned downstream classification/regression model returns similar predictive scores to individuals inputting the same covariates irrespective of their sensitive attributes. The latter explicitly takes the supervised learning task into account when constructing the pre-processing map. In this work, we study algorithmic fairness for supervised learning and argue that the data fairness approaches impose overly strong regularization from the perspective of the HGR correlation. This motivates us to devise a novel pre-processing approach tailored to supervised learning. We account for the trade-off between fairness and utility in obtaining the pre-processing map. Then we study the behavior of arbitrary downstream supervised models learned on the transformed data to find sufficient conditions to guarantee their fairness improvement and utility preservation. To our knowledge, no prior work in the branch of task-tailored methods has theoretically investigated downstream guarantees when using pre-processed data. We further evaluate our framework through comparison studies based on tabular and image data sets, showing the superiority of our framework which preserves consistent trade-offs among multiple downstream models compared to recent competing models. Particularly for computer vision data, we see our method alters only necessary semantic features related to the central machine learning task to achieve fairness."}

Performance is measured by team regret under a coordinate-wise nondecreasing, $L$-Lipschitz scalarization $φ$, covering linear, Chebyshev, and smooth monotone utilities. Our main contribution is a communication-corruption coupling: we show that a fixed environment-side budget $Γ$ can translate into an effective corruption level ranging from $Γ$ to $NΓ$, depending on whether agents share raw samples, sufficient statistics, or only arm recommendations. We formalize this via a protocol-induced multiplicity functional and prove regret bounds parameterized by the resulting effective corruption. As corollaries, raw-sample sharing can suffer an $N$-fold larger additive corruption penalty, whereas summary sharing and recommendation-only sharing preserve an unamplified $O(Γ)$ term and achieve centralized-rate team regret. We further establish information-theoretic limits, including an unavoidable additive $Ω(Γ)$ penalty and a high-corruption regime $Γ=Θ(NT)$ where sublinear regret is impossible without clean information. Finally, we characterize how a global budget $ν$ of verified observations restores learnability. That is, verification is necessary in the high-corruption regime, and sufficient once it crosses the identification threshold, with certified sharing enabling the team's regret to become independent of $Γ$."}

We propose a hybrid quantum-classical regression framework designed to mitigate these bottlenecks. Our model prepends a lightweight classical embedding that acts as a learnable geometric preconditioner, reshaping the input representation to better condition a downstream variational quantum circuit. Building on this architecture, we introduce a curriculum optimization protocol that progressively increases circuit depth and transitions from SPSA-based stochastic exploration to Adam-based gradient fine-tuning. We evaluate the approach on PDE-informed regression benchmarks and standard regression datasets under a fixed training budget in a simulator setting. Empirically, the proposed framework consistently improves over pure QNN baselines and yields more stable convergence in data-limited regimes. We further observe reduced structured errors that are visually correlated with oscillatory components on several scientific benchmarks, suggesting that geometric preconditioning combined with curriculum training is a practical approach for stabilizing quantum regression."}

However, existing CRL algorithms often encounter significant constraint violations during training, limiting their applicability in safety-critical scenarios. In this paper, we identify the underestimation of the cost value function as a key factor contributing to these violations. To address this issue, we propose the Memory-driven Intrinsic Cost Estimation (MICE) method, which introduces intrinsic costs to mitigate underestimation and control bias to promote safer exploration. Inspired by flashbulb memory, where humans vividly recall dangerous experiences to avoid risks, MICE constructs a memory module that stores previously explored unsafe states to identify high-cost regions. The intrinsic cost is formulated as the pseudo-count of the current state visiting these risk regions. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic-intrinsic cost value function that incorporates intrinsic costs and adopts a bias correction strategy. Using this function, we formulate an optimization objective within the trust region, along with corresponding optimization methods. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for the proposed cost value function and establish the worst-case constraint violation for the MICE update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MICE significantly reduces constraint violations while preserving policy performance comparable to baselines."}

To tackle these problematic issues, this work provides a survey of recent advances in Semantic Communication (SC) for IoUT, a novel communication paradigm that seeks to harness not raw symbol information but rather its meaning and/or contextual significance. In this paper, we investigate the emerging advanced AI-powered frameworks, including large language models (LLMs), diffusion-based generative encoders, and federated learning (FL), that bridge semantic compression with context-aware prioritization and robust information reconstruction over noisy underwater channels.

Traditional approaches typically pre-train models using dynamic link prediction and directly apply the resulting node temporal embeddings to specific downstream tasks.

Prompt tuning has emerged as an effective solution to this problem. Existing prompting methods are often strongly coupled with specific model architectures or pretraining tasks, which makes it difficult to adapt to recent or future model designs. Moreover, their exclusive focus on modifying node or temporal features while neglecting spatial structural information leads to limited expressiveness and degraded performance. To address these limitations, we propose DDGPrompt, a data-centric prompting framework designed to effectively refine pre-trained node embeddings at the input data level, enabling better adaptability to diverse downstream tasks. We first define a unified node expression feature matrix that aggregates all relevant temporal and structural information of each node, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of dynamic graph models. Then, we introduce three prompt matrices (temporal bias, edge weight, and feature mask) to adjust the feature matrix completely, achieving task-specific adaptation of node embeddings. We evaluate DDGPrompt under a strict few-shot setting on four public dynamic graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional methods and prompting approaches in scenarios with limited labels and cold-start conditions."}

Traditional forecasting methods require significant expert knowledge and struggle to generalize across diverse deployment scenarios. Recent advancements in pre-trained time series models offer new opportunities, but their zero-shot performance on domain-specific tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MoE Encoder module that augments pretrained forecasting models by injecting a sparse mixture-of-experts layer between tokenization and encoding. This design enables two key capabilities: (1) trans forming multivariate forecasting into an expert-guided univariate task, allowing the model to effectively capture inter-variable relations, and (2) supporting localized training and lightweight parameter sharing in federated settings where raw data cannot be exchanged. Extensive experiments on public multivariate datasets demonstrate that MoE-Encoder significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to strong baselines. We further simulate federated environments and show that transferring only MoE-Encoder parameters allows efficient adaptation to new regions, with minimal performance degradation. Our findings suggest that MoE-Encoder provides a scalable and privacy-aware extension to foundation time series models."}

Unlike existing works that mostly assume perfect channel state information (CSI) or location information of Eves, we consider a more practical and challenging scenario, where the locations of Bobs are perfectly known, while only imperfect location information of Eves is available at the BS. We first formulate a robust optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of Bobs while guaranteeing a worst-case limit on the eavesdropping rate under location uncertainty. By transforming Cartesian position errors into the polar domain, we reveal an important near-field angular-error amplification effect: for the same location error, the closer the Eve, the larger the angle error, severely degrading the performance of conventional robust beamforming methods based on imperfect channel state information. To address this issue, we first establish the conditions for which the first-order Taylor approximation of the near-field channel steering vector under location uncertainty is largely accurate. Then, we propose a two-stage robust beamforming method, which first partitions the uncertainty region into multiple fan-shaped sub-regions, followed by the second stage to formulate and solve a refined linear-matrix-inequality (LMI)-based robust beamforming optimization problem. In addition, the proposed method is further extended to scenarios with multiple Bobs and multiple Eves. Finally, numerical results validate that the proposed method achieves a superior trade-off between rate performance and secrecy robustness, hence significantly outperforming existing benchmarks under Eve location uncertainty."}

To address this issue, we propose the Extreme Value policy Optimization (EVO) algorithm, leveraging Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to model and exploit extreme reward and cost samples, reducing constraint violations. EVO introduces an extreme quantile optimization objective to explicitly capture extreme samples in the cost tail distribution. Additionally, we propose an extreme prioritization mechanism during replay, amplifying the learning signal from rare but high-impact extreme samples. Theoretically, we establish upper bounds on expected constraint violations during policy updates, guaranteeing strict constraint satisfaction at a zero-violation quantile level. Further, we demonstrate that EVO achieves a lower probability of constraint violations than expectation-based methods and exhibits lower variance than quantile regression methods. Extensive experiments show that EVO significantly reduces constraint violations during training while maintaining competitive policy performance compared to baselines."}

This model is specifically designed to abstract the inherent complexities of both the DNN architecture and the input data, while maintaining key information about the structure of imbalance within its spectral components.

In dense IoT scenarios, synchronization may be disrupted either by the movement of nodes away from base stations or by the unavailability of reliable Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, which can be affected by physical obstructions, multipath fading, or environmental interference, such as such as walls, buildings, moving objects, or electromagnetic noise from surrounding devices. In such contexts, distributed synchronization through Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) offers a promising solution, as it enables simultaneous transmission to multiple users with different power levels, supporting efficient synchronization while minimizing the signaling overhead. Moreover, NOMA also plays a vital role for dynamic priority management in dense and heterogeneous IoT environments. In this article, we proposed a Two-Stage NOMA-Enabled Framework \"TSN-IoT\" that integrates the mechanisms of conventional Precision Time Protocol (PTP) based synchronization, distributed synchronization and data transmission.

Answering this question requires rigorous evaluation and effective mitigation, but existing approaches fall short on both fronts: evaluation methods force outputs into predefined cultural categories without a neutral option, while mitigation relies on expensive multi-cultural corpora or agent frameworks that use functional roles (e.g., Planner--Critique) lacking explicit cultural representation. To address these gaps, we introduce CEBiasBench, a Chinese--English bilingual benchmark, and Multi-Agent Vote (MAV), which enables explicit ``no bias'' judgments. Using this framework, we find that Chinese prompting merely shifts bias toward East Asian perspectives rather than eliminating it. To mitigate such persistent bias, we propose Multi-Agent Cultural Debate (MACD), a training-free framework that assigns agents distinct cultural personas and orchestrates deliberation via a \"Seeking Common Ground while Reserving Differences\" strategy. Experiments demonstrate that MACD achieves 57.6% average No Bias Rate evaluated by LLM-as-judge and 86.0% evaluated by MAV (vs. 47.6% and 69.0% baseline using GPT-4o as backbone) on CEBiasBench and generalizes to the Arabic CAMeL benchmark, confirming that explicit cultural representation in agent frameworks is essential for cross-cultural fairness."}

We show that PTL-PINNs achieve accuracy comparable to various Runge-Kutta methods, with computational speeds up to one order of magnitude faster. To benchmark performance, we solve a broad set of problems, including nonlinear oscillators across various damping regimes, the equilibrium-centered Lotka-Volterra system, the KPP-Fisher and the Wave equation.

In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, a fixed-length number embedding vector that preserves algebraic operations, including addition, multiplication, and comparison, within the field of rational numbers. We propose a novel Neural Isomorphic Field, a neural abstraction of algebraic structures such as groups and fields. The elements of this neural field are embedding vectors that maintain algebraic structure during computations. Our experiments demonstrate that addition performs exceptionally well, achieving over 95 percent accuracy on key algebraic tests such as identity, closure, and associativity. In contrast, multiplication exhibits challenges, with accuracy ranging from 53 percent to 73 percent across various algebraic properties. These findings highlight the model's strengths in preserving algebraic properties under addition while identifying avenues for further improvement in handling multiplication."}

We first derive closed-form expressions for the system spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) as functions of the power allocation coefficients and the number of active antennas at the access points (APs). Then, we aim to enhance the EE through jointly optimizing antenna activation and power control. This task leads to a non-convex and mixed-integer design problem with high-dimensional design variables. To address this, we propose a novel DRL-based framework, in which the agent learns to map large-scale fading coefficients to AP activation ratio, antenna coefficient, and power coefficient. These coefficients are then employed to determine the number of active antennas per AP and the power factors assigned to users based on closed-form expressions. By optimizing these parameters instead of directly controlling antenna selection and power allocation, the proposed method transforms the intractable optimization into a low-dimensional learning task. Our extensive simulations demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed scheme. Specifically, in a CFmMIMO system with 40 APs and 20 users, it achieves a 50% EE improvement and 3350 times run time reduction compared to the conventional sequential convex approximation method."}

This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE TSP", "summary": "Diversity is an essential concept associated with communication reliability in multipath channels since it determines the slope of bit error rate performance in the medium to high signal-to-noise ratio regions. However, most of the existing analytical frameworks were developed for specific modulation schemes while the efficient validation of full multipath diversity for general modulation schemes remains an open problem. To fill this research gap, we propose to utilize random constellation rotation to ease the conditions for full-diversity modulation designs. For linearly precoded cyclic-prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, we prove that maximum multipath diversity can be attained as long as the spread matrix does not have zero entries, which is a sufficient but easily satisfied condition. Furthermore, we derive the sufficient and necessary condition for general modulation schemes, whose verification can be divided into validation tasks for each column of the modulation matrix. Based on the proposed conditions, maximum diversity order can be attained with the probability of 1 by enabling a randomly generated rotation pattern for both time and doubly dispersive channels. The theoretical analysis in this paper also demonstrates that the diversity evaluation can be concentrated on the pairwise error probability when the number of error symbols is one, which reduces the complexity of diversity-driven design and performance analysis for novel modulation schemes significantly in both time and doubly dispersive channels. Finally, numerical results for various modulation schemes confirm that the theoretical analysis holds in both time and doubly dispersive channels. Furthermore, when employing practical detectors, the random constellation rotation technique consistently enhance the transmission reliability for both coded and uncoded systems."}

However, MoE models are plagued by two fundamental challenges: 1) a load imbalance problem known as the``rich get richer\" phenomenon, where a few experts are over-utilized, and 2) an expert homogeneity problem, where experts learn redundant representations, negating their purpose. Current solutions typically employ an auxiliary load-balancing loss that, while mitigating imbalance, often exacerbates homogeneity by enforcing uniform routing at the expense of specialization. To resolve this, we introduce the Eigen-Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel architecture that leverages a routing mechanism based on a learned orthonormal eigenbasis. EMoE projects input tokens onto this shared eigenbasis and routes them based on their alignment with the principal components of the feature space.

TDA applies row-wise extreme-value thresholding with a length-dependent gate, retaining only exceedances. Inspired by the differential transformer, TDA also subtracts an inhibitory view to enhance expressivity. Theoretically, we prove that TDA controls the expected number of spurious survivors per row to $O(1)$ and that consensus spurious matches across independent views vanish as context grows.

To address this challenge, we propose a burst aware forecasting solution. This challenge may arise in a wide range of wireless networks; therefore, the proposed solution is broadly applicable to settings characterized by bursty traffic patterns where accurate demand forecasting is essential. Our approach introduces three key enhancements to a transformer architecture: (i) a distance from the last burst embedding to capture burst proximity, (ii) two additional linear layers in the decoder to forecast both upcoming bursts and their relative impact, and (iii) use of an asymmetric cost function during model training to better capture burst dynamics. Empirical evaluations in an Earth-fixed cell under high-traffic demand scenario demonstrate that the proposed model reduces prediction error by up to 94% at a one-step horizon and maintains the ability to accurately capture bursts even near the end of longer prediction horizons following Mean Square Error (MSE) metric."}

This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns. When each row contains only $C$ entries -- fewer than the rank of $M$ -- accurate imputation of $M$ is impossible. Instead, we estimate the row span of $M$ or the averaged second-moment matrix $T = M^{\\top} M / n$.\n  The empirical second-moment matrix computed from observed entries exhibits non-random and sparse missingness. We propose an unbiased estimator that normalizes each nonzero entry of the second moment by its observed frequency, followed by gradient descent to impute the missing entries of $T$. The normalization divides a weighted sum of $n$ binomial random variables by the total number of ones. We show that the estimator is unbiased for any $p$ and enjoys low variance.

Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data.

We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines.

Although regularized estimators reduce the variance error, it remains important to quantify their estimation uncertainty. A possible approach for linear regression is to construct confidence ellipsoids with the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) ellipsoidal outer approximation (EOA) algorithm. The SPS EOA builds non-asymptotic confidence ellipsoids under the assumption that the noises are independent and symmetric about zero. This paper introduces an extension of the SPS EOA algorithm to ridge regression, and derives probably approximately correct (PAC) upper bounds for the resulting region sizes.

To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that integrates wavelet-aware modulation, multi-resolution wavelet decomposition, and resolution-adaptive attention for robust anomaly detection. Our approach first applies a deviation-aware modulation scheme to suppress routine behaviors while amplifying anomalous deviations. Next, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes the log signals into multi-resolution representations, capturing both long-term trends and short-term anomalies. Finally, a learnable attention mechanism dynamically reweights the most discriminative frequency bands for detection. On the CERT r4.2 benchmark, our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in precision, recall, and F1 score across various time granularities and scenarios."}

This motivates an investigation into the reasons behind such behavior beyond algorithmic design. In this study, we find that one such reason lies in the distribution shift across training domains. A large degree of distribution shift can lead to better performance even under ERM. Specifically, we derive several theoretical and empirical findings demonstrating that distribution shift plays a crucial role in model learning and benefits learning invariant prediction. Firstly, the proposed upper bounds indicate that the degree of distribution shift directly affects the prediction ability of the learned models. If it is large, the models' ability can increase, approximating invariant prediction models that make stable predictions under arbitrary known or unseen domains; and vice versa. We also prove that, under certain data conditions, ERM solutions can achieve performance comparable to that of invariant prediction models. Secondly, the empirical validation results demonstrated that the predictions of learned models approximate those of Oracle or Optimal models, provided that the degree of distribution shift in the training data increases."}

The classical methods of GLOF detection and prediction have so far mainly relied on hydrological modeling, threshold-based lake monitoring, and manual satellite image analysis. These approaches suffer from several drawbacks: slow updates, reliance on manual labor, and losses in accuracy when clouds interfere and/or lack on-site data. To tackle these challenges, we present IceWatch: a novel deep learning framework for GLOF prediction that incorporates both spatial and temporal perspectives. The vision component, RiskFlow, of IceWatch deals with Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery using a CNN-based classifier and predicts GLOF events based on the spatial patterns of snow, ice, and meltwater. Its tabular counterpart confirms this prediction by considering physical dynamics. TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection. This system ensures strong predictive performance, rapid data processing for real-time use, and robustness to noise and missing information. IceWatch paves the way for automatic, scalable GLOF warning systems. It also holds potential for integration with diverse sensor inputs and global glacier monitoring activities."}

Three deep learning models were developed and compared: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a hybrid CNN with a Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.

In this work, we show that many of these approaches implicitly conflate two fundamental and independent design choices: (i) the sampling geometry, which determines which samples dominate the gradient signal, and (ii) the optimization geometry, which determines how deviations in value are penalized. We formalize this observation by expressing alignment as the minimization of a generalized distance between policy energy and target energy, parameterized by an alpha-divergence-based sampling weight and a Bregman-divergence-based value metric. We demonstrate that the commonly used KL divergence induces an exponential penalty on unbounded value signals, leading to numerical instability and vanishing gradients in high-confidence regimes. To address this issue, we propose Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), a framework that explicitly decouples sampling geometry from optimization geometry. By combining alpha-weighted importance sampling with a chi-square-induced quadratic regularization in ratio coordinates, OPO yields a simple and well-conditioned objective with linear gradient dynamics. This formulation maintains stable optimization while preserving peak-seeking behavior and avoids gradient saturation even when model confidence is high. Our analysis positions OPO as a unifying perspective on existing alignment methods and provides a principled foundation for robust reasoning-oriented training."}

In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is subsequently applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings by enabling interactions across temporal patches.

A remarkable feature of SDP is that the optimization is convex, which allows the problem to be efficiently solved by a variety of numerical algorithms. We have tested several commercially available SDP solvers, all of which allowed for the reconstruction of quantum channels of different forms. A notable feature is that the Kraus rank of the obtained quantum channel typically comprises less than a few percent of its maximal possible value. This suggests that a relatively small Kraus rank quantum channel is typically sufficient to describe experimentally observed classical data.

When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\\max_i |A_i|)\\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size.

We systematically evaluate these techniques alongside previously proposed methods for improving stability. Our improved architecture successfully trains on systems of unprecedented complexity, including triple pendulums, and achieved 96.6\\% lower validation loss value and 90.68\\% better stability than baseline LNNs in double pendulum systems. With the improved framework, we show that our LNNs can learn Lagrangians representing geodesic motion in both non-relativistic and general relativistic settings.

Here we typically maintain counters in each leaf which allow us to determine the optimal split, and whether the split should be done. In this paper we focus on how to speed up the search for the optimal split when dealing with sparse binary features and a binary class. We focus on finding splits that have the approximately optimal information gain or Gini index. In both cases finding the optimal split can be done in $O(d)$ time, where $d$ is the number of features. We propose an algorithm that yields $(1 + α)$ approximation when using conditional entropy in amortized $O(α^{-1}(1 + m\\log d) \\log \\log n)$ time, where $m$ is the number of 1s in a data point, and $n$ is the number of data points.

We design heuristic policies, train learning agents with expert demonstrations, and improve them using Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). From a theoretical standpoint, we show that gamification reduces model complexity and yields tighter generalization bounds than vector-based formulations. Experiments across multiple EV arrival patterns confirm that gamified learning enhances load balancing.

In this paper, we introduce two advanced machine-learning architectures tailored for predicting biosignature species fluxes from exoplanetary reflected-light spectra: a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) and our novel model architecture, the Spectral Query Adaptive Transformer (SQuAT). The BCNN robustly quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, offering reliable predictions under diverse observational conditions, whereas SQuAT employs query-driven attention mechanisms to enhance interpretability by explicitly associating spectral features with specific biosignature species. We demonstrate that both models achieve comparably high predictive accuracy on an augmented dataset spanning a wide range of exoplanetary conditions, while highlighting their distinct advantages in uncertainty quantification and spectral interpretability. These capabilities position our methods as promising tools for accelerating target triage, optimizing observation schedules, and maximizing scientific return for upcoming flagship missions such as HWO."}

Iterative refinements of these models have introduced an increasing number of architectural mechanisms, leading to increased complexity and computational costs. Nevertheless, systematic direct comparisons among these models remain limited. Existing benchmark tasks are either too simplistic to reveal substantial differences or excessively resource-intensive for experimentation. In this work, we propose a refined taxonomy of linear recurrent models and introduce SelectivBench, a set of lightweight and customizable synthetic benchmark tasks for systematically evaluating sequence models. SelectivBench specifically evaluates selectivity in sequence models at small to medium scale, such as the capacity to focus on relevant inputs while ignoring context-based distractors. It employs rule-based grammars to generate sequences with adjustable complexity, incorporating irregular gaps that intentionally violate transition rules. Evaluations of linear recurrent models on SelectivBench reveal performance patterns consistent with results from large-scale language tasks. Our analysis clarifies the roles of essential architectural features: gating and rapid forgetting mechanisms facilitate recall, in-state channel mixing is unnecessary for selectivity, but critical for generalization, and softmax attention remains dominant due to its memory capacity scaling with sequence length. Our benchmark enables targeted, efficient exploration of linear recurrent models and provides a controlled setting for studying behaviors observed in large-scale evaluations.

Instead, we propose replacing the softmax with an alternative family of policy parameterizations based on the generalized f-softargmax. We further advocate coupling this parameterization with a regularizer induced by the same f-divergence, which improves the optimization landscape and ensures that the resulting regularized objective satisfies a Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Leveraging this structure, we establish the first explicit non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees for stochastic policy gradient methods for finite MDPs without any form of preconditioning. We also derive sample-complexity bounds for the unregularized problem and show that f-PG, with Tsallis divergences achieves polynomial sample complexity in contrast to the exponential complexity incurred by the standard softmax parameterization."}

This requires $|λ- \\AM| < \\AM$ and diverges when $κ> 4$. We work instead with the moment-generating function $M(t) = \\E[X^t]$ for normalized eigenvalues $X = λ/\\AM$. Since $M'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$, the log-determinant becomes $\\log\\det(A) = n(\\log \\AM + M'(0))$ -- the problem reduces to estimating a derivative at $t = 0$. Trace powers give $M(k)$ at positive integers, but interpolating $M(t)$ directly is ill-conditioned due to exponential growth. The transform $K(t) = \\log M(t)$ compresses this range. Normalization by $\\AM$ ensures $K(0) = K(1) = 0$. With these anchors fixed, we interpolate $K$ through $m+1$ consecutive integers and differentiate to estimate $K'(0)$. However, this local interpolation cannot capture arbitrary spectral features.\n  We prove a fundamental limit: no continuous estimator using finitely many positive moments can be uniformly accurate over unbounded conditioning. Positive moments downweight the spectral tail; $K'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$ is tail-sensitive. This motivates guaranteed bounds. From the same traces we derive upper bounds on $(\\det A)^{1/n}$.

Our approach leverages continuous gene representations aligned with contemporary deep learning scales, incorporates dynamic evolutionary operators with adaptive scheduling, and utilizes a modular PyTorch implementation for seamless integration with modern architectures. Additionally, we ensure the universality of the generated perturbations by testing across diverse models and by periodically switching batches to prevent overfitting.

We term this phenomenon explanation multiplicity: multiple internally valid but substantively different explanations for the same decision. We present a methodology to characterize multiplicity in feature-attribution explanations and to disentangle sources due to model training/selection from stochasticity intrinsic to the explanation pipeline. We further show that apparent stability depends on the metric: magnitude-based distances can remain near zero while rank-based measures reveal substantial churn in the identity and ordering of top features. To contextualize observed disagreement, we derive randomized baseline values under plausible null models. Across datasets, model classes, and confidence regimes, we find explanation multiplicity is pervasive and persists even for high-confidence predictions, highlighting the need for metrics and baselines that match the intended use of explanations."}

Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been used in recent research to perform DBS in a more adaptive manner to improve overall patient outcome.

Our RL agent can tune both frequency and amplitude of DBS signals to the brain with better sample efficiency and requires minimal time to converge. We implement an MAB agent for DBS for the first time on hardware to report energy measurements and prove its suitability for resource-constrained platforms.

A wide range of techniques (from classical statistical models to neural network-based approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) have been employed to address time series forecasting challenges. In this paper, we reframe time series forecasting as a two-part task: (1) predicting the trend (directional movement) of the time series at the next time step, and (2) forecasting the quantitative value at the next time step. The trend can be predicted using a binary classifier, while quantitative values can be forecasted using models such as LSTM and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Building on this reframing, we propose the Trend-Adjusted Time Series (TATS) model, which adjusts the forecasted values based on the predicted trend provided by the binary classifier. We validate the proposed approach through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. The TATS model is applied to a volatile financial time series (the daily gold price) with the objective of forecasting the next days price. Experimental results demonstrate that TATS consistently outperforms standard LSTM and Bi-LSTM models by achieving significantly lower forecasting error. In addition, our results indicate that commonly used metrics such as MSE and MAE are insufficient for fully assessing time series model performance. Therefore, we also incorporate trend detection accuracy, which measures how effectively a model captures trends in a time series."}

These heuristics depend on the \"luck\" of informative samples, lack principled control of the policy, and often yield limited or inconsistent gains. In this work, we are the first to introduce a \\textbf{distribution-centric} perspective for RL, in which exploration is always guided by a \"better\" target distribution, and reveal that a policy's ability to resist entropy collapse is governed by the distribution itself rather than individual samples.

To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting.

While instruction tuning is the prevailing method for adapting pre-trained LLMs to graph learning tasks like node classification, it requires a substantial volume of annotated (INSTRUCTION, OUTPUT) pairs deriving from labeled nodes. This requirement is particularly prohibitive in the social domain, where obtaining expert labels for sensitive or evolving content is costly and slow. Furthermore, standard graph instruction tuning fails to exploit the vast amount of unlabeled nodes, which contain latent correlations due to edge connections that are beneficial for downstream predictions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Instruction Tuning pipeline for Graph Learning, named SIT-Graph. Notably, SIT-Graph is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into any graph instruction tuning method that utilizes LLMs as the predictor. SIT-Graph operates via an iterative self-training process. Initially, the model is fine-tuned using instruction pairs constructed solely from the labeled nodes. Then it generates confidence-filtered pseudo-responses for unlabeled nodes to strategically augment the dataset for the next round of fine-tuning.

Unlike existing methods that operate in Euclidean parameter space, FOPNG projects gradients onto the Fisher-orthogonal complement of previous task gradients. This approach unifies natural gradient descent with orthogonal gradient methods within an information-geometric framework. The resulting update direction is invariant under reparameterization, guarantees descent in the Fisher metric, and helps preserve prior task outputs. We provide theoretical analysis establishing the properties of the projected update, describe efficient and practical implementations using the diagonal Fisher, and demonstrate strong results on standard continual learning benchmarks such as Permuted-MNIST, Split-MNIST, Rotated-MNIST, Split-CIFAR10, and Split-CIFAR100."}

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they struggle to internalize multi hop, logic driven motifs such as fund dispersal and layering that characterize sophisticated money laundering, limiting their forensic accountability under regulations like the FATF Travel Rule. To address this limitation, we propose Relational Domain Logic Integration (RDLI), a framework that embeds expert derived heuristics as differentiable, logic aware latent signals within representation learning. Unlike static rule based approaches, RDLI enables the detection of complex transactional flows that evade standard message passing. To further account for market volatility, we incorporate a Retrieval Grounded Context (RGC) module that conditions anomaly scoring on regulatory and macroeconomic context, mitigating false positives caused by benign regime shifts. Under extreme label scarcity (0.01%), RDLI outperforms state of the art GNN baselines by 28.9% in F1 score. A micro expert user study further confirms that RDLI path level explanations significantly improve trustworthiness, perceived usefulness, and clarity compared to existing methods, highlighting the importance of integrating domain logic with contextual grounding for both accuracy and explainability."}

Simulations are first used to generate training labels, after which the neural network is trained. After training, the neural network provides almost instantaneous predictions of various metrics of the system, such as the stationary distribution of inventory levels, the expected cycle time, and the probability of lost sales. We find that using a small number of low-order moments of the distributions as input is sufficient to train the neural networks and to accurately capture the steady-state distribution. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate high accuracy over a wide range of system parameters. As such, it effectively replaces repeated and costly simulation runs.

It has a high global prevalence and places a significant burden on healthcare systems, especially in resource-limited regions. Automated classification of sickle cells in blood images is crucial, allowing the specialist to reduce the effort required and avoid errors when quantifying the deformed cells and assessing the severity of a crisis. Recent studies have proposed various erythrocyte representation and classification methods. Since classification depends solely on cell shape, a suitable approach models erythrocytes as closed planar curves in shape space. This approach employs elastic distances between shapes, which are invariant under rotations, translations, scaling, and reparameterizations, ensuring consistent distance measurements regardless of the curves' position, starting point, or traversal speed. While previous methods exploiting shape space distances had achieved high accuracy, we refined the model by considering the geometric characteristics of healthy and sickled erythrocytes. Our method proposes (1) to employ a fixed parameterization based on the major axis of each cell to compute distances and (2) to align each cell with two templates using this parameterization before computing distances. Aligning shapes to templates before distance computation, a concept successfully applied in areas such as molecular dynamics, and using a fixed parameterization, instead of minimizing distances across all possible parameterizations, simplifies calculations. This strategy achieves 96.03\\% accuracy rate in both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering.

Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality. Then, we show that using a Student's t likelihood in addition to natural gradient induces a bounded update, which improves robustness to outliers. Finally, we introduce Natural Score-driven Replay (NatSR), which combines our robust optimizer with a replay buffer and a dynamic scale heuristic that improves fast adaptation at regime drifts. Empirical results demonstrate that NatSR achieves stronger forecasting performance than more complex state-of-the-art methods."}

In this setup, the model is expressed as the product of two functions: one depending on the spatial variable and the other on the noise magnitude. This structure limits the model's ability to represent a more general relationship between the spatial variable and the noise, indicating that it cannot fully learn the correct score. Despite this limitation, the models perform well in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by studying the deterministic dynamics of the associated differential equations, offering insight into how the model operates."}

Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers, Helmholtz, Klein-Gordon, and lid-driven cavity flow problems, demonstrate that ACR-PINN achieves faster convergence and significantly lower relative $L_2$ and $L_\\infty$ errors than standard PINNs.

Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we propose PaperCompass, a framework that mitigates these issues by separating high-level planning from fine-grained execution. PaperCompass first drafts an explicit plan that outlines the intended sequence of actions, and then performs detailed reasoning to instantiate each step by selecting the parameters for the corresponding function calls. To train such behavior, we introduce Draft-and-Follow Policy Optimization (DFPO), a tailored RL method that jointly optimizes both the draft plan and the final solution. DFPO can be viewed as a lightweight form of hierarchical reinforcement learning, aimed at narrowing the `knowing-doing' gap in LLMs. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes DFPO's favorable optimization properties, supporting a stable and reliable training process. Experiments on paper-based question answering (Paper-QA) benchmarks show that PaperCompass improves efficiency over strong baselines without sacrificing performance, achieving results comparable to much larger models."}

We term this phenomenon Misaligned Co-drift, which blurs expert responsibilities and exacerbates forgetting.To address this, we introduce the pathway activation subspace (PASs), a LoRA-induced subspace that reflects which low-rank pathway directions an input activates in each expert, providing a capability-aligned coordinate system for routing and preservation. Based on PASs, we propose a fixed-capacity PASs-based MoE-LoRA method with two components: PAS-guided Reweighting, which calibrates routing using each expert's pathway activation signals, and PAS-aware Rank Stabilization, which selectively stabilizes rank directions important to previous tasks. Experiments on a CIT benchmark show that our approach consistently outperforms a range of conventional continual learning baselines and MoE-LoRA variants in both accuracy and anti-forgetting without adding parameters.

Under mild realizability and convexity assumptions, we show that anchored recursive distillation induces contraction in KL divergence, yielding geometric convergence to base teacher distributions and a unique, globally attractive fixed point.\n  The contribution is foundational rather than algorithmic: the framework characterizes when recursive distillation is mathematically well-posed and convergent rather than error-accumulating, independent of model architecture, optimization details, or specific operator instantiations. These results provide a theoretical basis for understanding stability, bias-variance behavior, and failure modes in iterative and multi-teacher distillation under capacity constraints."}

To address this gap, we introduce a pruning strategy that utilizes attention weights to identify tokens emphasized at different stages and estimates their importance. Building on this analysis, FastAV applies a two-stage pruning strategy: (1) global pruning in intermediate layers to remove broadly less influential tokens, and (2) fine pruning in later layers considering the impact on next token generation. Notably, our method does not rely on full attention maps, which makes it fully compatible with efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastAV reduces FLOPs by more than 40% on two representative AV-LLMs, while preserving or even improving model performance."}

Training unfolds as a high-dimensional dynamical system in which small perturbations to optimization, data, parameters, or learning signals can induce abrupt and irreversible collapse, undermining reproducibility and scalability.\n  We propose a unified dynamical perspective that characterizes training stability as an intrinsic property of learning systems, organized along four interacting dimensions: optimization, environmental/data, parametric, and learning-signal stability. We operationalize this perspective through controlled perturbation auditing of training trajectories, probing how learning dynamics respond to structured disturbances without modifying learning algorithms.\n  Across reinforcement learning and large language model training, we identify three recurring regularities: high final performance is frequently decoupled from training stability; controlled stochasticity consistently buffers learning dynamics across paradigms; and deviations in low-dimensional latent meta-states systematically precede observable performance collapse. Together, these findings establish training stability as a measurable and comparable dynamical property of learning systems, providing a descriptive foundation for studying learning dynamics beyond final performance outcomes."}

To tackle this challenge we propose LAViG-FLOW, a latent autoregressive video generation diffusion framework that explicitly learns the coupled evolution of saturation and pressure fields. Each state variable is compressed by a dedicated 2D autoencoder, and a Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT) models their coupled distribution across time. We first train the model on a given time horizon to learn their coupled relationship and then fine-tune it autoregressively so it can extrapolate beyond the observed time window. Evaluated on an open-source CO2 sequestration dataset, LAViG-FLOW generates saturation and pressure fields that stay consistent across time while running orders of magnitude faster than traditional numerical solvers."}

We investigate this by evaluating base and instruction-tuned models on standard math benchmarks, structurally perturbed variants, and domain-shifted tasks. Our analysis highlights two key (often overlooked) limitations of instruction tuning. First, the performance advantage is unstable and depends heavily on evaluation settings. In zero-shot CoT settings on GSM8K, base models consistently outperform instruction-tuned variants, with drops as high as 32.67\\% (Llama3-70B). Instruction-tuned models only match or exceed this performance when provided with few-shot exemplars, suggesting a reliance on specific prompting patterns rather than intrinsic reasoning. Second, tuning gains are brittle under distribution shift. Our results show that base models surpass instruction-tuned variants on the domain-specific MedCalc benchmark. Additionally, instruction-tuned models show sharp declines on perturbed datasets, indicating sensitivity to prompt structure over robust reasoning."}

We show that while RLVR improves task performance, it produces extremely overconfident models, whereas SFT yields substantially better calibration, even under distribution shift, though with smaller performance gains. Through targeted experiments, we diagnose RLVR's failure, showing that decision tokens act as extraction steps of the decision in reasoning traces and do not carry confidence information, which prevents reinforcement learning from surfacing calibrated alternatives.

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence."}

Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction.

We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam. Our analysis reveals that the Muon dynamics decouple into a collection of independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior.

To address these gaps, we develop a novel PRobabilistic variational imputation framework that leverages the power of large lAnguage models and retrIeval-augmented Memory (PRAIM). PRAIM employs a pre-trained language model to encode heterogeneous data, spanning time-series demand, calendar features, and geospatial context, into a unified, semantically rich representation. This is dynamically fortified by retrieval-augmented memory that retrieves relevant examples from the entire charging network, enabling a single, unified imputation model empowered by variational neural architecture to overcome data sparsity.

Numerical experiments on synthetic tensor sensing demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits favorable convergence behavior in wall-clock time compared with representative stochastic tensor recovery baselines."}

However, most existing methods assume regularly sampled observations and fixed output resolutions, which are often misaligned with real-world scenarios where data are irregularly sampled and sparsely observed. This mismatch is particularly problematic in applications such as clinical monitoring, where irregular measurements must support downstream tasks requiring continuous and high-resolution time series.\n  Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) have shown strong potential for modeling irregular time series, yet they still face challenges in capturing complex dynamic temporal patterns and supporting continuous TSG. To address these limitations, we propose MN-TSG, a novel framework that explores Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based NCDEs and integrates them with existing TSG models for irregular and continuous generation tasks.\n  The core of MN-TSG lies in a MoE-NCDE architecture with dynamically parameterized expert functions and a decoupled design that facilitates more effective optimization of MoE dynamics. Furthermore, we leverage existing TSG models to learn the joint distribution over the mixture of experts and the generated time series. This enables the framework not only to generate new samples, but also to produce appropriate expert configurations tailored to each sample, thereby supporting refined continuous TSG.\n  Extensive experiments on ten public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MN-TSG, consistently outperforming strong TSG baselines on both irregular-to-regular and irregular-to-continuous generation tasks."}

Inverting this linear response relationship yields the data intervention that steers the model toward a target internal configuration. We demonstrate patterning in a small language model, showing that re-weighting training data along principal susceptibility directions can accelerate or delay the formation of structure, such as the induction circuit. In a synthetic parentheses balancing task where multiple algorithms achieve perfect training accuracy, we show that patterning can select which algorithm the model learns by targeting the local learning coefficient of each solution.

Here we present LUMOS, a data-and-physics driven framework for inverse design of fluorescent molecules. LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization. Further validation using TD-DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that LUMOS can generate valid fluorophores that meet various target specifications. Overall, these results establish LUMOS as a data-physics dual-driven framework for general fluorophore inverse design."}

This motivates us to propose DRGW, the first graph watermarking framework that addresses these issues through disentangled representation learning. Specifically, we design an adversarially trained encoder that learns an invariant structural representation against diverse perturbations and derives a statistically independent watermark carrier, ensuring both robustness and transparency of watermarks.

By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the principled dynamical structure of SSMs, recent studies have achieved powerful fits to functional neuroimaging data. However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior. To this end, we introduce GeoDynamics, a geometric state-space neural network that tracks latent brain-state trajectories directly on the high-dimensional SPD manifold. GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism. Beyond neuroscience, we validate GeoDynamics on human action recognition benchmarks (UTKinect, Florence, HDM05), demonstrating its scalability and robustness in modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics across diverse domains."}

In this setting, model merging offers a practical mechanism for integrating multiple RL-trained agents from different tasks into a single generalist model. However, existing merging methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and they are suboptimal to preserve task-specific capabilities on RL-trained agentic models. The root is a task-vector mismatch between RL and SFT: on-policy RL induces task vectors that are highly sparse and heterogeneous, whereas SFT-style merging implicitly assumes dense and globally comparable task vectors. When standard global averaging is applied under this mismatch, RL's non-overlapping task vectors that encode critical task-specific behaviors are reduced and parameter updates are diluted. To address this issue, we propose Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM), a distribution-aware merging framework explicitly designed for RL-trained agentic models. RAM disentangles shared and task-specific unique parameter updates, averaging shared components while selectively preserving and rescaling unique ones to counteract parameter update dilution. Experiments across multiple agent domains and model architectures demonstrate that RAM not only surpasses merging baselines, but also unlocks synergistic potential among agents to achieve performance superior to that of specialized agents in their domains."}

Through experiments on three decoder-only transformer architectures spanning 124M to 20B parameters (GPT-2, TinyLlama, and GPT-OSS), we demonstrate that donor transplantation substantially outperforms existing adaptation methods, achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in perplexity over LoRA while training significantly faster. The method exhibits position dependence, with early insertion positions yielding optimal results. Cross-domain transfer at billion-parameter scale reveals unexpected regularization benefits. These findings demonstrate that transformer middle layers can support efficient modular transfer for decoder-only architectures, enabling privacy-preserving expertise sharing through checkpoint distribution. We note that this approach is currently limited to decoder-only models; preliminary experiments on encoder-based architectures show reduced effectiveness."}

A residual convolutional neural network is employed to approximate the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) within the global operational system of China Meteorological Administration. We adopted an offline training and online coupling approach. First, a comprehensive dataset is generated through model simulations, encompassing all atmospheric columns both with and without cloud cover. To ensure the stability of the hybrid model, the dataset is enhanced via experience replay, and additional output constraints based on physical significance are imposed. Meanwhile, a LibTorch-based coupling method is utilized, which is more suitable for real-time operational computations. The hybrid model is capable of performing ten-day integrated forecasts as required. A two-month operational reforecast experiment demonstrates that the machine learning emulator achieves accuracy comparable to that of the traditional physical scheme, while accelerating the computation speed by approximately eightfold."}

Across nonlinear function regression, PDE learning, and image classification, FIPA consistently improves over averaging-based aggregation, and can be effectively combined with state-of-the-art client-side optimization algorithms to further improve image classification accuracy.

Building on Universal Physics Transformers, our approach operates directly on large-scale mesh data and is trained on an extensive dataset generated from nonlinear finite element simulations, covering a broad spectrum of temporal instrument-tissue interaction scenarios. To reduce the accumulation of errors in autoregressive inference, we propose a stochastic teacher forcing strategy applied during model training. Specifically, training consists of short stochastic rollouts in which the proportion of ground truth inputs is gradually decreased in favor of model-generated predictions. Our results show that the proposed surrogate model achieves accurate and efficient predictions across a range of transient brain deformation scenarios, scaling to meshes with up to 150,000 nodes. The introduced stochastic teacher forcing technique substantially improves long-term rollout stability, reducing the maximum prediction error from 6.7 mm to 3.5 mm.

Inspired by latent diffusion in other modalities, a natural idea is to compress graphs into a low-dimensional latent space and perform diffusion there. However, unlike images or text, graph generation requires nearly lossless reconstruction, as even a single error in decoding an adjacency matrix can render the entire sample invalid. This challenge has remained largely unaddressed. We propose LG-Flow, a latent graph diffusion framework that directly overcomes these obstacles. A permutation-equivariant autoencoder maps each node into a fixed-dimensional embedding from which the full adjacency is provably recoverable, enabling near-lossless reconstruction for both undirected graphs and DAGs. The dimensionality of this latent representation scales linearly with the number of nodes, eliminating the quadratic bottleneck and making it feasible to train larger and more expressive models. In this latent space, we train a Diffusion Transformer with flow matching, enabling efficient and expressive graph generation. Our approach achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art graph diffusion models, while achieving up to $1000\\times$ speed-up."}

As autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems become increasingly prevalent, the need for accurate and reliable ETA estimation has grown, playing a vital role in navigation, mobility planning, and traffic management. However, predicting ETA remains a challenging task due to the dynamic and complex nature of traffic flow. Traditional methods often combine real-time and historical traffic data in simplistic ways, or rely on complex rule-based computations. While recent deep learning models have shown potential, they often require high computational costs and do not effectively capture the spatio-temporal patterns crucial for ETA prediction. ETA prediction inherently involves spatio-temporal causality, and our proposed model addresses this by leveraging attention mechanisms to extract and utilize temporal features accumulated at each spatio-temporal point along a route. This architecture enables efficient and accurate ETA estimation while keeping the model lightweight and scalable. We validate our approach using real-world driving datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines by effectively integrating road characteristics, real-time traffic conditions, and historical speed patterns in a task-aware manner."}

ELSA introduces three key innovations. First, it employs a task-agnostic, behavior-aware client clustering mechanism that constructs semantic fingerprints using public probe inputs and symmetric KL divergence, further enhanced by prediction-consistency-based trust scoring and latency-aware edge assignment to jointly address data heterogeneity, client unreliability, and communication constraints. Second, it splits the LLM into three parts across clients and edge servers, with the cloud used only for adapter aggregation, enabling an effective balance between on-device computation cost and global convergence stability. Third, it incorporates a lightweight communication scheme based on computational sketches combined with semantic subspace orthogonal perturbation (SS-OP) to reduce communication overhead while mitigating privacy leakage during model exchanges.

In this work, we show that the activation pattern of a SOM - the squared distances to its prototypes - can be inverted to recover the exact input under mild geometric conditions. This follows from a classical fact in Euclidean distance geometry: a point in $D$ dimensions is uniquely determined by its distances to $D{+}1$ affinely independent references. We derive the corresponding linear system and characterize the conditions under which the inversion is well-posed. Building upon this mechanism, we introduce the Manifold-Aware Unified SOM Inversion and Control (MUSIC) update rule, which enables controlled, semantically meaningful trajectories in latent space. MUSIC modifies squared distances to selected prototypes while preserving others, resulting in a deterministic geometric flow aligned with the SOM's piecewise-linear structure. Tikhonov regularization stabilizes the update rule and ensures smooth motion on high-dimensional datasets. Unlike variational or probabilistic generative models, MUSIC does not rely on sampling, latent priors, or encoder-decoder architectures. If no perturbation is applied, inversion recovers the exact input; when a target cluster or prototype is specified, MUSIC produces coherent semantic variations while remaining on the data manifold. This leads to a new perspective on data augmentation and controllable latent exploration based solely on prototype geometry. We validate the approach using synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the MNIST and the Faces in the Wild dataset. Across all settings, MUSIC produces smooth, interpretable trajectories that reveal the underlying geometry of the learned manifold, illustrating the advantages of SOM-based inversion over unsupervised clustering."}

In this paper, we close this gap by leveraging LLMs as surrogate models and candidate samplers inside a structured hierarchical search strategy. By adaptively partitioning the input space into disjoint hyperrectangular regions and ranking them with a composite score function, we restrict the generative process of the LLM to specific, high-potential sub-spaces, hence making the problem easier to solve as the LLM doesn't have to reason about the global structure of the problem, but only locally instead. We show that under standard regularity assumptions, our algorithm generates candidate solutions that converge to the true Pareto set in Hausdorff distance. Empirically, it consistently outperforms the global LLM-based multi-objective optimizer and is on par with standard evolutionary and Bayesian optimization algorithm on synthetic and real-world benchmarks."}

A persistent challenge in tractography is accurately reconstructing white matter tracts while minimizing spurious connections. To address this, we propose TractRLFusion, a novel GPT-based policy fusion framework that integrates multiple RL policies through a data-driven fusion strategy.

We adapt this framework to logic synthesis, adding column-sign modulation to enable Boolean negation -- a capability absent in standard doubly stochastic routing.\n  We validate our approach across four phases of increasing complexity: (1) For n=2 (16 Boolean operations over 4-dim basis), gradient descent achieves 100% accuracy with zero routing drift and zero-loss quantization to ternary masks. (2) For n=3 (10 three-variable operations), gradient descent achieves 76% accuracy, but exhaustive enumeration over 3^8 = 6561 configurations proves that optimal ternary masks exist for all operations (100% accuracy, 39% sparsity).

We introduce Linearized Subspace Refinement (LSR), a general and architecture-agnostic framework that exploits the Jacobian-induced linear residual model at a fixed trained network state. By solving a reduced direct least-squares problem within this subspace, LSR computes a subspace-optimal solution of the linearized residual model, yielding a refined linear predictor with substantially improved accuracy over standard gradient-trained solutions, without modifying network architectures, loss formulations, or training procedures. Across supervised function approximation, data-driven operator learning, and physics-informed operator fine-tuning, we show that gradient-based training often fails to access this attainable accuracy, even when local linearization yields a convex problem. This observation indicates that loss-induced numerical ill-conditioning, rather than nonconvexity or model expressivity, can constitute a dominant practical bottleneck. In contrast, one-shot LSR systematically exposes accuracy levels not fully exploited by gradient-based training, frequently achieving order-of-magnitude error reductions. For operator-constrained problems with composite loss structures, we further introduce Iterative LSR, which alternates one-shot LSR with supervised nonlinear alignment, transforming ill-conditioned residual minimization into numerically benign fitting steps and yielding accelerated convergence and improved accuracy.

The approach isolates technology-specific effects by holding the observed speed profile and environmental context fixed, enabling direct comparison of powertrain performance. Recurrent neural network models are trained independently for each domain to learn the mapping from contextual driving variables (speed, acceleration, temperature) to internal actuation variables (torque, throttle) and instantaneous CO2-equivalent emission rates. This structure allows the construction of counterfactual scenarios that answer: What emissions would an EV have generated if it had followed the same driving profile as an ICEV? By aligning both vehicle types on a unified instantaneous emissions metric, the framework enables fair and reproducible evaluation of powertrain technologies. It offers a scalable foundation for credible, data-driven assessments of vehicle carbon performance under real-world operating conditions."}

This renders standard weight-privatization methods (e.g. DP-SGD) unnecessarily noisy at the cost of utility. While model weights may vary significantly across training datasets, model responses to specific inputs are much lower dimensional and more stable. This motivates enforcing privacy guarantees directly on model outputs.\n  We approach this under PAC privacy, which provides instance-based privacy guarantees for arbitrary black-box functions by controlling mutual information (MI). Importantly, PAC privacy explicitly rewards output stability with reduced noise levels. However, a central challenge remains: response privacy requires composing a large number of adaptively chosen, potentially adversarial queries issued by untrusted users, where existing composition results on PAC privacy are inadequate. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves adversarial composition via adaptive noise calibration and prove that mutual information guarantees accumulate linearly under adaptive and adversarial querying.\n  Experiments across tabular, vision, and NLP tasks show that our method achieves high utility at extremely small per-query privacy budgets. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 87.79% accuracy with a per-step MI budget of $2^{-32}$. This enables serving one million queries while provably bounding membership inference attack (MIA) success rates to 51.08% -- the same guarantee of $(0.04, 10^{-5})$-DP. Furthermore, we show that private responses can be used to label public data to distill a publishable privacy-preserving model; using an ImageNet subset as a public dataset, our model distilled from 210,000 responses achieves 91.86% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with MIA success upper-bounded by 50.49%, which is comparable to $(0.02,10^{-5})$-DP."}

Causal feature selection can enhance the performance of soft sensor models in industrial applications. However, existing methods ignore two critical characteristics of industrial processes. Firstly, causal relationships between variables always involve time delays, whereas most causal feature selection methods investigate causal relationships in the same time dimension. Secondly, variables in industrial processes are often interdependent, which contradicts the decorrelation assumption of traditional causal inference methods. Consequently, soft sensor models based on existing causal feature selection approaches often lack sufficient accuracy and stability. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a causal feature selection framework based on time-delayed cross mapping. Time-delayed cross mapping employs state space reconstruction to effectively handle interdependent variables in causality analysis, and considers varying causal strength across time delay. Time-delayed convergent cross mapping (TDCCM) is introduced for total causal inference, and time-delayed partial cross mapping (TDPCM) is developed for direct causal inference. Then, in order to achieve automatic feature selection, an objective feature selection strategy is presented. The causal threshold is automatically determined based on the model performance on the validation set, and the causal features are then selected. Two real-world case studies show that TDCCM achieves the highest average performance, while TDPCM improves soft sensor stability and performance in the worst scenario.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs.

Comparative experiments with neural networks demonstrate that TPBS models outperform neural networks in the overfitting regime for most datasets, and maintain competitive performance otherwise.

The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted.

Under DPO, each arriving customer is offered a single recommended pickup point, rather than an unrestricted choice among all locations, while retaining the option of home delivery. We study this problem in a dynamic and stochastic setting, where the pickup point offered to each customer depends on previously realized customer locations and delivery choices. To design effective DPO policies, we adopt a reinforcement learning-based approach that accounts for spatial relationships between customers and pickup points and their implications for future route consolidation. Computational experiments show that differentiated pickup point offerings can substantially reduce total carbon emissions. The proposed policies reduce total emissions by up to 9% relative to home-only delivery and by 2% on average compared with alternative policies, including unrestricted pickup point choice and nearest pickup point assignment. Differentiated offerings are particularly effective in dense urban settings with many pickup points and short inter-location distances. Moreover, explicitly accounting for the dynamic nature of customer arrivals and choices is especially important when customers are less inclined to choose pickup point delivery over home delivery."}

However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b."}

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL."}

A commonly adopted strategy applies FP8 precision during rollout while retaining BF16 precision for training. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of FP8 RL training and demonstrate that the widely used BF16-training + FP8-rollout strategy suffers from severe training instability and catastrophic accuracy collapse under long-horizon rollouts and challenging tasks. Our analysis shows that these failures stem from the off-policy nature of the approach, which introduces substantial numerical mismatch between training and inference. Motivated by these observations, we propose Jet-RL, an FP8 RL training framework that enables robust and stable RL optimization. The key idea is to adopt a unified FP8 precision flow for both training and rollout, thereby minimizing numerical discrepancies and eliminating the need for inefficient inter-step calibration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Jet-RL: our method achieves up to 33% speedup in the rollout phase, up to 41% speedup in the training phase, and a 16% end-to-end speedup over BF16 training, while maintaining stable convergence across all settings and incurring negligible accuracy degradation."}

We analyze the tracking performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its momentum variants (Polyak heavy-ball and Nesterov) under uniform strong convexity and smoothness in varying stepsize regimes. We derive finite-time bounds in expectation and with high probability for the tracking error, establishing a sharp decomposition into three components: a transient initialization term, a noise-induced variance term, and a drift-induced tracking lag. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a fundamental trade-off: while momentum can suppress gradient noise, it incurs an explicit penalty on the tracking capability. We show that momentum can substantially amplify drift-induced tracking error, with amplification that becomes unbounded as the momentum parameter approaches one, formalizing the intuition that using 'stale' gradients hinders adaptation to rapid regime shifts. Complementing these upper bounds, we establish minimax lower bounds for dynamic regret under gradient-variation constraints. These lower bounds prove that the inertia-induced penalty is not an artifact of analysis but an information-theoretic barrier: in drift-dominated regimes, momentum creates an unavoidable 'inertia window' that fundamentally degrades performance. Collectively, these results provide a definitive theoretical grounding for the empirical instability of momentum in dynamic environments and delineate the precise regime boundaries where SGD provably outperforms its accelerated counterparts."}

In the federated setting with $M$ agents, we prove that collaboration reduces the per-agent sample complexity to $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|\\|h^{\\star}\\|_{\\mathsf{sp}}^3}{M\\varepsilon^3}\\right)$, with only $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{\\|h^{\\star}\\|_{\\mathsf{sp}}}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$ communication rounds required. These results establish the first federated Q-learning algorithm for average-reward MDPs, with provable efficiency in both sample and communication complexity."}

Existing work provides various finite-sample estimators of the MMD variance, often differing under the null and alternative hypotheses and across balanced or imbalanced sampling schemes. In this paper, we study the variance of the MMD statistic through its U-statistic representation and Hoeffding decomposition, and establish a unified finite-sample characterization covering different hypotheses and sample configurations. Building on this analysis, we propose an exact acceleration method for the univariate case under the Laplacian kernel, which reduces the overall computational complexity from $\\mathcal O(n^2)$ to $\\mathcal O(n \\log n)$."}

Probabilistic forecasts are needed to plan the inventory levels; the predictive distribution should cover non-negative values, have a mass in zero and a long upper tail. Intermittent time series are commonly forecast using local models, which are trained individually on each time series. In the last years global models, which are trained on a large collection of time series, have become popular for time series forecasting. Global models are often based on neural networks. However, they have not yet been exhaustively tested on intermittent time series. We carry out the first study comparing state-of-the-art local (iETS, TweedieGP) and global models (D-Linear, DeepAR, Transformers) on intermittent time series. For neural networks models we consider three different distribution heads suitable for intermittent time series: negative binomial, hurdle-shifted negative binomial and Tweedie. We use, for the first time, the last two distribution heads with neural networks. We perform experiments on five large datasets comprising more than 40'000 real-world time series. Among neural networks D-Linear provides best accuracy; it also consistently outperforms the local models. Moreover, it has also low computational requirements. Transformers-based architectures are instead much more computationally demanding and less accurate. Among the distribution heads, the Tweedie provides the best estimates of the highest quantiles, while the negative binomial offers overall the best performance."}
