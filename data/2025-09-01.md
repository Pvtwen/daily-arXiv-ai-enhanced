### [1] [A Framework of Arithmetic-Level Variable Precision Computing for In-Memory Architecture: Case Study in MIMO Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21079)
*Kaixuan Bao,Wei Xu,Xiaohu You,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了算术级可变精度计算(AL-VPC)框架，通过优化每个算术运算的计算精度，在无线通信中平衡计算性能和计算复杂度，相比传统固定精度方法可实现60%的和速率提升或30%的复杂度降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 可变精度计算为无线通信中的计算复杂度问题提供了新的解决方案，通过优化每个算术运算的精度配置，能够显著提升性能或降低复杂度。

Abstract: Computational complexity poses a significant challenge in wireless
communication. Most existing attempts aim to reduce it through
algorithm-specific approaches. However, the precision of computing, which
directly relates to both computing performance and computational complexity, is
a dimension that is fundamental but rarely explored in the literature. With the
emerging architecture of in-memory computing, variable precision computing
(VPC) is enabled, allowing each arithmetic operation to be processed with a
distinct and specifically optimized computing precision. In this paper, we
establish a unified framework of arithmetic-level variable precision computing
(AL-VPC), which aims to determine the optimized computing precision for each
arithmetic operation. We first develop an arithmetic propagation error model
exploiting stochastic analysis, and then formulate a mathematical optimization
problem to strike balance between computing performance and computational
complexity. Two algorithms, namely, offline VPC and online VPC, are proposed to
solve the problem considering various practical concerns. Particularly, in a
case study on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we reveal the Pareto boundary
between computing performance and complexity, which exhibits up to a 60%
sum-rate enhancement or equivalently up to a 30% complexity reduction compared
to the traditional fixed-length methods.

*Alireza Fadakar,Yuchen Zhang,Hui Chen,Musa Furkan Keskin,Henk Wymeersch,Andreas F. Molisch*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 电磁可重构流体天线系统通过动态控制天线辐射模式，在MISO系统中显著提升用户设备定位精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注ER-FAS在频谱效率方面的应用，本文探索其在下行链路定位中的潜力，通过联合基带和电磁预编码器设计来最小化用户位置误差

Method: 提出两种可重构范式：合成模型（从有限电磁基函数生成所需波束模式）和有限状态选择模型（从预定义模式集中选择），分别推导低维闭式表达式和低复杂度块坐标下降算法

Result: 分析边界和大量仿真表明，所提出的ER-FAS混合设计相比传统不可重构阵列显著提高了UE定位精度

Conclusion: ER-FAS通过电磁域的动态控制为无线定位提供了新的自由度，在定位精度方面展现出显著优势

Abstract: Electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna systems (ER-FAS) introduce
additional degrees of freedom in the electromagnetic (EM) domain by dynamically
steering per-antenna radiation patterns, thereby enhancing power efficiency in
wireless links. Unlike prior works on spatially reconfigurable FAS, which
adjust element positions, ER-FAS provides direct control over each element's EM
characteristics to realize on-demand beam-pattern shaping. While existing
studies have exploited ER-FAS to boost spectral efficiency, this paper explores
its application for downlink localization. We consider a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) system in which a multi-antenna ER-FAS at the base station
serves a single-antenna user equipment (UE). We consider two reconfigurability
paradigms: (i) a synthesis model where each antenna generates desired
beampatterns from a finite set of EM basis functions, and (ii) a finite-state
selection model in which each antenna selects a pattern from a predefined set
of patterns. For both paradigms, we formulate the joint baseband (BB) and EM
precoder design to minimize the UE position error bound. In the synthesis case
we derive low-dimensional closed-form expressions for both the BB and EM
precoders. For the finite-state model we obtain closed-form BB structures and
propose a low-complexity block-coordinate-descent algorithm for EM pattern
selection. Analytical bounds and extensive simulations show that the proposed
hybrid designs for ER-FAS substantially improve UE positioning accuracy over
traditional non-reconfigurable arrays.

### [3] [Channel Estimation and Data Detection in DS-Spread Channels: A Unified Framework, Novel Algorithms, and Waveform Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21373)
*Niladri Halder,Chandra R. Murthy*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的接收机处理框架，用于水下声学通信中的延迟-尺度扩散通道，对OFDM、OTFS、OCDM和ODSS四种调制波形进行公平对比研究，并提出了新的迭代变分贝叶斯额外网格频道估计算法和低复杂度软符号检测算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下声学通信中存在延迟-尺度扩散通道挑战，需要一个统一的框架来处理不同调制波形的频道估计和数据检测问题，并进行公平的性能比较。

Method: 开发了一种新的迭代变分贝叶斯额外网格频道估计算法（FVB和SVB），以及低复杂度变分软符号检测算法（VSSD）。还提出了数据辅助迭代频道估计和数据检测方案（ICED）。

Result: 数值结果显示了提出算法的有效性。在无编码通信中，ODSS表现最好，其次是OCDM和OTFS，OFDM表现最差。但在编码通信中，使用VSSD接收机时所有波形都提供近似的BER性能。

Conclusion: 当接收机复杂度受限时，波形选择很重要，特别是在严峻的通道条件下。但使用更复杂的接收机算法时，不同波形间的性能差异会消失。

Abstract: We present a unified receiver processing framework for communication over
delay-scale (DS)-spread channels that arise in underwater acoustic (UWA)
communications that addresses both channel estimation (CE) and data detection
for different modulation waveforms, namely OFDM, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS, through
a common input--output relation. Using this framework, we conduct a fair and
comprehensive comparative study of these waveforms under DS-spread UWA channels
and similar receiver complexities.
  We also develop a novel iterative variational Bayesian (VB) off-grid CE
algorithm to estimate the delay and scale parameters of the channel paths, via
two approaches: a first-order approximation scheme (FVB) and a second-order
approximation scheme (SVB). We propose a low-complexity variational soft symbol
detection (VSSD) algorithm that outputs soft symbols and log-likelihood ratios
for the data bits, and a data-aided iterative CE and data detection (ICED)
scheme that utilizes detected data symbols as \emph{virtual} pilots to further
improve the CE and data detection accuracy.
  Our numerical results reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithms for CE
and data detection. In terms of relative performance of different waveforms, in
uncoded communications, (a) with a low-complexity subcarrier-by-subcarrier
equalizer, ODSS offers the best performance, followed by OCDM and OTFS, while
OFDM performs the worst, and (b) with the VSSD algorithm, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS
perform similarly, and they outperform OFDM. With coded communications,
interestingly, all waveforms offer nearly the same BER when the VSSD receiver
is employed. Hence, we conclude that when the receiver complexity is
constrained, waveform choice matters, especially under harsh channel
conditions, whereas with more sophisticated receiver algorithms, these
differences disappear.

### [4] [Sampling Theory of Jointly Bandlimited Time-vertex Graph Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21412)
*Hang Sheng,Hui Feng,Junhao Yu,Feng Ji,Bo Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了时间-顶点图信号(TVGS)的临界采样问题，提出了针对连续时间信号、无限长序列和有限长序列三种TVGS类型的采样密度下界，并设计了相应的采样和重建方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间-顶点图信号模型用于描述具有不规则结构的时变数据，其联合时间-顶点傅里叶谱域的带限特性反映了时间和图拓扑上的平滑性。需要研究如何以最小采样密度完美恢复这类信号。

Method: 通过分析联合时间-顶点傅里叶谱域的谱支撑测度，推导了三种TVGS类型的采样密度下界，提出了相应的采样和重建算法，并在数值和真实数据集上进行了验证。

Result: 证明了联合带限TVGS的采样密度下界，该下界取决于联合谱域的谱支撑测度，并给出了每个顶点采样集的最小采样密度要求。

Conclusion: 提出的采样方案能够实现临界采样，为时间-顶点图信号的高效采样和重建提供了理论框架和实用方法。

Abstract: Time-vertex graph signal (TVGS) models describe time-varying data with
irregular structures. The bandlimitedness in the joint time-vertex Fourier
spectral domain reflects smoothness in both temporal and graph topology. In
this paper, we study the critical sampling of three types of TVGS including
continuous-time signals, infinite-length sequences, and finite-length sequences
in the time domain for each vertex on the graph. For a jointly bandlimited
TVGS, we prove a lower bound on sampling density or sampling ratio, which
depends on the measure of the spectral support in the joint time-vertex Fourier
spectral domain. We also provide a lower bound on the sampling density or
sampling ratio of each vertex on sampling sets for perfect recovery. To
demonstrate that critical sampling is achievable, we propose the sampling and
reconstruction procedures for the different types of TVGS. Finally, we show how
the proposed sampling schemes can be applied to numerical as well as real
datasets.

### [5] [Subset Random Sampling and Reconstruction of Finite Time-Vertex Graph Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21415)
*Hang Sheng,Qinji Shu,Hui Feng,Bo Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了针对有限时间-顶点图信号的子集随机采样方案，通过先选择行列子矩阵再内部随机采样，结合低秩、稀疏性和平滑性先验进行重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机采样方法可能在任何顶点和时间采样，但实际应用中采样通常限于顶点和时间子集，需要更实用的采样策略

Method: 先随机选择行列子集形成子矩阵，然后在子矩阵内进行随机采样，结合LSSP（低秩、稀疏性、平滑性）先验的重建框架

Result: 理论提供了高概率重建原始信号的充分条件，实验验证了重建可行性和框架有效性

Conclusion: 提出的子集随机采样方案解决了实际采样限制问题，LSSP重建框架在未知频谱支持情况下有效实现了FTVGS的重建

Abstract: Finite time-vertex graph signals (FTVGS) provide an efficient representation
for capturing spatio-temporal correlations across multiple data sources on
irregular structures. Although sampling and reconstruction of FTVGS with known
spectral support have been extensively studied, the case of unknown spectral
support requires further investigation. Existing random sampling methods may
extract samples from any vertex at any time, but such strategies are not
friendly in practice, where sampling is typically limited to a subset of
vertices and moments. To address this requirement, we propose a subset random
sampling scheme for FTVGS. Specifically, we first randomly select a subset of
rows and columns to form a submatrix, followed by random sampling within that
submatrix. In theory, we provide sufficient conditions for reconstructing the
original FTVGS with high probability. Additionally, we introduce a
reconstruction framework incorporating low-rank, sparsity, and smoothness
priors (LSSP), and verify the feasibility of the reconstruction and the
effectiveness of the framework through experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑机接口系统在帮助个体恢复自由方面具有潜力，但脑电图数据的解释仍然是一个复杂且未解决的问题，特别是在运动想象脑机接口中准确分类左右想象运动方面存在挑战。

Method: 研究开发了一个新颖的机器学习管道，采用受试者内模型训练方法，对每个个体受试者分别训练分类模型，能够识别左、右想象运动以及休息状态。

Result: 在52名受试者的运动想象任务中，该框架实现了99.5%的分类准确率，与当前最先进的四种研究方法相比表现出色。

Conclusion: 提出的框架因其故障安全分类性能，可以用于运动想象脑机接口系统，为脑机接口应用提供了可靠的分类解决方案。

Abstract: Motor Imagery-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) are systems that
detect and interpret brain activity patterns linked to the mental visualization
of movement, and then translate these into instructions for controlling
external robotic or domotic devices. Such devices have the potential to be
useful in a broad variety of applications. While implementing a system that
would help individuals restore some freedom levels, the interpretation of
(Electroencephalography) EEG data remains a complex and unsolved problem. In
the literature, the classification of left and right imagined movements has
been extensively studied. This study introduces a novel pipeline that makes use
of machine learning techniques for classifying MI EEG data. The entire
framework is capable of accurately categorizing left and imagined motions, as
well as rest phases, for a set of 52 subjects who performed a MI task. We
trained a within subject model on each individual subject. The methodology has
been offline evaluated and compared to four studies that are currently the
state-of-the-art regarding the specified dataset. The results show that our
proposed framework could be used with MI-BCI systems in light of its failsafe
classification performances, i.e. 99.5% in accuracy

TL;DR: 提出了一种叫PCFM的闭式GN/EGN模型，通过多项式表达通道功率分布来实现超快速和高精度的光学传输系统模拟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要超快速且准确的物理层模型来设计、优化和管理超宽带光学传输系统

Method: 将每个通道在光纤段中的空间功率分布表达为多项式，然后在合理近似下进行积分计算，得到分析解

Result: 在包括拉曼增益和通道间拉曼散射的多带(C+L+S)场景中，与数值积分GN模型验证显示了很好的准确性，同时在多个集中损耗情况下也表现良好

Conclusion: PCFM模型具有很好的准确性和广泛的适用性，并提供了可以根据任何系统布局进行重配置的软件实现

Abstract: Ultrafast and accurate physical layer models are essential for designing,
optimizing and managing ultra-wideband optical transmission systems. We present
a closed-form GN/EGN model, named Polynomial Closed-Form Model (PCFM),
improving reliability, accuracy, and generality. The key to deriving PCFM is
expressing the spatial power profile of each channel along a span as a
polynomial. Then, under reasonable approximations, the integral calculation can
be carried out analytically, for any chosen degree of the polynomial. We
present a full detailed derivation of the model. We then validate it vs. the
numerically integrated GN-model in a challenging multiband (C+L+S) scenario,
including Raman amplification and inter-channel Raman scattering. We then show
that the approach works well also in the special case of the presence of
multiple lumped loss along the fiber. Overall, the approach shows very good
accuracy and broad applicability. A software implementing the model, fully
reconfigurable to any type of system layout, is available for download under

### [8] [Energy Detection over Composite $κ-μ$ Shadowed Fading Channels with Inverse Gaussian Distribution in Ultra mMTC Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21614)
*He Huang,Zeping Sui,Zilong Liu,Wei Huang,Md. Noor-A-Rahim,Haishi Wang,Zhiheng Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了6G mMTC网络中基于κ-μ阴影衰落信道的能量检测特性，首次推导了截断形式的平均检测概率闭式表达式，发现传播路径数比平均SNR对检测概率影响更大


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究6G超大规模机器类型通信网络中能量检测在复合κ-μ阴影衰落信道下的性能特征，为网络设计提供理论指导

Method: 基于逆高斯分布推导SNR的概率密度函数闭式表达式，采用新颖的积分和数学变换技术，首次推导截断形式的平均检测概率闭式表达式

Result: 仿真显示传播路径数比平均SNR对平均检测概率的影响更显著，这与之前针对设备到设备网络的研究结论相反

Conclusion: 6G mMTC网络设计应重点优化发射机-接收机布局和天线对准策略，而非单纯提高设备间平均SNR

Abstract: This paper investigates the characteristics of energy detection (ED) over
composite $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed fading channels in ultra machine-type
communication (mMTC) networks. We have derived the closed-form expressions of
the probability density function (PDF) of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on
the Inverse Gaussian (\emph{IG}) distribution. By adopting novel integration
and mathematical transformation techniques, we derive a truncation-based
closed-form expression for the average detection probability for the first
time. It can be observed from our simulations that the number of propagation
paths has a more pronounced effect on average detection probability compared to
average SNR, which is in contrast to earlier studies that focus on
device-to-device networks. It suggests that for 6G mMTC network design, we
should consider enhancing transmitter-receiver placement and antenna alignment
strategies, rather than relying solely on increasing the device-to-device
average SNR.

### [9] [On the Deployment of Multiple Radio Stripes for Large-Scale Near-Field RF Wireless Power Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21640)
*Amirhossein Azarbahram,Onel L. A. López,Petar Popovski,Matti Latva-aho*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究室内近场无线能量传输系统，通过分组算法和天线部署优化来最大化热点区域的最小接收功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内无线能量传输中能量需求聚集在特定热点区域的问题，提高能量传输效率和覆盖范围。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先进行基于空间位置和近场传播特性的分组，然后进行天线元素布局优化，提出四种部署算法包括SCA、SGP、直线形和正多边形部署。

Result: 数值结果显示分组算法有效收敛，优化部署在各种频率和天线长度下都超过基准方案，正多边形部署表现最佳，直线形部署在高单元增益设置下体现优势。

Conclusion: 该研究为室内近场无线能量传输系统提供了有效的部署解决方案，特别是正多边形部署在大多数情况下表现最好，为实际应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This paper investigates the deployment of radio stripe systems for indoor
radio-frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) in line-of-sight near-field
scenarios. The focus is on environments where energy demand is concentrated in
specific areas, referred to as 'hotspots', spatial zones with higher user
density or consistent energy requirements. We formulate a joint clustering and
radio stripe deployment problem that aims to maximize the minimum received
power across all hotspots. To address the complexity, we decouple the problem
into two stages: i) clustering for assigning radio stripes to hotspots based on
their spatial positions and near-field propagation characteristics, and ii)
antenna element placement optimization. In particular, we propose four radio
stripe deployment algorithms. Two are based on general successive convex
approximation (SCA) and signomial programming (SGP) methods. The other two are
shape-constrained solutions where antenna elements are arranged along either
straight lines or regular polygons, enabling simpler deployment. Numerical
results show that the proposed clustering method converges effectively, with
Chebyshev initialization significantly outperforming random initialization. The
optimized deployments consistently outperform baseline benchmarks across a wide
range of frequencies and radio stripe lengths, while the polygon-shaped
deployment achieves better performance compared to other approaches. Meanwhile,
the line-shaped deployment demonstrates an advantage under high boresight gain
settings, benefiting from increased spatial diversity and broader angular
coverage.

*Haozhe Tian,Qiyu Rao,Nina Moutonnet,Pietro Ferraro,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出序列匹配滤波器(SMF)方法，使用强化学习设计滤波器序列，解决低信噪比信号中传统匹配滤波器性能下降的问题，在ECG信号检测中取得先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统匹配滤波器在低信噪比信号中性能下降，特别是在边缘设备记录的信号中，噪声模式可能与目标信号相似，如耳部心电图信号衰减严重且受伪影污染。

Method: 提出序列匹配滤波器(SMF)范式，用强化学习代理设计的滤波器序列替代传统单匹配滤波器，将滤波器设计建模为序列决策过程，自适应设计信号特定的滤波器序列。

Conclusion: SMF框架具有可靠和可解释的临床决策支持潜力，可扩展到需要从噪声污染信号中准确定位模式的广泛应用。

Abstract: Matched filters are widely used to localise signal patterns due to their high
efficiency and interpretability. However, their effectiveness deteriorates for
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge
devices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within
the limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram
(ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by
artefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a
paradigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence
of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter
design as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design
signal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing
key patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong
potential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as
demonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state
classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The
proposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that
require accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals.

### [11] [Beyond expected value: geometric mean optimization for long-term policy performance in reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21443)
*Xinyi Sheng,Dominik Baumann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合期望累积奖励和时间平均增长率的新型强化学习算法，通过几何平均和滑动窗口估计器来优化个体轨迹的长期性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL算法优化期望累积奖励（无限轨迹的平均性能），但实际部署时个体轨迹性能更重要，需要优化个体轨迹的长期表现

Method: 定义了时间平均增长率的Bellman算子，在乘法奖励动态下使用几何平均，针对一般未知奖励动态提出带N滑动窗口的修正几何平均作为估计器，并将其作为正则化器嵌入目标函数

Result: 在具有挑战性的模拟环境中评估，算法优于传统RL方法

Conclusion: 成功开发了同时受益于集合平均和时间平均的实用RL算法，能够更好地优化个体轨迹的长期性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种混合字符串相似性、主题建模和层次聚类的方法来解决银行支付消息中交易对手方的聚类问题，充分考虑了手工输入的噪声和变体特点，在真实数据集上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 在真实标签数据集上进行测试，显示出较基准线规则方法（关键字匹配）有显著的性能提升，同时保持了解释性，减少了手动审查的需求。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了银行支付消息中交易对手方聚类的挑战，在制裁调查等场景下能够更好地控制漏掉实体变体的风险，为资金追踪和反欺诈工作提供了有力的工具支持。

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的成员推断攻击方法Gen-LRA，专门针对表格生成模型的过拟合问题，无需模型知识或访问权限，通过测试观测对假模型本地可能性比估计的影响来审计合成数据泄漏隐私的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的合成数据隐私审计框架依赖经验法则和不合理假设，在描述和检测通过合成数据发布泄漏训练数据隐私方面能力有限。表格生成模型往往在训练分布的某些区域显著过拟合，这为成员推断攻击提供了新的攻击角度。

Method: 提出Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA)，一种计算高效的No-Box MIA方法。该方法不需模型知识或访问权限，通过评估测试观测对假模型在合成数据上本地可能性比估计的影响来构建攻击。

Result: 在涉及多种数据集、模型架构和攻击参数的全面基准测试中，Gen-LRA在多个性能指标上一贵领先于其他生成模型MIA方法。

Conclusion: Gen-LRA作为一种有效的隐私审计工具，显著地揭示了生成模型过拟合在实际应用中带来的重大隐私风险。

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

TL;DR: PVPO是一种高效的强化学习方法，通过优势参考锚点和数据预采样来解决无评论家强化学习方法中的局部最优和高计算成本问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无评论家强化学习方法（特别是群体策略）严重依赖策略内的多重采样和比较来估计优势，这可能导致策略陷入局部最优并增加计算成本

Method: 使用参考模型提前进行rollout，并将计算得到的奖励分数作为参考锚点。该方法有效纠正了组内比较引入的累积偏差，并显著减少了对rollout次数的依赖。同时，参考模型可以在数据预采样期间评估样本难度，有效选择高增益数据来提高训练效率

Result: 在跨两个领域的九个数据集上进行的实验表明，PVPO实现了最先进的性能。该方法不仅在多个任务上表现出强大的泛化能力，还在不同规模的模型上展现出可扩展的性能

Conclusion: PVPO通过优势参考锚点和数据预采样的创新方法，有效解决了无评论家强化学习方法的关键问题，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著提升

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息神经网络(PINNs)是求解偏微分方程的流行方法，通常使用随机梯度下降算法训练。现有研究主要分析确定性梯度下降，而随机优化方法的收敛性保证对于实际应用至关重要。

Method: 通过分析随机梯度下降/流的动态过程，确保在训练过程中合适的Gram矩阵保持正定性，从而处理随机优化方法引入的动态随机性。

Result: 建立了过参数化两层PINNs在使用随机梯度下降训练时的高概率线性收敛性，适用于一般类别的激活函数。

Conclusion: 该分析揭示了优化过程的动态特性，为通过随机算法训练的神经网络提供了理论保证，扩展了现有确定性优化方法的收敛性结果。

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaGram是一种高效的全矩阵自适应梯度优化器，通过快速对称分解和低秩近似来降低计算和内存开销，在保持性能的同时实现比对角自适应方法更快的收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自适应梯度方法（如Adagrad）使用对角预处理矩阵，无法捕捉参数相关性。全矩阵自适应方法虽然能建模这些相关性，但计算和内存成本过高，限制了在大规模模型中的应用。

Method: 提出AdaGram优化器，采用快速对称分解计算预处理更新方向，并使用矩阵积分器方法保持预处理器的低秩结构，从而降低内存和计算开销。

Result: 在标准机器学习任务上的数值实验表明，AdaGram在使用秩5及更小秩近似时，收敛速度比对角自适应优化器更快或相当。

Conclusion: AdaGram为大规模模型中的自适应优化提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，能够在保持性能的同时显著降低计算和内存需求。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of
temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model
Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing
temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three
variables. Historical meteorological data (2019-2022) with encoded cyclical
time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization.
The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature),
31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming
state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks.
Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights
revealed temporal patterns, enhancing interpretability. By combining
multivariate forecasting, attention-based DL, and explainability, this work
advances data-driven weather prediction. The demonstrated accuracy and
transparency highlight the framework's potential for energy-efficient building
control through reliable short-term meteorological forecasting.

Motivation: DSN天线和发射器随时间退化可能导致数据流中断，威胁依赖该网络的数十个航天器的地球连接，需要开发能够直接定位异常和设备退化的方法。

Method: 研究采用机器学习技术进行数据重建和预测分析，使用统计计算和阈值确定实时数据集中的异常数据，集成强化学习子系统按严重程度分类异常，并利用大语言模型为每个异常数据条目提供解释标签。

Result: 实现了完整的数据管道系统，连接数据提取、解析和处理工作流，将DSN天线数据的训练模型整合到DSN异常检测的数据工作流中，并通过智能AI系统进行复杂推理。

Conclusion: 该系统能够协助JPL工程师进行DSN的维护和操作，为未来的太空任务提供支持，所有组件都可以通过人类反馈/输入随时间改进和微调。

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

TL;DR: 本文提出PILOT方法，将LLM路由建模为上下文多臂老虎机问题，通过共享嵌入空间和在线学习实现自适应模型选择，同时考虑成本约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法假设已知最优查询-模型配对，但现实场景缺乏完整映射且查询不断变化，需要自适应决策方案。

Method: 构建查询和LLM的共享嵌入空间，使用离线人类偏好数据初始化，通过LinUCB扩展算法PILOT进行在线优化，并引入多选择背包问题处理成本约束。

Result: 提出的PILOT方法能够在不需要对所有LLM进行完整推理的情况下，实现自适应路由决策，同时有效管理资源成本。

Conclusion: 将LLM路由建模为上下文老虎机问题是有效的，PILOT方法通过结合离线和在线学习，实现了高效且成本感知的自适应模型选择。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

Conclusion: DeepResESN通过残差连接有效提升了长期时序建模能力，为未训练循环神经网络提供了新的深度架构设计思路

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

Motivation: 形式化理解大语言模型解码过程的数学基础，为常见的"流形遍历"直觉提供严格的理论框架，并推导出面向实践的具体结论。

Method: 使用约束变分原理和概率单纯形上的离散上升方法（乘法权重/熵镜像更新），分析其连续时间极限（复制子流），建立解码过程的数学理论。

Result: 证明了在固定上下文和温度下，下一个token分布沿光滑轨迹收敛到softmax均衡；温度是时间的精确重缩放；top-k和nucleus采样将流限制在具有相同保证的面上。

Conclusion: 为大语言模型解码过程提供了严格的数学框架，形式化了常见的直觉理解，并得出了具有实践指导意义的精确结论，为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

Motivation: 近期RL应用于LLMs的报告显示了许多反直觉现象，但这些现象的有效条件尚不明确。研究旨在确定这些观察结果成立的关键因素和边界条件。

Method: 通过系统性和全面的实验验证，在不同模型架构和任务领域中检验一系列反直觉主张，重点关注模型-任务对齐程度（以pass@k准确率衡量）的影响。

Result: 研究发现标准RL训练在各种设置下始终保持稳健，而许多反直觉结果仅在模型与任务已呈现强对齐时出现。在更具挑战性的情况下，这些技术无法驱动实质性学习。

Conclusion: 模型-任务对齐是区分RL观察结果的关键因素。虽然反直觉方法在对齐良好时有效，但标准RL方法在更广泛的情况下保持可靠性和有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate

multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

*Farnoush Rezaei Jafari,Oliver Eberle,Ashkan Khakzar,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Relevance Patching (RelP) 是一种新的机制解释性方法，通过使用层间相关性传播(LRP)系数替代梯度，在保持计算效率的同时，比标准属性修补更准确地近似激活修补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活修补是机制解释性中的标准方法但计算成本高，属性修补虽然更快但存在噪声问题且在深度非线性网络中可靠性降低，需要一种既高效又准确的方法。

Method: 提出Relevance Patching (RelP)，用Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)的传播系数替代属性修补中的局部梯度，仅需两次前向传播和一次反向传播。

Result: 在多个模型和任务上验证显示，RelP比标准属性修补更准确地近似激活修补，特别是在IOI任务中分析残差流和MLP输出时，GPT-2 Large上相关性从0.006提升到0.956。

Conclusion: RelP在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了修补的准确性，为大规模机制解释性分析提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

TL;DR: FedOwen是一个高效的联邦学习框架，使用Owen采样来近似Shapley值，在相同评估预算下比现有方法误差更小，并通过自适应客户端选择策略实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中准确估计客户端贡献对于公平奖励和选择有用客户端至关重要，但精确计算Shapley值在客户端数量大时计算复杂度指数增长，不可行。

Method: 提出FedOwen框架，使用Owen采样近似Shapley值，采用自适应客户端选择策略平衡利用高价值客户端和探索未充分采样的客户端。

Result: 在相同评估成本下，FedOwen在非IID基准测试中比最先进基线方法获得高达23%的最终准确率提升。

Conclusion: FedOwen通过高效的Shapley值近似和智能客户端选择，显著提升了联邦学习的性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

*Roland Arnold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Guess-and-Learn (G&L) v1.0 是一个评估机器学习模型冷启动适应性的新框架，通过测量模型在顺序标注未标记数据集时累积的错误来评估适应成本，而不仅仅是最终准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的机器学习模型评估过于强调最终准确率，忽略了模型从零开始学习过程中的适应成本（累积错误）。G&L旨在填补这一空白，量化模型在早期学习阶段的错误成本。

Method: G&L定义了四个评估轨道（Scratch/Pretrained × Online/Batch），通过让学习者在每个步骤选择实例、预测标签、接收真实标签并更新参数的方式，测量错误轨迹。使用MNIST和AG News数据集，测试了从经典方法到预训练变换器的多种模型。

Result: 实验显示小模型在早期阶段能以更少的初始错误适应，预训练的好处因领域而异。所有当前模型都远高于oracle参考带，显示出明显的适应性差距。

Conclusion: G&L通过量化早期学习的错误成本，补充了传统基准测试，为开发不仅最终准确而且从一开始就可靠的学习者提供了可复现的框架。

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CALM框架通过持续微调和LLM辅助判断，实现了非平稳时间序列流中的实时异常检测，有效应对概念漂移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线训练的异常检测模型在面对概念漂移时性能显著下降，需要开发能够实时适应数据变化的检测方法

Method: 基于Apache Beam分布式处理框架和TimesFm基础模型，采用闭环持续微调机制和LLM-as-a-Judge组件进行语义异常判断

Result: 在TSB-UAD基准测试中，持续微调模型相比静态预训练模型在大多数数据集上提升了ROC AUC分数

Conclusion: CALM框架通过自适应和LLM引导的方法，在动态流环境中保持了高性能的异常检测能力

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌电信号固有的非平稳性使得域偏移检测成为重大挑战，需要开发有效的方法来识别不同受试者和记录会话之间的域变化，以提高肌电解码模型的稳定性和实用性。

Method: 使用Ninapro数据库的DB6数据集，将域定义为基于不同受试者和记录会话的时间序列段，应用带余弦核的KPCA进行预处理以突出域偏移，并评估CUSUM、Page-Hinckley和ADWIN等多种漂移检测方法。

Result: 研究结果显示当前技术在实现肌电信号实时域偏移检测的高性能方面存在局限性，现有漂移检测方法的表现不够理想。

Conclusion: 流式方法在维持稳定肌电解码模型方面具有潜力，但需要进一步研究来提高在真实世界场景中的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: MyGO是一个受生物睡眠-觉醒周期启发的终身学习框架，通过生成式记忆模型和离线知识蒸馏来缓解灾难性遗忘，无需存储原始数据，在隐私和存储效率方面具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有持续学习方法面临的隐私保护、存储限制和任务差异导致的性能下降问题，避免存储原始样本的需求。

Method: 采用觉醒-睡眠双阶段框架：觉醒阶段快速学习新任务并训练紧凑生成模型；睡眠阶段使用所有生成模型生成伪数据，通过知识蒸馏将新旧知识整合到核心特征提取器中。

Result: 在计算机视觉(Split-MNIST)和自然语言处理(Split-AG News)基准测试中，MyGO显著缓解了灾难性遗忘，保持了跨任务的高平均准确率。

Conclusion: MyGO框架有效解决了持续学习中的关键挑战，证明了其在不同领域的通用性和有效性，为隐私敏感的终身学习应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VILA是一种新型的机器遗忘框架，通过更准确地识别与敏感信息相关的参数并避免访问整个模型，相比现有方法FILA实现了100倍的参数效率和40倍的训练速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型容易无意中生成敏感信息，传统重新训练方法计算成本过高，而现有的FILA方法虽然参数高效但仍需要访问所有模型参数且Fisher信息估计不准确。

Method: 提出VILA框架，明确考虑FILA忽略的Fisher信息基本假设，提高遗忘集参数识别准确性，同时无需访问整个模型参数，显著降低计算成本。

Result: 在TOFU、WMDP和MUSE基准测试中达到最先进性能，相比FILA实现100倍参数效率提升和40倍训练速度提升。

Conclusion: VILA通过改进参数识别准确性和计算效率，为机器遗忘提供了更有效的解决方案，在保护隐私的同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at

*Amit Sinha,Matthieu Geist,Aditya Mahajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个分析Q-learning算法收敛性的理论框架，针对使用代理状态（非信念状态）和策略正则化的实际算法，证明了在温和条件下收敛到正则化MDP的固定点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际中常用的Q-learning算法具有两个重要特征：使用代理状态（如RNN状态）进行递归更新，以及使用策略正则化来鼓励探索和稳定学习。需要理论分析这类算法的收敛性。

Method: 研究最简单的正则化代理状态Q-learning算法(RASQL)，分析其在温和技术条件下的收敛性，并扩展到学习周期性策略的变体。

Result: 证明RASQL收敛到适当定义的正则化MDP的固定点，该固定点取决于行为策略诱导的平稳分布。数值实验验证了理论收敛行为。

Conclusion: 为实际中常用的带有代理状态和正则化的Q-learning算法提供了收敛性理论保证，填补了理论分析与实际算法之间的差距。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sampled-SAE是一种改进的稀疏自编码器方法，通过评分特征列并形成候选池，在批次级别和令牌特定选择之间提供可调平衡，解决了BatchTopK的激活彩票问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的TopK SAE方法效率低下，因为不同令牌携带的信息量不同。BatchTopK虽然提高了平均重建效果，但存在"激活彩票"问题，即罕见的高幅度特征会挤掉信息丰富但幅度较低的特征。

Method: 提出Sampled-SAE方法：对批次激活矩阵的列（代表特征）进行评分（使用L2范数或熵），形成大小为Kl的候选池，然后在受限的特征池中对批次中的令牌应用Top-K选择。通过调整l参数，可以在批次级别和令牌特定选择之间进行调节。

Result: 在Pythia-160M模型上的实验表明，没有单一的l值能在所有指标上达到最优，最佳选择取决于共享结构、重建保真度和下游性能之间的权衡。

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE将BatchTopK重新构建为一个可调的、分布感知的方法族，提供了在全局一致性和细粒度重建之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

TL;DR: Stage-Diff是一个基于扩散模型的分阶段生成模型，专门用于生成长时间序列，通过分阶段序列生成和阶段间信息传递来平衡长期依赖和数据分布漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时间序列具有复杂的长期时间模式和分布漂移，同时包含复杂的特征序列间相互关系，现有生成模型在处理这些挑战时存在困难。

Method: 采用分阶段序列生成和阶段间信息传递来保持长期序列依赖并建模数据分布漂移；在每个阶段内使用渐进序列分解进行通道独立建模，阶段间使用多通道融合建模。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验验证了Stage-Diff在长时间序列生成任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: Stage-Diff通过结合通道独立建模的鲁棒性和多通道建模的信息融合优势，有效平衡了长时间序列的序列内和序列间依赖关系。

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

Conclusion: DLGAN是一个简单但有效的生成模型，能够有效解决时间序列合成中的时间依赖性和特征捕获问题

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10等基准测试中 consistently优于SGD和其他基于噪声的方法，在SVHN等噪声数据集上表现尤其突出，加速早期训练并提高泛化能力

Conclusion: AHTSGD是首个基于Edge of Stability现象调整注入噪声特性的算法，能够有效促进收敛到宽盆地，提高模型泛化性能和对学习率选择的鲁棒性

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

Conclusion: PMODE提供了一个通用且模块化的混合建模框架，即使在组件来自不同分布族时仍保持有效性，并能成功扩展到高维应用。

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and
modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric
components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate
estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator
class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different
distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a
previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

TL;DR: CoM是一种新的模型融合方法，通过自回归方式逐层更新激活统计量，有效解决深度网络中跨层依赖性问题，在标准基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的模型融合技术通常独立处理每一层，忽略了深度网络中固有的层间依赖关系，导致分布不匹配问题，特别是在基于激活的方法中。

Method: 提出Chain of Merges (CoM)方法，采用自回归方式的逐层融合过程，显式地考虑跨层交互，通过一系列条件最优更新来产生连贯的融合模型。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，CoM方法实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: CoM通过有效缓解协变量偏移引起的性能退化，为预训练模型融合提供了一种更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 混合量子/经典GAN方法在检测突发料源变异导致的异常时显示出更高的异常检测率

Conclusion: 混合量子/经典方法在复杂连续生物制造过程中具有解决实际问题的潜力

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图数据规模扩大，双曲空间等黎曼流形数据空间受到关注。传统NML主要在欧几里得空间中定义，且依赖于坐标系选择，难以直接扩展到黎曼流形。

Method: 定义了反映黎曼流形几何结构的新NML方法（Rm-NML），扩展了现有NML计算技术到黎曼流形设置，并推导了在黎曼对称空间上简化计算的方法。

Result: Rm-NML具有坐标变换不变性，在欧几里得空间自然参数化下与传统NML一致。在双曲空间上的正态分布中成功计算了Rm-NML。

Conclusion: 提出的Rm-NML方法为黎曼流形上的模型选择和遗憾最小化提供了几何感知的解决方案，特别适用于具有层次结构的图数据分析。

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

Conclusion: 失败预测是设计和评估早期退出模型的更可靠基础，它能够更准确地预测模型的效率改善效果。

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

Conclusion: SNN-DT通过将序列建模与神经形态效率相结合，为嵌入式设备和可穿戴设备开辟了实时低功耗控制的途径

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

Conclusion: 需要开发有效的表格数据表示方法和公平性感知模型，以提高LLM在金融决策中的可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

Conclusion: 虽然技术上可行，但数据最小化在实践中仍面临挑战，其对技术和用户上下文的依赖性使得建立通用的数据"必要性"标准很困难

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15

anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure
equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory
prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions
(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a
paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven
flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid
control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware
architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

Motivation: 海洋盐度对环流、气候和海洋生态系统至关重要，但现有测量方法存在数据稀疏、不规则、噪声大等问题，传统线性方法和机器学习模型都有明显局限性。

Method: 开发OceAn Salinity Imputation System (OASIS)，一种新颖的扩散对抗框架，能够处理稀疏数据并整合物理协变量。

Result: 论文提出了新的框架，但具体实验结果需要在正文中进一步展示。

Conclusion: OASIS框架为解决海洋盐度数据插补问题提供了新的解决方案，有望克服传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine
ecosystems, yet its measurement is often sparse, irregular, and noisy,
especially in drifter-based datasets. Traditional approaches, such as remote
sensing and optimal interpolation, rely on linearity and stationarity, and are
limited by cloud cover, sensor drift, and low satellite revisit rates. While
machine learning models offer flexibility, they often fail under severe
sparsity and lack principled ways to incorporate physical covariates without
specialized sensors. In this paper, we introduce the OceAn Salinity Imputation
System (OASIS), a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address
these challenges.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

TL;DR: 使用情感和时间特征预测社交媒体参与度的机器学习方法，在点赞预测上表现优异（R²=0.98），但评论预测效果较差（R²=0.41），表明评论受更多未捕获因素影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用情感和时间元数据来预测社交媒体内容（特别是音乐）的参与度（点赞和评论），探索情感特征对用户参与行为的影响

Method: 基于600首歌曲数据集，使用情感标注（效价、唤醒度等）和时间特征，采用HistGradientBoostingRegressor多目标回归模型，对偏斜的参与度目标进行对数变换处理

Result: 模型在点赞预测上达到R²=0.98的优异表现，但在评论预测上仅获得R²=0.41，表明点赞主要受情感和曝光信号驱动，而评论受其他未捕获因素影响更大

Conclusion: 情感和时间元数据结合现有浏览量能有效预测未来参与度，特别是点赞行为；评论预测的挑战表明需要纳入更多特征来捕捉用户生成内容的复杂性

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保深度学习模型在真实应用中的可靠性，需要有效区分训练分布内(ID)和分布外(OOD)样本，特别是在不同分布偏移程度下的检测挑战

Method: 使用分类头权重矩阵的奇异值分解，将模型激活分解为决定性分量（对分类输出贡献最大）和无关分量（贡献最小）。在远分布偏移时利用无关分量，在近分布偏移时利用决定性分量

Result: 在多个标准OOD基准测试中取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 通过分析激活空间的不同分量，ActSub方法能够有效处理不同分布偏移程度的OOD检测问题，提升检测性能

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个统计学习框架，将纵向回归断点设计（LRDD）从传统预测扩展到预测未来时间特异性事件对社区心理健康的影响，特别是在焦虑评分中的断点和斜率变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 估计地方事件对社区心理健康的特异性影响对公共卫生政策至关重要。传统的心理健康评分预测无法充分揭示事件对社区福祉的影响，需要更因果性的分析方法。

Method: 将LRDD方法扩展到统计学习框架中，利用地点的评分历史、动态协变量（其他运行评估）和外生变量（静态表征）来预测未来的断点和斜率变化。应用于COVID-19事件对美国县焦虑评分的影响预测。

Result: 研究发现预测任务具有挑战性，但随着模型复杂度的增加而变得更可行。最佳结果来自整合外生和动态协变量，相比传统静态社区表征有显著改进（断点预测r=+0.46，斜率预测r=+0.65）。

Conclusion: 断点预测为估计未来或假设事件对特定社区的异质性影响提供了新的可能性，展示了统计学习框架在公共卫生政策制定中的价值。

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LCLS-II自由电子激光器产生高达1TB/s的数据流，传统机器学习方法延迟过高，需要专门的高性能实时数据处理解决方案。

Method: 开发SLAC神经网络库(SNL)框架，支持FPGA上的实时ML推理，模型权重可动态更新无需重新合成；并创建Auto-SNL工具将Python神经网络模型自动转换为SNL兼容代码。

Result: 在Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA上的基准测试显示，SNL在多数神经网络架构中达到竞争性或更优的延迟性能，某些情况下还能节省FPGA资源。

Conclusion: SNL框架展现出强大适应性，为高能物理、医学成像、机器人等多个领域的研究人员提供了新的实时数据处理机会。

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多标签排序方法只利用正负标签二分信息，忽略了正标签间的排序信息，无法有效建模类别的重要性差异。

Method: 提出UniMLR框架，通过正标签的排序来建模隐式类别相关性概率分布，并创建了8个合成数据集（Ranked MNISTs）来解决数据稀缺和标注偏差问题。

Result: 统计证明该方法能准确学习与真实排序一致的正标签排序表示，且与底层重要性值成比例。在真实和合成数据集上的实验验证了框架的价值。

Conclusion: UniMLR通过利用正标签排序信息，为多标签排序提供了更统一和有效的解决方案，合成数据集也为该领域研究提供了更好的实验环境。

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

Motivation: 心率预测在现实部署中面临数据异质性挑战，包括设备源异质性（不同设备特征集不同）和用户异质性（不同用户生理模式差异），现有方法无法同时处理这两种异质性

Method: 使用随机特征丢弃策略处理源异质性，使模型对多种特征集具有鲁棒性；使用时序注意力模块捕捉长期生理特征，结合对比学习目标构建判别性表示空间

Result: 在新建的ParroTao数据集和公开FitRec数据集上，模型性能分别提升17%和15%，学习到的表示具有很强的判别能力

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效处理心率预测中的数据异质性问题，学习到的表示在下游任务中具有实用价值

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

TL;DR: MoE-Health是一个新颖的混合专家框架，用于处理医疗保健中多模态数据融合问题，能够有效应对不同模态可用性的临床预测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实医疗系统产生多样化的多模态数据（EHR、临床笔记、医学影像），但真实世界样本往往存在模态缺失或不完整的问题。现有方法通常需要完整模态数据或依赖人工选择策略，限制了在临床环境中的实际应用。

Method: 提出MoE-Health框架，采用专门的专家网络和动态门控机制，根据可用数据模态动态选择和组合相关专家，实现对不同数据可用性场景的灵活适应。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上的三个关键临床预测任务（院内死亡率预测、长期住院、再入院预测）中，MoE-Health相比现有多模态融合方法表现出更优越的性能，并在不同模态可用性模式下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效整合多模态信息，在处理异构和不完整医疗数据方面提供改进的预测性能和鲁棒性，特别适合部署在具有异构数据可用性的多样化医疗环境中。

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

TL;DR: QR-LoRA是一种参数高效的微调方法，通过QR分解提取预训练权重的正交基，仅训练标量系数来大幅减少可训练参数数量，在GLUE任务上性能优于全微调和标准LoRA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA变体使用SVD初始化更新矩阵，但SVD在大模型上计算昂贵且奇异向量难以解释，需要更高效和结构化的参数高效微调方法。

Method: 使用QR分解与列主元法从预训练权重矩阵提取正交基，将LoRA更新表示为这些基向量的线性组合，仅训练标量系数。

Result: 在GLUE任务上，QR-LoRA仅用601个参数就达到或超过全微调、标准LoRA和SVD-LoRA的性能，参数减少量相比全微调超过1000倍，比典型LoRA设置少77倍。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA通过正交基分解提供了结构化的参数高效微调方案，在极少量参数下实现优异性能，为大规模语言模型的高效适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GDPR、HIPAA等隐私法规和AI责任框架的实施，真实数据的使用面临更多限制。合成数据生成成为敏感领域数据共享和模型开发的有前景解决方案，但需要同时兼顾隐私保护和公平性。

Method: 使用Transformer-based VAE和潜在扩散模型生成表格数据；通过Rényi差分隐私(RDP)约束训练保护隐私；在输入空间使用RDP兼容的平衡采样处理公平性；在潜在空间使用Centered Kernel Alignment(CKA)对齐不同保护组的神经元激活模式。

Result: 实证结果表明，FLIP在差分隐私约束下，能够有效提供显著的任务无关公平性改进，并在多种下游任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: FLIP方法在隐私保护和公平性之间取得了良好平衡，为任务无关的公平数据生成提供了有效的解决方案，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

Abstract: Comparing probability distributions is a core challenge across the natural,
social, and computational sciences. Existing methods, such as Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD), struggle in high-dimensional and non-compact domains. Here
we introduce quantum probability metrics (QPMs), derived by embedding
probability measures in the space of quantum states: positive, unit-trace
operators on a Hilbert space. This construction extends kernel-based methods
and overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an
integral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly
approximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$,
offering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high
dimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using
eigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and
optimization. Although computationally more intensive for large sample sizes
($O(n^3)$ vs. $O(n^2)$), QPMs can significantly improve performance as a
drop-in replacement for MMD, as demonstrated in a classic generative modeling
task. By combining the rich mathematical framework of quantum mechanics with
classical probability theory, this approach lays the foundation for powerful
tools to analyze and manipulate probability measures.

Abstract: Support points summarize a large dataset through a smaller set of
representative points that can be used for data operations, such as Monte Carlo
integration, without requiring access to the full dataset. In this sense,
support points offer a compact yet informative representation of the original
data. We build on this idea to introduce a generative modeling framework based
on random weighted support points, where the randomness arises from a weighting
scheme inspired by the Dirichlet process and the Bayesian bootstrap. The
proposed method generates diverse and interpretable sample sets from a fixed
dataset, without relying on probabilistic modeling assumptions or neural
network architectures. We present the theoretical formulation of the method and
develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on the Convex--Concave
Procedure (CCP). Empirical results on the MNIST and CelebA-HQ datasets show
that our approach produces high-quality and diverse outputs at a fraction of
the computational cost of black-box alternatives such as Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) or Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). These
results suggest that random weighted support points offer a principled,
scalable, and interpretable alternative for generative modeling. A key feature
is their ability to produce genuinely interpolative samples that preserve
underlying data structure.

Abstract: An adaptive bandwidth selection procedure for the mixture kernel in the
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for fitting generative moment matching networks
(GMMNs) is introduced, and its ability to improve the learning of copula random
number generators is demonstrated. Based on the relative error of the training
loss, the number of kernels is increased during training; additionally, the
relative error of the validation loss is used as an early stopping criterion.
While training time of such adaptively trained GMMNs (AGMMNs) is similar to
that of GMMNs, training performance is increased significantly in comparison to
GMMNs, which is assessed and shown based on validation MMD trajectories,
samples and validation MMD values. Superiority of AGMMNs over GMMNs, as well as
typical parametric copula models, is demonstrated in terms of three
applications. First, convergence rates of quasi-random versus pseudo-random
samples from high-dimensional copulas are investigated for three functionals of
interest and in dimensions as large as 100 for the first time. Second,
replicated validation MMDs, as well as Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo
applications based on the expected payoff of a basked call option and the risk
measure expected shortfall as functionals are used to demonstrate the improved
training of AGMMNs over GMMNs for a copula model fitted to the standardized
residuals of the 50 constituents of the S&P 500 index after deGARCHing. Last,
both the latter dataset and 50 constituents of the FTSE~100 are used to
demonstrate that the improved training of AGMMNs over GMMNs and in comparison
to the fitting of classical parametric copula models indeed also translates to
an improved model prediction.
