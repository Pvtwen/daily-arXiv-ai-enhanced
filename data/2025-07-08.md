### [1] [Biaxialformer: Leveraging Channel Independence and Inter-Channel Correlations in EEG Signal Decoding for Predicting Neurological Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02879)
*Naimahmed Nesaragi,Hemin Ali Qadir,Per Steiner Halvorsen,Ilangko Balasingham*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Biaxialformer是一种基于Transformer的两阶段注意力框架，用于同时建模EEG信号的时空特征，解决了传统通道独立模型的局限性，显著提升了神经预后预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于Transformer的通道独立模型在EEG信号分析中忽略了通道间相关性，导致信息丢失和预测精度下降。Biaxialformer旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Biaxialformer，通过两阶段注意力框架分别捕捉时空特征，结合位置编码和可变感受野的token化模块，并利用双极EEG信号增强空间特征提取。

Result: 在跨医院场景下，Biaxialformer的平均AUC为0.7688，AUPRC为0.8643，F1为0.6518，验证了其鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: Biaxialformer通过建模时空特征和通道间相关性，显著提升了EEG信号分析的性能，为神经预后预测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Accurate decoding of EEG signals requires comprehensive modeling of both
temporal dynamics within individual channels and spatial dependencies across
channels. While Transformer-based models utilizing channel-independence (CI)
strategies have demonstrated strong performance in various time series tasks,
they often overlook the inter-channel correlations that are critical in
multivariate EEG signals. This omission can lead to information degradation and
reduced prediction accuracy, particularly in complex tasks such as neurological
outcome prediction. To address these challenges, we propose Biaxialformer,
characterized by a meticulously engineered two-stage attention-based framework.
This model independently captures both sequence-specific (temporal) and
channel-specific (spatial) EEG information, promoting synergy and mutual
reinforcement across channels without sacrificing CI. By employing joint
learning of positional encodings, Biaxialformer preserves both temporal and
spatial relationships in EEG data, mitigating the interchannel correlation
forgetting problem common in traditional CI models. Additionally, a
tokenization module with variable receptive fields balance the extraction of
fine-grained, localized features and broader temporal dependencies. To enhance
spatial feature extraction, we leverage bipolar EEG signals, which capture
inter-hemispheric brain interactions, a critical but often overlooked aspect in
EEG analysis. Our study broadens the use of Transformer-based models by
addressing the challenge of predicting neurological outcomes in comatose
patients. Using the multicenter I-CARE data from five hospitals, we validate
the robustness and generalizability of Biaxialformer with an average AUC
0.7688, AUPRC 0.8643, and F1 0.6518 in a cross-hospital scenario.

### [2] [Cross-Comparison of Neural Architectures and Data Sets for Digital Self-Interference Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03109)
*Gerald Enzner,Niklas Knaepper,Aleksej Chinaev*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文评估了不同神经网络模型在全双工通信中自干扰消除的性能，发现Hammerstein模型表现良好且参数较少，新提出的Wiener-Hammerstein模型进一步提升了泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究全双工通信中自干扰的建模与消除，尤其是数字域中的非线性问题，神经网络是潜在的解决方案。

Method: 利用合成和真实数据评估并交叉比较不同来源的神经网络自干扰模型。

Result: Hammerstein模型在多种数据集上表现良好且参数较少，新提出的Wiener-Hammerstein模型进一步提升了泛化性能。

Conclusion: Hammerstein和Wiener-Hammerstein模型在全双工通信自干扰消除中具有优势，尤其是后者在泛化能力上的提升。

Abstract: Inband full-duplex communication requires accurate modeling and cancellation
of self-interference, specifically in the digital domain. Neural networks are
presently candidate models for capturing nonlinearity of the self-interference
path. This work utilizes synthetic and real data from different sources to
evaluate and cross-compare performances of previously proposed neural
self-interference models from different sources. The relevance of the analysis
consists in the mutual assessment of methods on data they were not specifically
designed for. We find that our previously proposed Hammerstein model represents
the range of data sets well, while being significantly smaller in terms of the
number of parameters. A new Wiener-Hammerstein model further enhances the
generalization performance.

### [3] [Enhancing Satellite Quantum Key Distribution with Dual Band Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03246)
*Muhammad Khalil,Ke Wang,Jinho Choi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型混合卫星通信系统架构，结合量子密钥分发（QKD）和经典射频（RF）数据传输，利用双频段可重构智能表面（RIS）实现实时优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足全球安全可靠通信的需求，通过量子光学链路的安全性和经典RF链路的鲁棒性，构建统一框架。

Method: 采用频率选择性RIS，实时独立优化量子（850 nm）和经典（S波段）信道，动态适应环境变化，如大气湍流和雨衰。通过QUBO问题联合优化QBER和SNR，利用量子与经典计算方法实现自适应相位控制。

Result: 性能显著提升：QBER从2.5%降至0.7%，安全密钥率（SKR）超过30,000比特/秒，经典RF SNR在高仰角下提高约3 dB。

Conclusion: 展示了混合RIS辅助卫星链路在提供高效、安全、鲁棒的全球通信方面的实际潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel system architecture for hybrid satellite
communications, integrating quantum key distribution (QKD) and classical radio
frequency (RF) data transmission using a dual-band reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS). The motivation is to address the growing need for global,
secure, and reliable communications by leveraging the security of quantum
optical links and the robustness of classical RF channels within a unified
framework. By employing a frequency-selective RIS, the system independently
optimizes both quantum (850 nm) and classical (S-band) channels in real time,
dynamically adapting to environmental fluctuations such as atmospheric
turbulence and rain attenuation. The joint optimization of the quantum bit
error rate (QBER) and the classical signal-to noise ratio (SNR) is formulated
as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling
efficient adaptive phase control utilizing both quantum and classical
computational methods. Comprehensive theoretical modeling and simulations,
benchmarked against experimental data from the Micius satellite, demonstrate
substantial performance gains. Notably, the RIS assisted system reduces QBER
from approximately 2.5% to 0.7%, increases the secure key rate (SKR) to over
30,000 bits per second, and enhances classical RF SNR by about 3 dB at high
elevation angles. These results illustrate the practical potential of hybrid
RIS-assisted satellite links to deliver robust, efficient, and secure global
communications.

*Yuqi Ye,Li You,Hao Xu,Ahmed Elzanaty,Kai-Kit Wong,Xiqi Gao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于流体天线系统（FAS）的多用户MIMO通信中的SAR问题，提出了一种双层迭代算法以最小化SAR值，同时满足SINR和FAS约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G网络的发展，需要创新技术满足更高性能指标，但电磁辐射（EM）的潜在危害引起关注。

Method: 提出双层迭代算法，最小化SAR值，并研究SAR约束下的最小加权SINR最大化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，提出的SAR感知FAS设计优于自适应回退和固定位置天线设计。

Conclusion: SAR感知的FAS设计在满足性能需求的同时，有效降低了电磁辐射风险。

Abstract: With the development of the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks,
there is a pressing need for innovative technologies capable of satisfying
heightened performance indicators. Fluid antenna system (FAS) is proposed
recently as a promising technique to achieve higher data rates and more
diversity gains by dynamically changing the positions of the antennas to form a
more desirable channel. However, worries regarding the possibly harmful effects
of electromagnetic (EM) radiation emitted by devices have arisen as a result of
the rapid evolution of advanced techniques in wireless communication systems.
Specific absorption rate (SAR) is a widely adopted metric to quantify EM
radiation worldwide. In this paper, we investigate the SAR-aware multiuser
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications assisted by FAS. In
particular, a two-layer iterative algorithm is proposed to minimize the SAR
value under signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and FAS constraints.
Moreover, the minimum weighted SINR maximization problem under SAR and FAS
constraints is studied by finding its relationship with the SAR minimization
problem. Simulation results verify that the proposed SAR-aware FAS design
outperforms the adaptive backoff and fixed-position antenna designs.

### [5] [UWB TDoA Error Correction using Transformers: Patching and Positional Encoding Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03523)
*Dieter Coppens,Adnan Shahid,Eli De Poorter*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的TDoA定位校正方法，利用所有可用锚节点的原始CIR数据，在复杂工业环境中显著提高了定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UWB定位系统在工业环境中因多径效应和NLOS条件导致精度下降，现有方法通常排除NLOS链接，但会导致几何精度稀释问题，且在NLOS链接占多数时不可行。

Method: 提出了一种基于Transformer的TDoA位置校正方法，采用不同的CIR排序、分块和位置编码策略，并分析其可扩展性和性能提升。

Result: 在真实UWB测量实验中，该方法在几乎全是NLOS信号的复杂环境中实现了0.39米的精度，比TDoA基线提高了73.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了工业环境中NLOS条件下的定位问题，显著提升了定位精度。

Abstract: Despite their high accuracy, UWB-based localization systems suffer
inaccuracies when deployed in industrial locations with many obstacles due to
multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. In such
environments, current error mitigation approaches for time difference of
arrival (TDoA) localization typically exclude NLOS links. However, this
exclusion approach leads to geometric dilution of precision problems and this
approach is infeasible when the majority of links are NLOS. To address these
limitations, we propose a transformer-based TDoA position correction method
that uses raw channel impulse responses (CIRs) from all available anchor nodes
to compute position corrections. We introduce different CIR ordering, patching
and positional encoding strategies for the transformer, and analyze each
proposed technique's scalability and performance gains. Based on experiments on
real-world UWB measurements, our approach can provide accuracies of up to 0.39
m in a complex environment consisting of (almost) only NLOS signals, which is
an improvement of 73.6 % compared to the TDoA baseline.

### [6] [Implicit Neural Representation of Beamforming for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA) System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03609)
*Shiyong Chen,Jia Guo,Shengqian Han*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的方法优化连续孔径阵列（CAPA）系统中的下行波束成形，使用DNN（BeaINR和CoefINR）参数化波束成形函数，显著提升了频谱效率和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CAPA系统中，波束成形是一个复杂的函数映射问题，传统方法难以高效解决，因此需要一种学习型方法来优化性能。

Method: 提出两种DNN：BeaINR参数化波束成形函数，CoefINR学习信道函数的加权系数，降低复杂度。

Result: 仿真结果表明，基于INR的方法在频谱效率和推理时间上优于数值基线，CoefINR进一步提升了训练效率。

Conclusion: 学习型方法在CAPA系统中优化波束成形具有显著优势，尤其是CoefINR在复杂度和效率上的表现更优。

Abstract: In this paper, a learning-based approach for optimizing downlink beamforming
in continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems is proposed, where a MIMO scenario
that both the base station (BS) and the user are equipped with CAPA is
considered. As the beamforming in the CAPA system is a function that maps a
coordinate on the aperture to the beamforming weight at the coordinate, a DNN
called BeaINR is proposed to parameterize this function, which is called
implicit neural representation (INR). We further find that the optimal
beamforming function lies in the subspace of channel function, i.e., it can be
expressed as a weighted integral of channel function. Based on this finding, we
propose another DNN called CoefINR to learn the weighting coefficient with INR,
which has lower complexity than learning the beamforming function with BeaINR.
Simulation results show that the proposed INR-based methods outperform
numerical baselines in both spectral efficiency (SE) and inference time, with
CoefINR offering additional training efficiency.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用多径传播而非抑制的MEAP天线模式测量技术，避免了无回声环境的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统天线模式测量需抑制多径传播，而MEAP技术则利用多径传播，简化测量环境要求。

Method: 通过参考天线测量校准多径信道矩阵，并使用向量球谐函数高效表示天线模式。

Result: 数值计算验证了方法的有效性，实验结果在另一篇论文中描述。

Conclusion: MEAP技术为天线模式测量提供了一种更简便的替代方案。

Abstract: Traditional antenna pattern measurements involve minimizing the impact of
multipath propagation in the measurement environment. In contrast, this work
introduces a measurement approach that uses rather than mitigates multipath
propagation. This is referred to as the Multipath-Enhanced Antenna Pattern
(MEAP) Measurement technique. In this respect the approach has some kinship
with Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. The advantage in the case
of MIMO systems is increased capacity; in the MEAP approach the advantage is
elimination of the need for creating an anechoic environment. The approach uses
measurements with reference antennas to calibrate the multipath channel matrix,
and vector spherical harmonics for efficient pattern representation. After
presenting the mathematical details of the method, numerical calculations
illustrating the approach are presented. Experimental results are described in
a companion paper.

Motivation: 验证在典型家庭车库中使用多路径环境进行天线模式测量的可行性。

Method: 使用半波长电偶极子作为校准和测试天线，采用三种分析方法：矩阵反演法、最小二乘误差法及带功率约束的最小二乘误差法。

Result: 带约束的最小二乘误差技术表现最佳。

Conclusion: 实验证明了该技术在多路径环境中的可行性，且带约束的最小二乘误差法效果最优。

Abstract: In a companion paper we presented the theory for an antenna pattern measuring
technique that uses (rather than mitigates) the properties of a multipath
environment. Here we use measurements in a typical home garage to
experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of the technique. A half-wavelength
electric dipole with different orientations was used as both the calibration
and test antennas. For simplicity, we limited the modeling of the antenna
pattern to using only the three $l=1$ vector spherical harmonics. Three methods
were used to analyze the measurements: a matrix inversion method using only 3
sense antennas, a least-square-error technique, and a least-square-error
technique with a constant power constraint imposed. The two least-square-error
techniques used the measurements from 10 sense antennas. The constrained
least-square-error technique was found to give the best results.

Result: 仿真表明，该框架能修正因信道噪声独立性假设导致的多dB SER误差。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为THz通信系统的SER分析提供了更准确的工具，尤其在相关条件下表现优异。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive symbol error rate (SER) analysis framework for
link-level terahertz (THz)-band communication systems under linear zero-forcing
(ZF) data detection. First, we derive the mismatched SER for indoor THz systems
under independent channel and noise assumptions, calculating the probability
density function of the ratio of Gaussian noise to $\alpha$-$\mu$ channels
resulting from ZF filtering. Next, we derive the precise SER under correlated
channel and noise conditions, modeling dependencies using the copula method.
Finally, we evaluate the SER for THz channels with correlated distortion noise
from hardware impairments. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework
corrects for multi-dB SERs resulting from the channel-noise independence
assumption.

### [10] [Improving SAGIN Resilience to Jamming with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03729)
*Leila Marandi,Khaled Humadi,Gunes Karabulut Kurt,Wessam Ajib,Wei-Ping Zhu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了在抗干扰的空天地一体化网络（SAGIN）中，利用固定无人机（UAV）上的可重构智能表面（RIS）对抗恶意干扰攻击的方案。通过优化RIS波束成形和低轨（LEO）卫星的发射功率，最大化信号与干扰加噪声比（SJNR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未考虑在低轨卫星向地面用户发送信号时，同步受到地球静止轨道（GEO）卫星干扰的场景。本文旨在通过RIS和优化技术提升抗干扰性能。

Method: 假设RIS具备全局信道状态信息（CSI），采用交替优化（AO）和半定松弛（SDR）技术解决复杂度问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明优化方案显著提升了性能，且在干扰功率高、RIS单元数较少时，将RIS部署在靠近用户的无人机上更有效。

Conclusion: 通过优化RIS和发射功率，显著提升了抗干扰能力，尤其在特定场景下，RIS部署位置对性能影响显著。

Abstract: This study investigates the anti-jamming space-air-ground integrated network
(SAGIN) scenario wherein a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed
on a fixed Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to counteract malevolent jamming
attacks. In contrast to existing research, in this paper, we consider that a
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite is sending the signal to the user on the ground
in the presence of jamming from a Geostationary Equatorial Orbit (GEO)
satellite side. We aim to maximize the signal-to-jamming plus noise ratio
(SJNR) by optimizing the RIS beamforming and transmit power of the LEO
satellite. Assuming the availability of global channel state information (CSI)
at the RIS, we propose alternating optimization (AO) and semidefinite
relaxation (SDR) techniques to address the complexity. Simulation results show
that the optimization schemes lead to considerable performance improvements.
The results also indicate that, given the high jamming power and the relatively
small number of RIS elements, deploying the RIS on UAVs near the user is more
effective in mitigating the impact of jamming interferers.

*Rayan Salmi,Guorui Lu,Qinyu Chen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: SHAP-AAD框架通过DeepSHAP选择关键EEG通道，结合轻量级TCN，减少通道数量但保持高检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AAD方法依赖过多电极，影响穿戴舒适性，需减少通道数量。

Method: 两阶段框架：DeepSHAP选择关键通道，轻量级TCN进行高效AAD。

Result: 32通道性能接近64通道（79.21% vs. 81.06%），8通道也能满足需求。

Conclusion: SHAP-AAD在降低复杂度的同时保持高性能，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based auditory attention detection (AAD) offers
a non-invasive way to enhance hearing aids, but conventional methods rely on
too many electrodes, limiting wearability and comfort. This paper presents
SHAP-AAD, a two-stage framework that combines DeepSHAP-based channel selection
with a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) for efficient AAD using
fewer channels.DeepSHAP, an explainable AI technique, is applied to a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on topographic alpha-power maps to
rank channel importance, and the top-k EEG channels are used to train a compact
TCN. Experiments on the DTU dataset show that using 32 channels yields
comparable accuracy to the full 64-channel setup (79.21% vs. 81.06%) on
average. In some cases, even 8 channels can deliver satisfactory accuracy.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SHAP-AAD in reducing complexity
while preserving high detection performance.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于压缩感知的算法，用于识别易受干扰的节点并鲁棒估计其位置，同时设计了最优锚点配置以提高定位任务的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际部署中，无线传感器网络在恶劣环境下（如强干扰、极端天气或剧烈运动）会导致定位误差显著增加，尤其是在水体表面部署时。

Method: 将问题建模为压缩感知问题，提出了节点识别和鲁棒估计的算法，并设计了最优锚点配置。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提算法能以较少的锚点实现目标，且仅需目标到锚点的距离信息。

Conclusion: 该方法具有广泛适用性和鲁棒性，适用于恶劣环境下的定位任务。

Abstract: Many applications have been identified which require the deployment of
large-scale low-power wireless sensor networks. Some of the deployment
environments, however, impose harsh operation conditions due to intense
cross-technology interference, extreme weather conditions (heavy rainfall,
excessive heat, etc.), or rough motion, thereby affecting the quality and
predictability of the wireless links the nodes establish. In localization
tasks, these conditions often lead to significant errors in estimating the
position of target nodes. Motivated by the practical deployments of sensors on
the surface of different water bodies, we address the problem of identifying
susceptible nodes and robustly estimating their positions. We formulate these
tasks as a compressive sensing problem and propose algorithms for both node
identification and robust estimation. Additionally, we design an optimal anchor
configuration to maximize the robustness of the position estimation task. Our
numerical results and comparisons with competitive methods demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms achieve both objectives with a modest number of anchors.
Since our method relies only on target-to-anchor distances, it is broadly
applicable and yields resilient, robust localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检测器（如ZF、LMMSE、MPA）在复杂多径信道下性能不足，需一种更高效且鲁棒的方法。

Method: 使用变分贝叶斯方法，通过最小化KL散度近似后验分布，实现低复杂度软判决检测。

Result: 仿真显示，该方法比特错误率更低、收敛更快，且在复杂多径信道下更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和检测性能上均优于传统方法，适用于AFDM系统。

Abstract: This paper proposes a variational Bayesian (VB) detector for affine frequency
division multiplexing (AFDM) systems. The proposed method estimates the symbol
probability distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
between the true posterior and an approximate distribution, thereby enabling
low-complexity soft-decision detection. Compared to conventional approaches
such as zero-forcing (ZF), Linear minimum mean square rrror (LMMSE), and the
message passing algorithm (MPA), the proposed detector demonstrates lower bit
error rates (BER), faster convergence, and improved robustness under complex
multipath channels. Simulation results confirm its dual advantages in
computational efficiency and detection performance.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文探讨了冷冻电镜和冷冻电子断层扫描中的确认偏差问题，指出模板匹配和深度神经网络方法可能在纯噪声中产生虚假结构，并提出缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决冷冻电镜和冷冻电子断层扫描中因先验期望导致的数据解释系统误差问题。

Method: 结合理论分析和控制实验，研究模板匹配和深度神经网络在纯噪声中产生虚假结构的现象。

Result: 发现两种方法在纯噪声中均能产生持久分子结构，揭示了当前工作流程的潜在偏差。

Conclusion: 呼吁谨慎解释重建结果，并提出减少偏差的实用策略。

Abstract: Confirmation bias is a fundamental challenge in cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), where prior expectations can
lead to systematic errors in data interpretation. This bias may emerge at
multiple stages of the reconstruction pipeline, and in particular in the
critical particle picking stage, where 2D particles (in cryo-EM) or 3D
subtomograms (in cryo-ET) are extracted from highly noisy micrographs or
tomograms. Focusing on two widely used methodologies, template matching and
deep neural networks, we combine theoretical analysis with controlled
experiments to demonstrate that both methods, when applied to pure noise, can
produce persistent molecular structures, a phenomenon we term structure from
noise. This artifact highlights a critical vulnerability in current workflows:
the potential for particle-picking algorithms to inject strong prior-driven
bias into downstream analyses. We then propose practical mitigation strategies
to reduce the impact of such biases. Together, our findings deepen the
theoretical understanding of confirmation bias in cryo-EM and cryo-ET and call
for cautious interpretation of reconstructions, primarily when relying on
template-driven particle picking.

Motivation: 未来高度自动化驾驶对雷达感知系统的错误率要求更高，传统严格滤波方法无法满足需求。

Result: 实验证明，该方法召回率高，且将非聚类关键点的比率降低了74.8%。

Conclusion: 动态滤波方法在保证高召回率的同时，显著降低了误检率，适用于高要求自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: Radar sensors play a crucial role for perception systems in automated driving
but suffer from a high level of noise. In the past, this could be solved by
strict filters, which remove most false positives at the expense of undetected
objects. Future highly automated functions are much more demanding with respect
to error rate. Hence, if the radar sensor serves as a component of perception
systems for such functions, a simple filter strategy cannot be applied. In this
paper, we present a modified filtering approach which is characterized by the
idea to vary the filtering depending on the potential of harmful collision with
the object which is potentially represented by the radar point. We propose an
algorithm which determines a criticality score for each point based on the
planned or presumable trajectory of the automated vehicle. Points identified as
very critical can trigger manifold actions to confirm or deny object presence.
Our pipeline introduces criticality regions. The filter threshold in these
criticality regions is omitted. Commonly known radar data sets do not or barely
feature critical scenes. Thus, we present an approach to evaluate our framework
by adapting the planned trajectory towards vulnerable road users, which serve
as ground truth critical points. Evaluation of the criticality metric prove
high recall rates. Besides, our post-processing algorithm lowers the rate of
non-clustered critical points by 74.8 % in an exemplary setup compared to a
moderate, generic filter.

TL;DR: MMOC是一个自监督多模型在线协作框架，用于解决EEG情绪识别中的跨被试数据漂移问题，通过动态激活最适合的模型实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG情绪识别中，监督学习依赖人工标注成本高且易偏，自监督学习虽能减少标注依赖，但跨被试数据漂移限制了模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出MMOC框架，结合重建和对比学习的多模型训练策略，通过损失路由机制动态选择最优模型进行在线适应。

Result: 在SEED和Dreamer数据集上表现优异，分别达到85.39%、68.77%和69.37%的准确率。

Conclusion: MMOC有效缓解跨被试数据漂移，为实际EEG情绪识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) emotion recognition plays a crucial role in
human-computer interaction, particularly in healthcare and neuroscience. While
supervised learning has been widely used, its reliance on manual annotations
introduces high costs and potential bias. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers
a promising alternative by generating labels through pretext tasks. However,
high inter-subject variability in EEG signals leads to significant data drift,
limiting self-supervised models' generalization across unseen subjects.
Traditional domain adaptation (DA) methods require access to target-domain data
during training. Although domain generalization (DG) avoids this constraint, it
often falls short in handling complex data drift due to limited coverage of
possible target distributions. To tackle these challenges, we propose MMOC, a
self-supervised framework with multi-model online collaboration (MMOC), to
achieve online adaptation to unseen data. MMOC trains multiple base models
using diverse strategies rooted in reconstruction and contrastive learning,
enabling each model to develop distinct generalization capabilities. During
inference, MMOC dynamically activates the most suitable model for each test
sample via a loss-based routing mechanism that evaluates both contrastive and
reconstruction losses. This dual consideration allows for a comprehensive
measurement of data drift at both structural and semantic levels. Experimental
results on the SEED and Dreamer datasets show that MMOC achieves
state-of-the-art performance: 85.39% on SEED, and 68.77% and 69.37% on Dreamer
arousal and valence dimensions, respectively. MMOC effectively mitigates
inter-subject data drift, offering a practical solution for real-world EEG
emotion recognition.

Abstract: Fault detection is crucial to ensure the reliability of navigation systems.
However, mainstream fault detection methods are developed based on Gaussian
assumptions on nominal errors, while current attempts at non-Gaussian fault
detection are either heuristic or lack rigorous statistical properties. The
performance and reliability of these methods are challenged in real-world
applications. This paper proposes the jackknife detector, a fault detection
method tailored for linearized pseudorange-based positioning systems under
non-Gaussian nominal errors. Specifically, by leveraging the jackknife
technique, a test statistic is derived as a linear combination of measurement
errors, eliminating the need for restrictive distributional assumptions while
maintaining computational efficiency. A hypothesis test with the Bonferroni
correction is then constructed to detect potential faults in measurements.
Theoretical analysis proves the equivalence between the jackknife detector and
the solution separation (SS) detector, while revealing the former's superior
computational efficiency. Through a worldwide simulation and a real-world
satellite clock anomaly detection experiment--both involving non-Gaussian
nominal errors--the proposed jackknife detector demonstrates equivalent
detection performance to the SS detector but achieves a fourfold improvement in
computational efficiency. These results highlight the jackknife detector's
substantial potential for real-time applications requiring robust and efficient
fault detection in non-Gaussian noise environments.

Abstract: Ray tracing is a widely used deterministic method for radio propagation
simulations, capable of producing physically accurate multipath components. The
accuracy depends on the quality of the environment model and its
electromagnetic properties. Recent advances in computer vision and machine
learning have made it possible to reconstruct detailed environment models
augmented with semantic segmentation labels.
  In this letter, we propose a differentiable ray tracing-based radio
propagation simulator that operates directly on point clouds. We showcase the
efficiency of our method by simulating multi-bounce propagation paths with up
to five interactions with specular reflections and diffuse scattering in two
indoor scenarios, each completing in less than 90 ms. Lastly, we demonstrate
how the differentiability of electromagnetic computations can be combined with
segmentation labels to learn the electromagnetic properties of the environment.

Abstract: Atomic receivers based on Rydberg vapor cells as sensors of electromagnetic
fields offer a promising alternative to conventional radio frequency
front-ends. In multi-antenna configurations, the magnitude-only,
phase-insensitive measurements produced by atomic receivers pose challenges for
traditional detection methods. Existing solutions rely on two-step iterative
optimization processes, which suffer from cascaded channel estimation errors
and high computational complexity. We propose a channel state information
(CSI)-free symbol detection method based on in-context learning (ICL), which
directly maps pilot-response pairs to data symbol predictions without explicit
channel estimation. Simulation results show that ICL achieves competitive
accuracy with {higher computational efficiency} compared to existing solutions.

crucial for various applications such as wireless communication and navigation.
They are often installed on platforms with challenging mechanical and stealth
constraints like vehicles, drones, and helmets, where traditional methods --
mechanically rotating antennas or conformal arrays -- tend to be bulky, heavy,
and costly. A recent work has proposed a conformal frequency diverse antenna
that is designed to produce angularly diverse patterns that encode angular
information into frequency sweeps. This capability allows AoA to be determined
across the entire horizon using only two receiving units. This paper
experimentally validates this concept, detailing the prototyping process and
practical design considerations. The AoA detection capabilities of the proposed
device are confirmed through experimental demonstrations. The proposed
conformal metasurfaces offer an alternative hardware solution for sensing over
large fields of view, with potential applications in radar sensing, situational

Abstract: In this paper, scanning for target detection, and multi-target tracking in a
cognitive radar system are considered, and adaptive radar resource management
is investigated. In particular, time management for radar scanning and tracking
of multiple maneuvering targets subject to budget constraints is studied with
the goal to jointly maximize the tracking and scanning performances of a
cognitive radar. We tackle the constrained optimization problem of allocating
the dwell time to track individual targets by employing a deep deterministic
policy gradient (DDPG) based reinforcement learning approach. We propose a
constrained deep reinforcement learning (CDRL) algorithm that updates the DDPG
neural networks and dual variables simultaneously. Numerical results show that
the radar can autonomously allocate time appropriately so as to maximize the
reward function without exceeding the time constraint.

Motivation: 传统RAIM和ARAIM依赖高斯模型，对实际非高斯误差（如重尾误差）过于保守，需改进以提升精度和完整性。

Method: 提出扩展jackknife检测器和jackknife ARAIM算法，通过量化故障向量对位置解的影响，推导完整性风险的紧边界。

Result: 在全球模拟中，单GPS星座下VPL降低至45m，双星座（GPS-Galileo）下VPL保持在40m以下，92%操作满足35m垂直警报限制。

Conclusion: jackknife ARAIM显著提升GNSS应用的完整性和可用性，支持200英尺高度的LPV导航。

Abstract: Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are essential for aviation,
requiring strict integrity monitoring to alert users to hazardously misleading
information. Conventional receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) and
advanced RAIM (ARAIM) rely heavily on Gaussian models in bounding nominal
errors, which can be overly conservative with real-world non-Gaussian errors
with heavy tails, such as the satellite clock and orbit errors. This paper
proposes an extended jackknife detector capable of detecting multiple
simultaneous faults with non-Gaussian nominal errors. Furthermore, an integrity
monitoring algorithm, jackknife ARAIM, is developed by systematically
exploiting the properties of the jackknife detector in the range domain. A
tight bound of the integrity risk is derived by quantifying the impacts of
hypothetical fault vectors on the position solution. The proposed method is
examined in worldwide simulations, with the nominal measurement error simulated
based on authentic experimental data, which reveals different findings in
existing research. In a setting of a single Global Positioning System (GPS)
constellation, the proposed method reduces the 99.5 percentile vertical
protection level (VPL) 45m, where the VPL of the baseline ARAIM is larger than
50m in most user locations. For dual-constellation (GPS-Galileo) settings,
baseline ARAIM suffers VPL inflation over 60m due to the over-conservatism
induced by the heavy-tailed Galileo signal-in-space range errors, whereas the
proposed jackknife ARAIM retains VPL below 40m, achieving over 92% normal
operations for a 35m Vertical Alert Limit. These improvements have promising
potential to support localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV) with a
decision height of 200 ft, enhancing integrity and availability for
multi-constellation GNSS applications.

Motivation: 6G网络需要同时支持高速通信和高精度感知，但现有技术多基于远场假设，难以适应太赫兹近场传播特性。因此，研究近场ISAC技术具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 近场ISAC是一个新兴领域，本文系统探讨了其特性和应用，并指出了未来研究方向，为6G网络的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks are expected not only to provide
high-speed connectivity but also to support reliable sensing capabilities,
giving rise to the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm. To
enable higher data rates and more accurate sensing, terahertz (THz) systems
empowered by extremely large multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO)
technology are envisioned as key enablers for future ISAC systems. Owing to the
substantial increase in both effective array aperture and carrier frequency, a
considerable portion of future ISAC applications is anticipated to fall within
the near-field coverage region, instead of the conventional far-field. However,
most existing ISAC techniques are designed under the far-field planar wave
assumption, struggling to accommodate the unique characteristics of THz
near-field propagation. To motivate future research into near-field ISAC
research, we systematically investigate the characteristics of THz near-field
propagation and explore its potential to facilitate ISAC systems. Specifically,
we analyze three fundamental characteristics of THz near-field propagation and
review state-of-the-art techniques that exploit these features to boost both
communication and sensing performance. To further harness the angular-range
coupling effect, we zoom into a particularly interesting approach to near-field
sensing based on wavenumber domain. Besides, to exploit the beam squint effect,
an ISAC resource allocation framework is introduced to support integrated
multi-angle sensing and multi-user communication. Finally, we outline promising
directions for future research in this emerging area.

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer remarkable spatial flexibility but face
significant challenges in acquiring high-resolution channel state information

CANet, a robust deep learning model for channel extrapolation in FAS. CANet
combines context-adaptive modeling with a cross-scale attention mechanism and
is built on a ConvNeXt v2 backbone to improve extrapolation accuracy for
unobserved antenna ports. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a novel
spatial amplitude perturbation strategy, inspired by frequency-domain
augmentation techniques in image processing. This motivates the incorporation
of a Fourier-domain loss function, capturing frequency-domain consistency,
alongside a spectral structure consistency loss that reinforces learning
stability under perturbations. Our simulation results demonstrate that CANet
outperforms benchmark models across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
levels.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of the Metaverse, enhanced by blockchain
technology, the efficient processing of data has emerged as a critical
challenge, especially in wireless communication systems. Addressing this
challenge, our paper introduces the innovative concept of data processing
efficiency (DPE), aiming to maximize processed bits per unit of resource
consumption in blockchain-empowered Metaverse environments. To achieve this, we
propose the DPE-Aware User Association and Resource Allocation (DAUR)
algorithm, a tailored optimization framework for blockchain-enabled Metaverse
wireless communication systems characterized by joint computing and
communication resource constraints. The DAUR algorithm transforms the nonconvex
problem of maximizing the sum of DPE ratios into a solvable convex optimization
problem. It alternates the optimization of key variables, including user
association, work offloading ratios, task-specific computing resource
distribution, bandwidth allocation, user power usage ratios, and server
computing resource allocation ratios. Our extensive numerical results
demonstrate the DAUR algorithm's effectiveness in DPE.

Conclusion: 提出的方法克服了传统SLAM技术的限制，为毫米波5G NR系统的环境感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) 5G New Radio (NR) communication systems, with their
high-resolution antenna arrays and extensive bandwidth, offer a transformative
opportunity for high-throughput data transmission and advanced environmental
sensing. Although passive sensing-based SLAM techniques can estimate user
locations and environmental reflections simultaneously, their effectiveness is
often constrained by assumptions of specular reflections and oversimplified map
representations. To overcome these limitations, this work employs a mmWave 5G
NR system for active sensing, enabling it to function similarly to a laser
scanner for point cloud generation. Specifically, point clouds are extracted
from the power delay profile estimated from each beam direction using a binary
search approach. To ensure accuracy, hardware delays are calibrated with
multiple predefined target points. Pose variations of the terminal are then
estimated from point cloud data gathered along continuous trajectory viewpoints
using point cloud registration algorithms. Loop closure detection and pose
graph optimization are subsequently applied to refine the sensing results,
achieving precise terminal localization and detailed radio map reconstruction.
The system is implemented and validated through both simulations and
experiments, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Over the air computation (AirComp) is a promising technique that addresses
big data collection and fast wireless data aggregation. However, in a network
where wireless communication and AirComp coexist, mutual interference becomes a
critical challenge. In this paper, we propose to employ an unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) to enable integrated communication and AirComp, where we
capitalize on UAV mobility with alleviated interference for performance
enhancement. Particularly, we aim to maximize the sum of user transmission rate
with the guaranteed AirComp accuracy requirement, where we jointly optimize the
transmission strategy, signal normalizing factor, scheduling strategy, and UAV
trajectory. We decouple the formulated problem into two layers where the outer
layer is for UAV trajectory and scheduling, and the inner layer is for
transmission and computation. Then, we solve the inner layer problem through
alternating optimization, and the outer layer is solved through soft actor
critic based deep reinforcement learning. Simulation results show the
convergence of the proposed learning process and also demonstrate the
performance superiority of our proposal as compared with the baselines in
various situations.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of uplink fronthaul compression
techniques within Open RAN (O-RAN) to mitigate fronthaul load in decentralized
distributed MIMO (DD-MIMO) systems. With the ever-increasing demand for high
data rates and system scalability, the fronthaul load becomes a critical
bottleneck. Our method uses O-RAN compression techniques to efficiently
compress the fronthaul signals. The goal is to greatly lower the fronthaul load
while having little effect on the overall system performance, as shown by Block
Error Rate (BLER) curves. Through rigorous link-level simulations, we compare
our quantization strategies against a benchmark scenario with no quantization,
providing insights into the trade-offs between fronthaul data rate reduction
and link performance integrity. The results demonstrate that our proposed
quantization techniques not only lower the fronthaul load but also maintain a
competitive link quality, making them a viable solution for enhancing the
efficiency of next-generation wireless networks. This study underscores the
potential of quantization in O-RAN contexts to achieve optimal balance between
system capacity and performance, paving the way for more scalable and robust
DD-MIMO deployments.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being integrated into
next-generation networks to enhance communication coverage and network
capacity. However, the dynamic and mobile nature of UAVs poses significant
security challenges, including jamming, eavesdropping, and cyber-attacks. To
address these security challenges, this paper proposes a federated
learning-based lightweight network with zero trust for enhancing the security
of UAV networks. A novel lightweight spectrogram network is proposed for UAV
authentication and rejection, which can effectively authenticate and reject
UAVs based on spectrograms. Experiments highlight LSNet's superior performance
in identifying both known and unknown UAV classes, demonstrating significant
improvements over existing benchmarks in terms of accuracy, model compactness,
and storage requirements. Notably, LSNet achieves an accuracy of over $80\%$
for known UAV types and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic
(AUROC) of $0.7$ for unknown types when trained with all five clients. Further

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电表中能源盗窃检测的高计算和能耗成本限制了实用性，尤其在低盗窃场景中。

Method: 设计了一种轻量级检测单元（看门狗机制），仅在可能涉及能源盗窃时激活LSTM模型。

Result: 在六种不同盗窃严重性和活跃盗贼数量的场景中，能耗降低超过64%，检测准确性损失极小且召回率高。

Conclusion: 该研究为智能电网中部署可持续、高效的AI辅助监控系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of smart meters in electrical grids
worldwide, detecting energy theft has become a critical and ongoing challenge.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have demonstrated strong performance
in identifying fraudulent consumption patterns; however, previous works
exploring the use of machine learning solutions for this problem demand high
computational and energy costs, limiting their practicality -- particularly in
low-theft scenarios where continuous inference can result in unnecessary energy
usage. This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism,
designed to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed
to the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve
energy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing
energy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed
system was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying
theft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power
consumption reduction exceeding 64\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy
and consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more
energy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart
grids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve
marginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment
considerations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results
highlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring
systems within modern smart grid infrastructures.

Method: 利用物联网传感器实时监控机器状态，结合机器学习算法预测故障，实现及时维护。

Result: 模拟测试显示，系统显著提高了早期故障检测能力，减少了不必要的维护干预。

Conclusion: 预测性维护系统可显著提升自动售货机的运行效率和服务可靠性。

Abstract: The increasing proliferation of vending machines in public and commercial
environments has placed a growing emphasis on operational efficiency and
customer satisfaction. Traditional maintenance approaches either reactive or
time-based preventive are limited in their ability to preempt machine failures,
leading to unplanned downtimes and elevated service costs. This research
presents a novel predictive maintenance framework tailored for vending machines
by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning (ML)
algorithms. The proposed system continuously monitors machine components and
operating conditions in real time and applies predictive models to forecast
failures before they occur. This enables timely maintenance scheduling,
minimizing downtime and extending machine lifespan. The framework was validated
through simulated fault data and performance evaluation using classification
algorithms. Results show a significant improvement in early fault detection and
a reduction in redundant service interventions. The findings indicate that
predictive maintenance systems, when integrated into vending infrastructure,
can transform operational efficiency and service reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过将自适应滤波器权重约束在低维流形上，改进FxLMS算法，提升主动噪声控制性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用噪声或控制源的空间区域先验知识，优化FxLMS算法的收敛速度和稳态误差。

Method: 训练自编码器对稳态滤波器系数建模，约束自适应滤波器权重为解码器输出，并在潜在空间更新权重。

Result: 在某些条件下，Latent FxLMS模型收敛更快，稳态误差与标准FxLMS相当。

Conclusion: Latent FxLMS通过低维流形约束，有效提升了主动噪声控制的性能。

Abstract: Filtered-X LMS (FxLMS) is commonly used for active noise control (ANC),
wherein the soundfield is minimized at a desired location. Given prior
knowledge of the spatial region of the noise or control sources, we could
improve FxLMS by adapting along the low-dimensional manifold of possible
adaptive filter weights. We train an auto-encoder on the filter coefficients of
the steady-state adaptive filter for each primary source location sampled from
a given spatial region and constrain the weights of the adaptive filter to be
the output of the decoder for a given state of latent variables. Then, we
perform updates in the latent space and use the decoder to generate the
cancellation filter. We evaluate how various neural network constraints and
normalization techniques impact the convergence speed and steady-state mean
squared error. Under certain conditions, our Latent FxLMS model converges in
fewer steps with comparable steady-state error to the standard FxLMS.

Result: 在空间和非空间预测任务中表现优异，如蛋白质填补和基因到蛋白质预测，并能泛化到未见过的条件配置。

Conclusion: 该框架为高维多通道空间生物数据的生成提供了高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial profiling technologies in biology, such as imaging mass cytometry
(IMC) and spatial transcriptomics (ST), generate high-dimensional,
multi-channel data with strong spatial alignment and complex inter-channel
relationships. Generative modeling of such data requires jointly capturing
intra- and inter-channel structure, while also generalizing across arbitrary
combinations of observed and missing channels for practical application.
Existing diffusion-based models generally assume low-dimensional inputs (e.g.,
RGB images) and rely on simple conditioning mechanisms that break spatial
correspondence and ignore inter-channel dependencies. This work proposes a
unified diffusion framework for controllable generation over structured and
spatial biological data. Our model contains two key innovations: (1) a
hierarchical feature injection mechanism that enables multi-resolution
conditioning on spatially aligned channels, and (2) a combination of
latent-space and output-space channel-wise attention to capture inter-channel
relationships. To support flexible conditioning and generalization to arbitrary
subsets of observed channels, we train the model using a random masking
strategy, enabling it to reconstruct missing channels from any combination of
inputs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across both spatial and
non-spatial prediction tasks, including protein imputation in IMC and
gene-to-protein prediction in single-cell datasets, and show strong
generalization to unseen conditional configurations.

Abstract: This study evaluates the use of Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined
with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to differentiate Hanwoo beef
(HNB) and Holstein beef (HLB) to address food authenticity, mislabeling, and
adulteration. Rapid and non-invasive spectral data were attained by a portable
NIRS, recording absorbance data within the wavelength range of 700 to 1100 nm.
A total of 40 Longissimus lumborum samples, evenly split between HNB and HLB,
were obtained from a local hypermarket. Data analysis using Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) demonstrated distinct spectral patterns associated with chemical
changes, clearly separating the two beef varieties and accounting for 93.72% of
the total variance. ML models, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, Gradient
Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and
Neural Networks (NN), were implemented, optimized through hyperparameter
tuning, and validated by 5-fold cross-validation techniques to enhance model
robustness and prevent overfitting. Random Forest provided the highest
predictive accuracy with a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 0.8826, closely followed by the SVM model at 0.8747.
Furthermore, GB and NN algorithms exhibited satisfactory performances, with
cross-validation scores of 0.752. Notably, the NN model achieved the highest
recall rate of 0.7804, highlighting its suitability in scenarios requiring
heightened sensitivity. DT and NB exhibited comparatively lower predictive
performance. The LR and SVM models emerged as optimal choices by effectively
balancing high accuracy, precision, and recall. This study confirms that
integrating NIRS with ML techniques offers a powerful and reliable method for
meat authenticity, significantly contributing to detecting food fraud.

Conclusion: 该方法为传感器有限的现实环境提供了可行的控制策略实现方案。

Abstract: Feedback control of fluid-based systems poses significant challenges due to
their high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale dynamics, which demand
real-time, three-dimensional, multi-component measurements for sensing. While
such measurements are feasible in digital simulations, they are often only
partially accessible in the real world. In this paper, we propose a method to
adapt feedback control policies obtained from full-state measurements to setups
with only partial measurements. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated
environment by minimising the aerodynamic drag of a simplified road vehicle.
Reinforcement learning algorithms can optimally solve this control task when
trained on full-state measurements by placing sensors in the wake. However, in
real-world applications, sensors are limited and typically only on the vehicle,
providing only partial measurements. To address this, we propose to train a
Domain Specific Feature Transfer (DSFT) map reconstructing the full
measurements from the history of the partial measurements. By applying this
map, we derive optimal policies based solely on partial data. Additionally, our
method enables determination of the optimal history length and offers insights
into the architecture of optimal control policies, facilitating their
implementation in real-world environments with limited sensor information.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
domains, but their effectiveness in time series forecasting remains
understudied. This work empirically examines whether pre-trained large-scale
time series models (LSTSMs) trained on diverse datasets can outperform
traditional non-pretrained small-scale transformers in forecasting tasks. We
analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained universal time series models (e.g.,
Moirai, TimeGPT) alongside conventional transformers, evaluating accuracy,
computational efficiency, and interpretability across multiple benchmarks. Our
findings reveal the strengths and limitations of pre-trained LSTSMs, providing
insights into their suitability for time series tasks compared to task-specific
small-scale architectures. The results highlight scenarios where pretraining
offers advantages and where simpler models remain competitive.

Motivation: 现有研究在欧几里得空间中融合多模态神经影像数据，难以有效捕捉脑网络的内在层次结构。

Method: HKGF包括多模态图构建模块、双曲空间图表示学习模块、跨模态耦合模块和下游预测的双曲神经网络。

Result: 在超过4,000名受试者的实验中，HKGF在神经认知衰退预测任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HKGF是一种通用的多模态数据分析框架，有助于客观量化与神经认知衰退相关的脑结构/功能连接变化。

Abstract: Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain
activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain
regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps
detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are
generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture
intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks.
This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for
neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a
multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module
that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic
kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that
enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for
downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to
capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving
the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving
over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF
over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks.
HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating
objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes
associated with neurocognitive decline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSOP是一种数据驱动的方法，通过直接剪枝操作而非token来消除冗余计算，提升VLM效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM token剪枝方法在剪枝时可能同时移除关键操作，而保留的token可能包含冗余操作。

Method: GSOP将VLM解码器计算分解为三个维度的原子操作，通过贪心排序确定剪枝顺序，适应不同计算预算。

Result: GSOP减少70%计算量，仅损失4%性能，并在跨VLM和任务中保持18%性能优势。

Conclusion: GSOP在效率和性能间取得平衡，实际GPU评估验证其价值。

Abstract: Prior Vision Language Model (VLM) token pruning reduces computation by
eliminating attention and feed-forward operations for pruned tokens while
maintaining all operations for critical tokens. However, this binary approach
conflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along
with discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant
operations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving
critical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a
data-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP
first decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along
three dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP
determines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP
iteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance
drop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets
can be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according
to this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency
through: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant
evaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune" and ``danger-to-prune"
operations from sorting. GSOP achieves compelling efficiency-performance
tradeoffs, reducing computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss while
maintaining up to 18% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when
transferred across diverse VLMs and tasks. Real GPU efficiency evaluations
confirm its practical value. The code is in

Motivation: 课程强化学习中，设计有效的任务序列是关键，但现有方法依赖真实因果结构，不切实际。

Method: CP-DRL通过交互数据近似任务间因果模型差异，结合奖励增益形成统一目标。

Result: 在Point Mass和Bipedal Walker-Trivial等基准测试中，CP-DRL表现优于现有方法，收敛更快且方差更低。

Conclusion: 利用任务间因果关系可提升课程强化学习的结构感知和样本效率。

Abstract: Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement
learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on
intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote
exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent
approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs),
the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic
assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM
differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal
captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured
by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms
existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster
convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with
comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves
the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results
indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the
structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning.
We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of
our main results at https://github.com/Cho-Geonwoo/CP-DRL.

Abstract: We introduce DiceHuBERT, a knowledge distillation framework for compressing
HuBERT, a widely used self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech foundation
model. Unlike existing distillation methods that rely on layer-wise and
feature-wise mapping between teacher and student models, DiceHuBERT leverages
HuBERT's iterative self-distillation mechanism by directly replacing the
original model with a student model. This replacement allows the student to be
trained using the same SSL objective used when pre-training HuBERT, eliminating
the need for additional modules or architectural constraints. Experimental
results on SUPERB show that DiceHuBERT consistently outperforms existing
distillation methods, improving phoneme recognition performance by over 21% and
ASR performance by more than 14%. Furthermore, DiceHuBERT demonstrates
competitive performance across multiple tasks, highlighting its clear
advantage.

Motivation: 针对碳排放等多因素问题的结构复杂性和多重共线性，提出一种能够客观聚类特征并控制高维复杂性的分析方法。

Method: 使用DBSCAN进行无监督学习聚类特征，结合Elastic Net回归进行高维特征选择和复杂度控制，利用其L1和L2惩罚平衡特性。

Result: 应用于中国46个行业2000-2019年的能源消费数据，识别出16个类别，并定量评估了每类的排放特征和驱动因素。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于分析复杂区域问题（如碳排放），并指出人类认为有意义的定性特征可能对模型不准确。

Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering
with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems
characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by
carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to
objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for
high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is
specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and
regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it
particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this
framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019)
resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and
drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the
framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide
actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the
framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions,
and highlights qualitative features that humans find meaningful may not be
accurate for the model.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical
applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations.
Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron
is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for
safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities
of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain
compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with
model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN
analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness
errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both
qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a
native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for
qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative
reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking
pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring
trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a
BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified
solving approach achieves a $9\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and
PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\times$
speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our
pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\%$ and $86\%$ of the
qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is
in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only
$62\%$ and $4\%$ of the queries, respectively.

TL;DR: Echo State Transformers (EST) 是一种结合 Transformer 注意力机制和 Reservoir Computing 的混合架构，解决了标准 Transformer 的二次复杂度问题，并在低数据场景下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型及其 Transformer 架构虽然高效，但与大脑处理认知任务的方式不符，且序列数据处理存在二次复杂度问题。因此，研究目标是开发更高效、计算需求更低的模型。

Method: EST 结合 Transformer 的注意力机制和 Reservoir Computing，引入并行工作的随机循环网络（Working Memory 模块），动态调整存储和非线性权衡，实现固定计算复杂度。

Result: 在 STREAM 基准测试的 12 项任务中，EST 在 8 项任务上优于 GRU、LSTM 和标准 Transformer。

Conclusion: EST 是 GRU 和 LSTM 的有效替代方案，在资源受限和低数据场景下可作为标准 Transformer 的补充。

Abstract: While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are
remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a
diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore,
sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:
quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these
limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less
reliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce
Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves
this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.
EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from
Reservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.
Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of
the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module
called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent
networks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory
units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical
reservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the
EST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By
maintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST
achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively
breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on
the STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,
demonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of
these tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an
effective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard
Transformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data
scenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在推理地理空间时缺乏灵活性，无法处理多粒度、上下文丰富的区域。

Method: 使用Foursquare和OpenStreetMap数据构建全国POI图，通过无训练图压缩方法生成通用地点嵌入。

Result: 生成的嵌入可无缝集成到地理定位数据管道中，支持多种下游任务。

Conclusion: PlaceFM提供了一种可扩展且适应性强的解决方案，适用于多尺度地理空间分析。

Abstract: Spatial structure is central to effective geospatial intelligence systems.
While foundation models have shown promise, they often lack the flexibility to
reason about places, which are context-rich regions spanning different spatial
granularities. We propose PlaceFM, a spatial foundation model that captures
place representations using a training-free graph condensation method. PlaceFM
condenses a nationwide POI graph built from integrated Foursquare and
OpenStreetMap data in the U.S., generating general-purpose embeddings of
places. These embeddings can be seamlessly integrated into geolocation data
pipelines to support a wide range of downstream tasks. Without requiring
pretraining, PlaceFM offers a scalable and adaptable solution for multi-scale
geospatial analysis.

Conclusion: CMML通过整合领域知识，有效改善了机器学习的成果。

Abstract: Machine learning enables the extraction of useful information from large,
diverse datasets. However, despite many successful applications, machine
learning continues to suffer from performance and transparency issues. These
challenges can be partially attributed to the limited use of domain knowledge
by machine learning models. This research proposes using the domain knowledge
represented in conceptual models to improve the preparation of the data used to
train machine learning models. We develop and demonstrate a method, called the
Conceptual Modeling for Machine Learning (CMML), which is comprised of
guidelines for data preparation in machine learning and based on conceptual
modeling constructs and principles. To assess the impact of CMML on machine
learning outcomes, we first applied it to two real-world problems to evaluate
its impact on model performance. We then solicited an assessment by data
scientists on the applicability of the method. These results demonstrate the
value of CMML for improving machine learning outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期药物发现流程复杂且耗时，需要自动化工具提高效率。LLM结合领域专用工具可解决这一问题。

Method: 框架结合LLM推理与领域工具，执行数据检索、问答、分子生成、性质预测、分子优化及3D结构生成。

Result: 在针对BCL-2的案例中，框架成功生成多样化分子并优化性质，QED>0.6的分子从34增至55，通过药物相似性规则的分子从29增至52。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助药物发现提供了可扩展的基础，支持分子筛选、优先级排序和结构评估。

Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that
automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug
discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the
framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question
answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular
refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study
targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved
relevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES
representations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with
improved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically
diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided
iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of
molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least
four out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a
pool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D
protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for
candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively
supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its
modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models,
providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子预训练模型虽提高了预测准确性，但缺乏化学家的隐性推理能力，MolProphecy旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用ChatGPT模拟化学家推理，生成知识表示，并通过门控交叉注意力机制与分子图特征融合。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优于现有模型，如FreeSolv的RMSE降低15.0%，BACE的AUROC提升5.39%。

Conclusion: MolProphecy提供了一种灵活且通用的方法，支持药物发现中的协作，无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: MolProphecy is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) multi-modal framework designed to
integrate chemists' domain knowledge into molecular property prediction models.
While molecular pre-trained models have enabled significant gains in predictive
accuracy, they often fail to capture the tacit, interpretive reasoning central
to expert-driven molecular design. To address this, MolProphecy employs ChatGPT
as a virtual chemist to simulate expert-level reasoning and decision-making.
The generated chemist knowledge is embedded by the large language model (LLM)
as a dedicated knowledge representation and then fused with graph-based
molecular features through a gated cross-attention mechanism, enabling joint
reasoning over human-derived and structural features. Evaluated on four
benchmark datasets (FreeSolv, BACE, SIDER, and ClinTox), MolProphecy
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a 15.0 percent reduction
in RMSE on FreeSolv and a 5.39 percent improvement in AUROC on BACE. Analysis
reveals that chemist knowledge and structural features provide complementary
contributions, improving both accuracy and interpretability. MolProphecy offers
a practical and generalizable approach for collaborative drug discovery, with
the flexibility to incorporate real chemist input in place of the current
simulated proxy--without the need for model retraining. The implementation is
publicly available at https://github.com/zhangruochi/MolProphecy.

Result: 该方法能够有效回答从简单图到蛋白质和超图等多种图结构的问题，且无需调整架构。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著简化了现有解决方案，并展示了广泛的适用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed
capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as
graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision
while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer
questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some
description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For
a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play
together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions
well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization
to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free
graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from
mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The
simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small
adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range
of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned
prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The
modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from
simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if
any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies
existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based
structures effortlessly.

Motivation: 解决时空预测任务中复杂模型训练效率低、内存消耗高的问题。

Method: 采用频率对齐的知识蒸馏策略，从教师模型的潜在空间中提取多尺度频谱特征，指导学生模型捕捉局部细节和全局模式。

Result: 在Navier-Stokes方程数据集上，MSE和MAE分别降低了81.3%和52.3%。

Conclusion: SDKD框架能有效捕捉高频变化和长期趋势，同时降低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics,
and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low
training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a
lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),
which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex
teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher
model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its
latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency
trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).
However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in
slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a
frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale
spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low
frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both
local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental
results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions
of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.
The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term
trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at

Method: 将多头注意力重新定义为协同计算图系统，每个头作为有共同汇聚状态的DAG，分析混合时间和最小最大保真度。

Result: 多头注意力在特定多样性条件下能协同增强信息传播，提升混合时间和最小最大保真度。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证多头注意力在序列操作任务中的优势，支持理论分析。

Abstract: Multi-head attention powers Transformer networks, the primary deep learning
architecture behind the success of large language models (LLMs). Yet, the
theoretical advantages of multi-head versus single-head attention, beyond mere
parallel processing, remain underexplored. In this paper, we reframe multi-head
attention as a system of potentially synergistic computational graphs, where
each head functions as a feedforward directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a common
sink state. We provide intuition and preliminary theoretical analysis of mixing
time and minimax fidelity in this framework. Our results show that multi-head
attention can synergistically enhance information propagation, yielding faster
mixing times and minimax fidelity amplification under specific head-diversity
conditions. Finally, we train single-head and multi-head Transformers, each
with the same total number of parameters, on sequence manipulation tasks and
empirically verify the predicted effects.

Result: 在罕见肺病案例中，模型在分类、子表型识别和疾病进展预测上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展罕见病患者的识别和分层，适用于临床和研究。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet
individual conditions often remain poorly characterized and difficult to
diagnose due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. While
computational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease
detection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and
biases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and
expert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and
the cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health
records (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial
noise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,
transformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels
with a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from
EHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and
generalizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the
scope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning
embeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence
patterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level
representations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare
pulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from
Boston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in
phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes
through patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to
baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach to
enable scalable identification and stratification of rare disease patients for
clinical care and research applications.

Motivation: 如何在LLM生成的长文本中安全地融入私有信息是一个关键问题。

Method: 通过隔离并裁剪敏感信息，以及从私有标记的小超集中采样，实现差分隐私。

Result: 实验表明，计算成本降低了8倍，生成的长文本质量与非私有生成相当。

Conclusion: InvisibleInk能以低于非私有生成10倍的计算成本生成私有长文本。

Abstract: As major progress in LLM-based long-form text generation enables paradigms
such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inference-time scaling, safely
incorporating private information into the generation remains a critical open
question. We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation
framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to
the sensitive references. It interprets sampling from the LLM's
next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with
two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping
only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public
logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling from a small superset of
the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent
$8\times$ reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to
generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. In
summary, InvisibleInk is able to generate private long-form text at less than
$10\times$ the computation cost of non-private generation.

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了内在几何如何影响学习能力，为结构化数据上的深度学习提供了理论和实践指导。

Abstract: In this work, we develop new generalization bounds for neural networks
trained on data supported on Riemannian manifolds. Existing generalization
theories often rely on complexity measures derived from Euclidean geometry,
which fail to account for the intrinsic structure of non-Euclidean spaces. Our
analysis introduces a geometric refinement: we derive covering number bounds
that explicitly incorporate manifold-specific properties such as sectional
curvature, volume growth, and injectivity radius. These geometric corrections
lead to sharper Rademacher complexity bounds for classes of Lipschitz neural
networks defined on compact manifolds. The resulting generalization guarantees
recover standard Euclidean results when curvature is zero but improve
substantially in settings where the data lies on curved, low-dimensional
manifolds embedded in high-dimensional ambient spaces. We illustrate the
tightness of our bounds in negatively curved spaces, where the exponential
volume growth leads to provably higher complexity, and in positively curved
spaces, where the curvature acts as a regularizing factor. This framework
provides a principled understanding of how intrinsic geometry affects learning
capacity, offering both theoretical insight and practical implications for deep
learning on structured data domains.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for biomedical question
answering raises concerns about the accuracy and evidentiary support of their
responses. To address this, we present Answered with Evidence, a framework for
evaluating whether LLM-generated answers are grounded in scientific literature.
We analyzed thousands of physician-submitted questions using a comparative
pipeline that included: (1) Alexandria, fka the Atropos Evidence Library, a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on novel observational
studies, and (2) two PubMed-based retrieval-augmented systems (System and
Perplexity). We found that PubMed-based systems provided evidence-supported
answers for approximately 44% of questions, while the novel evidence source did
so for about 50%. Combined, these sources enabled reliable answers to over 70%
of biomedical queries. As LLMs become increasingly capable of summarizing
scientific content, maximizing their value will require systems that can
accurately retrieve both published and custom-generated evidence or generate
such evidence in real time.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP)的方法，用于优化大型语言模型（LLM）在交互式问答任务中的顺序查询策略，通过基于一致性预测集的分布无关方法估计不确定性，从而减少查询次数并提高预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的信息追求（IP）策略因难以准确估计LLM的互信息或条件熵而导致查询选择不理想和预测性能下降。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了C-IP方法。

Method: C-IP利用一致性预测集与条件熵之间的关系，通过预测集的平均大小来估计不确定性，避免了传统方法对概率分布的依赖。

Result: 在20 Questions任务中，C-IP相比传统IP和基于不确定性的链式思维方法，表现出更好的预测性能和更短的查询链。在MediQ数据集上的交互式医疗场景中，C-IP与单轮预测性能相当，同时更具可解释性。

Conclusion: C-IP是一种分布无关且鲁棒的顺序信息增益方法，能够有效减少查询次数并提升预测性能，适用于多种交互式任务。

Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs)
is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM
agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant
information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper
explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected
number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy
algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information
gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate
estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very
difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which
leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better
estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information
Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on
conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship
between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate
uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast
to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a
distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with
20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter
query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based
chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical
setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves
competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering
greater interpretability.

Abstract: Multi-material 3D printing, particularly through polymer jetting, enables the
fabrication of digital materials by mixing distinct photopolymers at the micron
scale within a single build to create a composite with tunable mechanical
properties. This work presents an integrated experimental and computational
investigation into the composition-dependent mechanical behavior of 3D printed
digital materials. We experimentally characterize five formulations, combining
soft and rigid UV-cured polymers under uniaxial tension and torsion across
three strain and twist rates. The results reveal nonlinear and rate-dependent
responses that strongly depend on composition. To model this behavior, we
develop a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) that combines a partially
input convex neural network (pICNN) for learning the composition-dependent
hyperelastic strain energy function with a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV)
formulation for time-dependent response. The pICNN ensures convexity with
respect to strain invariants while allowing non-convex dependence on
composition. To enhance interpretability, we apply $L_0$ sparsification. For
the time-dependent response, we introduce a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
predict viscoelastic relaxation parameters from composition. The proposed model
accurately captures the nonlinear, rate-dependent behavior of 3D printed
digital materials in both uniaxial tension and torsion, achieving high
predictive accuracy for interpolated material compositions. This approach
provides a scalable framework for automated, composition-aware constitutive
model discovery for multi-material 3D printing.

Abstract: Linear attention has attracted interest as a computationally efficient
approximation to softmax attention, especially for long sequences. Recent
studies have explored distilling softmax attention in pre-trained Transformers
into linear attention. However, a critical challenge remains: how to choose the
feature dimension that governs the approximation quality. Existing methods fix
this dimension uniformly across all attention layers, overlooking the diverse
roles and complexities of them. In this paper, we propose a principled method
to automatically determine the feature dimension in linear attention using the
concept of statistical degrees of freedom, which represent the effective
dimensionality of the inputs. We provide a theoretical bound on the
approximation error and show that the dimension chosen by our method achieves
smaller error under a fixed computational budget. Furthermore, we introduce an
efficient layerwise training strategy to learn nonlinear features tailored to
each layer. Experiments on multiple pre-trained transformers demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of distilled models compared to baselines
without increasing the inference cost. Our findings also provide insight into
how the complexity of the attention mechanism evolves across layers.

Motivation: 现有医学图像定位方法依赖大量链式思维标注，成本高且耗时。

Abstract: Medical Image Grounding (MIG), which involves localizing specific regions in
medical images based on textual descriptions, requires models to not only
perceive regions but also deduce spatial relationships of these regions.
Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for MIG often rely on Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with large amounts of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently,
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire
reasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without
requiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement
learning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding. We propose the
Spatial-Semantic Rewarded Group Relative Policy Optimization to train the model
without CoT reasoning annotations. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Semantic
Rewards, which combine spatial accuracy reward and semantic consistency reward
to provide nuanced feedback for both spatially positive and negative
completions. Additionally, we propose to use the Chain-of-Box template, which
integrates visual information of referring bounding boxes into the <think>
reasoning process, enabling the model to explicitly reason about spatial
regions during intermediate steps. Experiments on three datasets MS-CXR,
ChestX-ray8, and M3D-RefSeg demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in Medical Image Grounding. Ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of each component in our approach. Code,
checkpoints, and datasets are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种因子化蒙特卡洛Dropout框架，用于分解深度双网络模型中的预测不确定性，分为表示不确定性和预测不确定性，并在合成和真实数据中验证其校准性和诊断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中，需要可靠的点预测和可解释的不确定性量化，以准确估计个体治疗效果。

Method: 采用因子化蒙特卡洛Dropout框架，将总预测方差分解为共享编码器中的表示不确定性（sigma_rep）和结果头中的预测不确定性（sigma_pred）。

Result: 在合成协变量偏移情况下，区间校准良好（ECE < 0.03），且满足sigma_rep^2 + sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2。在真实数据中，表示不确定性在分布外样本中显著增加，成为主要误差预测指标。

Conclusion: 该方法为深度因果效应模型中的不确定性来源提供了实用的诊断工具。

Abstract: Accurate individual treatment-effect estimation in high-stakes applications
demands both reliable point predictions and interpretable uncertainty
quantification. We propose a factorized Monte Carlo Dropout framework for deep
twin-network models that splits total predictive variance into representation
uncertainty (sigma_rep) in the shared encoder and prediction uncertainty
(sigma_pred) in the outcome heads. Across three synthetic covariate-shift
regimes, our intervals are well-calibrated (ECE < 0.03) and satisfy sigma_rep^2
+ sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2. Additionally, we observe a crossover: head
uncertainty leads on in-distribution data, but representation uncertainty
dominates under shift. Finally, on a real-world twins cohort with induced
multivariate shifts, only sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples
(delta sigma ~ 0.0002) and becomes the primary error predictor (rho_rep <=
0.89), while sigma_pred remains flat. This module-level decomposition offers a
practical diagnostic for detecting and interpreting uncertainty sources in deep
causal-effect models.

Conclusion: 结论是提出的方法在交互式模拟环境中表现优越，能够有效规划动作并应对偏差。

Abstract: Learning to perform activities through demonstration requires extracting
meaningful information about the environment from observations. In this
research, we investigate the challenge of planning high-level goal-oriented
actions in a simulation setting from an egocentric perspective. We present a
novel task, interactive action planning, and propose an approach that combines
topological affordance memory with transformer architecture. The process of
memorizing the environment's structure through extracting affordances
facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the
memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific
objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic
interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved
performance and robust when action deviations occur.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯广义线性模型（GLM）的统计框架，用于评估LLM自动评分器的可靠性并检测其潜在偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM自动评分器（如LLM-as-a-judge）虽然可扩展，但存在可靠性不一和系统性偏差的问题，需要更稳健的评估方法。

Method: 使用贝叶斯GLM建模评分结果，考虑评分者和被评分项目的属性，量化评分差异和偏差。

Result: 该方法能同时分析评分器性能和检测偏差，并提供不确定性估计，增强传统可靠性指标。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM自动评分器的使用提供了更稳健和可解释的方法，支持性能分析和偏差检测。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs is increasingly
performed by other LLMs, a setup commonly known as "LLM-as-a-judge", or
autograders. While autograders offer a scalable alternative to human
evaluation, they have shown mixed reliability and may exhibit systematic
biases, depending on response type, scoring methodology, domain specificity,
and other factors. In this paper we propose a statistical framework based on
Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to
simultaneously assess their autograders while also addressing their primary
research questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation
outcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of
the grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response
length or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of
scoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In
addition, our method can be used to augment traditional reliability metrics
such as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and
clarifying the source of disagreement. Overall, this approach contributes to
more robust and interpretable use of autograders in LLM evaluation, enabling
both performance analysis and bias detection.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IMPACT的框架，通过重要性感知的激活重建优化LLM的低秩压缩，显著减少模型大小同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在资源受限环境中部署困难，传统低秩权重压缩假设不适用于LLMs，而激活的低秩结构更显著。

Method: IMPACT框架结合激活结构和梯度敏感性，通过重要性加权激活协方差矩阵的特征向量优化低秩近似。

Result: 实验表明，IMPACT在多种模型和任务中实现高达48.6%的模型大小减少，同时保持与现有基线相当的准确性。

Conclusion: IMPACT通过重要性感知的激活重建，为LLM压缩提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many domains
but are difficult to deploy in resource-constrained settings due to their size.
Low-rank weight matrix compression is a popular strategy for reducing model
size, typically by minimizing weight reconstruction error under the assumption
that weights are low-rank. However, this assumption often does not hold in
LLMs. Instead, LLM activations exhibit stronger low-rank structure-prompting a
shift toward minimizing activation reconstruction error.
  We show that this shift alone is insufficient: activation dimensions
contribute unequally to model performance, and uniform reconstruction can harm
performance. We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware
activation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their
impact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that
considers both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a
closed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the
eigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix. This
enables low-rank approximations explicitly optimized to preserve accuracy.
Experiments across diverse models and tasks show that IMPACT achieves up to
48.6% greater model size reduction with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
baselines.

TL;DR: 通过减少ICD-10代码的粒度，可以在保持模型可解释性和一致性的同时，提高OLS回归的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗成本模型中，平衡可解释性、准确性和参数一致性是一个挑战。高粒度的ICD-10代码作为预测变量时，OLS模型虽然准确但系数不稳定。

Method: 通过截断ICD-10代码的字符数（如从7个字符减少到6个或更少），降低回归问题的维度，同时保留所有诊断代码类别的表示。

Result: 减少ICD-10代码的粒度是一种有效的正则化策略，可以提高OLS回归的稳定性，同时保持模型的解释性。

Conclusion: 研究解释了为什么在实际风险调整和成本模型中，更广泛的诊断分组（如DRGs和HCC代码）比高粒度的ICD-10代码更受欢迎。

Abstract: Cost models in healthcare research must balance interpretability, accuracy,
and parameter consistency. However, interpretable models often struggle to
achieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for
high-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable
regression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic
codes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are
infrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge
can address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we
demonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective
regularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all
diagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters
(e.g., T67.0XXA, T67.0XXD) to six (e.g., T67.0XX) or fewer, we reduce the
dimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model
interpretability and consistency. Mathematically, the merging of predictors in
OLS leads to increased trace of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the variance
of coefficient estimation. Our findings explain why broader diagnostic
groupings like DRGs and HCC codes are favored over highly granular ICD-10 codes
in real-world risk adjustment and cost models.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了毒理基因组数据补全的准确性，还为跨物种药物研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: We explore applying a tensor completion approach to complete the DrugMatrix
toxicogenomics dataset. Our hypothesis is that by preserving the 3-dimensional
structure of the data, which comprises tissue, treatment, and transcriptomic
measurements, and by leveraging a machine learning formulation, our approach
will improve upon prior state-of-the-art results. Our results demonstrate that
the new tensor-based method more accurately reflects the original data
distribution and effectively captures organ-specific variability. The proposed
tensor-based methodology achieved lower mean squared errors and mean absolute
errors compared to both conventional Canonical Polyadic decomposition and
2-dimensional matrix factorization methods. In addition, our non-negative
tensor completion implementation reveals relationships among tissues. Our
findings not only complete the world's largest in-vivo toxicogenomics database
with improved accuracy but also offer a promising methodology for future
studies of drugs that may cross species barriers, for example, from rats to
humans.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, data-driven decision-making has become
indispensable for optimizing systems across Industrial Engineering. This paper
addresses the value of big data analytics by proposing a novel non-linear
hybrid approach for forecasting international tourist arrivals in two different
contexts: (i) arrivals to Hong Kong from five major source nations
(pre-COVID-19), and (ii) arrivals to Sanya in Hainan province, China
(post-COVID-19). The method integrates multiple sources of Internet big data
and employs an innovative game theory-based algorithm to identify opinion
leaders on social media platforms. Subsequently, nonstationary attributes in
tourism demand data are managed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT),
ensuring refined time-frequency analysis. Finally, a memory-aware Stacked
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Stacked BiLSTM) network is used to
generate accurate demand forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that this
approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and remains robust
under dynamic and volatile conditions, highlighting its applicability to
broader Industrial Engineering domains, such as logistics, supply chain
management, and production planning, where forecasting and resource allocation
are key challenges. By merging advanced Deep Learning (DL), time-frequency
analysis, and social media insights, the proposed framework showcases how
large-scale data can elevate the quality and efficiency of decision-making
processes.

Abstract: Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to leverage
knowledge from source tasks to accelerate learning in target tasks. While prior
work, such as the Attend, Adapt, and Transfer (A2T) framework, addresses
negative transfer and selective transfer, other critical challenges remain
underexplored. This paper introduces the Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network
(GATN), a deep RL architecture designed to tackle task generalization across
domains, robustness to environmental changes, and computational efficiency in
transfer. GATN employs a domain-agnostic representation module, a
robustness-aware policy adapter, and an efficient transfer scheduler to achieve
these goals. We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600,
MuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior
performance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments,
and reduced computational overhead compared to baselines. Our findings suggest
GATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive
chatbots and robotic control.

Motivation: 低秩恢复在压缩感知理论中具有重要意义，但现有方法主要针对矩阵数据。为了扩展至高阶张量数据，需要一种有效的张量恢复方法。

Method: 提出TNIHT方法，扩展了NIHT算法至张量领域，支持CP和Tucker两种低秩模型，并在TRIP条件下分析其收敛性。

Result: 理论证明了TNIHT在TRIP条件下的收敛性，并通过合成数据、图像和视频数据的实验验证了其优于现有算法的性能。

Conclusion: TNIHT是一种有效的低秩张量恢复方法，具有理论保证和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Low-rank recovery builds upon ideas from the theory of compressive sensing,
which predicts that sparse signals can be accurately reconstructed from
incomplete measurements. Iterative thresholding-type algorithms-particularly
the normalized iterative hard thresholding (NIHT) method-have been widely used
in compressed sensing (CS) and applied to matrix recovery tasks. In this paper,
we propose a tensor extension of NIHT, referred to as TNIHT, for the recovery
of low-rank tensors under two widely used tensor decomposition models. This
extension enables the effective reconstruction of high-order low-rank tensors
from a limited number of linear measurements by leveraging the inherent
low-dimensional structure of multi-way data. Specifically, we consider both the
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) rank and the Tucker rank to characterize tensor
low-rankness within the TNIHT framework. At the same time, we establish a
convergence theorem for the proposed TNIHT method under the tensor restricted
isometry property (TRIP), providing theoretical support for its recovery
guarantees. Finally, we evaluate the performance of TNIHT through numerical
experiments on synthetic, image, and video data, and compare it with several
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Motivation: 解决不规则几何域上复杂空间相关性和非线性时间动力学的联合建模问题。

Method: 第一阶段使用Koopman增强的图卷积网络（K-GCN）将高维动态嵌入近似线性的潜在空间；第二阶段用Transformer建模潜在空间中的时间依赖关系。

Result: 在心脏动力学预测任务中，TK-GCN表现优于现有基线，预测准确性高。

Conclusion: TK-GCN能有效建模复杂空间结构和非线性时间动态，适用于长程预测。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal dynamics forecasting is inherently challenging, particularly
in systems defined over irregular geometric domains, due to the need to jointly
capture complex spatial correlations and nonlinear temporal dynamics. To tackle
these challenges, we propose TK-GCN, a two-stage framework that integrates
geometry-aware spatial encoding with long-range temporal modeling. In the first
stage, a Koopman-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (K-GCN) is developed to
embed the high-dimensional dynamics distributed on spatially irregular domains
into a latent space where the evolution of system states is approximately
linear. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, this stage enhances the temporal
consistency during the latent learning. In the second stage, a Transformer
module is employed to model the temporal progression within the Koopman-encoded
latent space. Through the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer captures
long-range temporal dependencies, enabling accurate forecasting over extended
horizons. We evaluate TK-GCN in spatiotemporal cardiac dynamics forecasting and
benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results and ablation studies show that TK-GCN consistently
delivers superior predictive accuracy across a range of forecast horizons,
demonstrating its capability to effectively model complex spatial structures
and nonlinear temporal dynamics.

highest predictive accuracy, reflecting stable demand patterns, while Dubai and

Conclusion: 该研究为IRL提供了多角度的理论框架和实用方法，尤其在噪声和动态环境下的应用表现出色。

Abstract: This monograph, spanning three chapters, explores Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL). The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the
third chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient
algorithms.
  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and
extensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent
actions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an
agent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a
cognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also
addresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization
behavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.
  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine
if an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer
(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The
chapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing
the continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random
horizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a
Bayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise
overview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse
stochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.
  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive
Langevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions
given noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms
presented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient
algorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic
gradient algorithm is in operation.

Abstract: We point out that neural networks are not black boxes, and their
generalization stems from the ability to dynamically map a dataset to the local
extrema of the model function. We further prove that the number of local
extrema in a neural network is positively correlated with the number of its
parameters, and on this basis, we give a new algorithm that is different from
the back-propagation algorithm, which we call the extremum-increment algorithm.
Some difficult situations, such as gradient vanishing and overfitting, can be
reasonably explained and dealt with in this framework.

Motivation: 探讨通用逼近器系统的数学极限，揭示其不可避免的灾难性失败特性。

Method: 通过组合必要性、拓扑必要性和实证必要性三个层次论证，证明灾难性失败与表达能力密不可分。

Result: 完美对齐是数学上不可能的，需重新思考如何在不可控性下安全操作。

Conclusion: UAT安全应从追求完美控制转向在不可控性下安全操作，对开发和治理有深远影响。

Abstract: We establish fundamental mathematical limits on universal approximation
theorem (UAT) system alignment by proving that catastrophic failures are an
inescapable feature of any useful computational system. Our central thesis is
that for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful
computation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make
perfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a
three-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal
approximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of
practical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we
prove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional
to the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any
theoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the
ability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the
dense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical
Necessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is
empirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing
any successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results,
combined with a quantitative "Impossibility Sandwich" showing that the minimum
complexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety,
demonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a
mathematical impossibility. This foundational result reframes UAT safety from a
problem of "how to achieve perfect control" to one of "how to operate safely in
the presence of irreducible uncontrollability," with profound implications for
the future of UAT development and governance.

*Kosuke Imai,Kentaro Nakamura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPI是一种利用生成式AI模型进行因果和预测推断的统计框架，适用于非结构化数据（如文本和图像），无需微调生成模型，计算高效且易于使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在非结构化数据的因果和预测推断中存在局限性，GPI旨在通过生成式AI模型提取低维表示，解决这一问题。

Method: 利用开源生成式AI模型（如大语言模型和扩散模型）生成非结构化数据并提取低维表示，结合机器学习进行推断。

Result: GPI在三个应用中展示了其多功能性：分析中国社交媒体审查、估计候选人面部特征对选举结果的影响、评估政治修辞的说服力。

Conclusion: GPI为因果和预测推断提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于多种非结构化数据场景。

Abstract: We introduce GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI), a statistical framework for both
causal and predictive inference using unstructured data, including text and
images. GPI leverages open-source Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)
models - such as large language models and diffusion models - not only to
generate unstructured data at scale but also to extract low-dimensional
representations that capture their underlying structure. Applying machine
learning to these representations, GPI enables estimation of causal and
predictive effects while quantifying associated estimation uncertainty. Unlike
existing approaches to representation learning, GPI does not require
fine-tuning of generative models, making it computationally efficient and
broadly accessible. We illustrate the versatility of the GPI framework through
three applications: (1) analyzing Chinese social media censorship, (2)
estimating predictive effects of candidates' facial appearance on electoral
outcomes, and (3) assessing the persuasiveness of political rhetoric. An
open-source software package is available for implementing GPI.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种四层分类法，用于定义和保护生成式AI中的数据，强调数据保护在现代AI中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI时代重塑了数据的意义和价值，传统数据保护方法已不足以应对新挑战，亟需明确保护范围和严格实施。

Method: 提出四层分类法（非可用性、隐私保护、可追溯性和可删除性），分析每层的技术方法并揭示监管盲点。

Result: 框架为AI技术和治理提供了结构化视角，平衡数据效用与控制，并指导开发者、研究者和监管者。

Conclusion: 需重新思考现代AI技术中的数据保护，框架为未来AI技术和治理提供了及时指导。

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the
meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now
permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape
model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model
deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection
insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly
defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and
individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and
rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a
four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation,
traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs
arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a
structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control,
spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights,
system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical
approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical
assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies
and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of
rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance
for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

*Mehrdad Moghimi,Hyejin Ku*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化静态谱风险度量（SRM）的新框架，适用于在线和离线强化学习，解决了现有风险敏感方法在关键场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风险敏感方法在关键场景中可能产生次优策略，导致严重后果，需要更灵活的风险度量框架。

Method: 提出了一种优化静态谱风险度量（SRM）的框架，适用于在线和离线强化学习，并证明了有限状态-动作设置下的收敛性。

Result: 通过实验验证，该方法在多种领域中优于现有风险敏感方法。

Conclusion: 新框架为风险敏感强化学习提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The development of Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has introduced
a natural way to incorporate risk sensitivity into value-based and actor-critic
methods by employing risk measures other than expectation in the value
function. While this approach is widely adopted in many online and offline RL
algorithms due to its simplicity, the naive integration of risk measures often
results in suboptimal policies. This limitation can be particularly harmful in
scenarios where the need for effective risk-sensitive policies is critical and
worst-case outcomes carry severe consequences. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel framework for optimizing static Spectral Risk Measures (SRM), a
flexible family of risk measures that generalizes objectives such as CVaR and
Mean-CVaR, and enables the tailoring of risk preferences. Our method is
applicable to both online and offline RL algorithms. We establish theoretical
guarantees by proving convergence in the finite state-action setting. Moreover,
through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithms
consistently outperform existing risk-sensitive methods in both online and
offline environments across diverse domains.

### [80] [Adaptive Cubic Regularized Second-Order Latent Factor Analysis Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03036)
*Jialiang Wang,Junzhou Wang,Xin Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应立方正则化二阶潜在因子分析（ACRSLF）模型，用于高效处理高维不完整数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维不完整数据在现实应用中普遍存在，但现有二阶潜在因子模型因目标函数的双线性和非凸性，优化不稳定且参数调优复杂。

Method: ACRSLF采用自调谐立方正则化和多Hessian-向量乘积评估，动态缓解非凸优化问题并精确吸收二阶信息。

Result: 在工业数据集上的实验表明，ACRSLF收敛更快且表示精度优于现有优化器驱动的LFA模型。

Conclusion: ACRSLF为高维不完整数据的建模提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data, characterized by massive node
interactions, have become ubiquitous across various real-world applications.
Second-order latent factor models have shown promising performance in modeling
this type of data. Nevertheless, due to the bilinear and non-convex nature of
the SLF model's objective function, incorporating a damping term into the
Hessian approximation and carefully tuning associated parameters become
essential. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new approach in this
study, named the adaptive cubic regularized second-order latent factor analysis
(ACRSLF) model. The proposed ACRSLF adopts the two-fold ideas: 1) self-tuning
cubic regularization that dynamically mitigates non-convex optimization
instabilities; 2) multi-Hessian-vector product evaluation during conjugate
gradient iterations for precise second-order information assimilation.
Comprehensive experiments on two industrial HDI datasets demonstrate that the
ACRSLF converges faster and achieves higher representation accuracy than the
advancing optimizer-based LFA models.

*Henry B. Moss,Sebastian W. Ober,Tom Diethe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦方法，将生成模型（VAE）与高斯过程（GP）代理模型分开训练，并通过贝叶斯更新规则结合，以优化复杂结构域（如分子空间）中的任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将代理模型与生成模型紧密耦合，导致潜在空间未针对特定任务优化时性能不佳。

Method: 分别训练VAE和GP代理模型，通过贝叶斯更新规则结合两者。

Result: 在有限评估预算下，解耦方法能更有效地识别高潜力分子候选。

Conclusion: 解耦方法优于现有耦合方法，尤其在复杂结构优化任务中表现更优。

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation in the latent space of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)
is a powerful framework for optimisation tasks over complex structured domains,
such as the space of scientifically interesting molecules. However, existing
approaches tightly couple the surrogate and generative models, which can lead
to suboptimal performance when the latent space is not tailored to specific
tasks, which in turn has led to the proposal of increasingly sophisticated
algorithms. In this work, we explore a new direction, instead proposing a
decoupled approach that trains a generative model and a Gaussian Process (GP)
surrogate separately, then combines them via a simple yet principled Bayesian
update rule. This separation allows each component to focus on its strengths --
structure generation from the VAE and predictive modelling by the GP. We show
that our decoupled approach improves our ability to identify high-potential
candidates in molecular optimisation problems under constrained evaluation
budgets.

TL;DR: Optimas是一个统一框架，用于优化复合AI系统，通过局部奖励函数（LRF）实现组件独立优化，提升全局性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复合AI系统（如大语言模型与专用工具结合）的优化因非可微分结构和多样化配置而具有挑战性。

Method: Optimas为每个组件维护一个局部奖励函数（LRF），确保局部与全局性能对齐，并通过迭代优化提升性能。

Result: 在五个实际系统中，Optimas平均性能提升11.92%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Optimas为复合系统提供了一种通用且高效的优化方法。

Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language
Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are
increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing
compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures
and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts,
hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose
Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.
The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per
component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each
component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each
iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while
simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables
independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated
optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead
to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world
compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an
average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for
improving compound systems. Our website is at https://optimas.stanford.edu.

Motivation: 探索如何通过继续预训练提升基于合成数据预训练的表格数据基础模型的性能。

Method: 在精选的大型真实数据集上进行继续预训练，而非使用更广泛但可能噪声较多的数据源。

Result: Real-TabPFN在OpenML AutoML Benchmark的29个数据集上表现显著优于原模型。

Conclusion: 针对性的继续预训练策略能有效提升模型性能，尤其是在真实数据集上。

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data, like TabPFN, achieve strong performance
on small datasets when pre-trained solely on synthetic data. We show that this
performance can be significantly boosted by a targeted continued pre-training
phase. Specifically, we demonstrate that leveraging a small, curated collection
of large, real-world datasets for continued pre-training yields superior
downstream predictive accuracy compared to using broader, potentially noisier
corpora like CommonCrawl or GitTables. Our resulting model, Real-TabPFN,
achieves substantial performance gains on 29 datasets from the OpenML AutoML
Benchmark.

Motivation: 揭示优化方法在实现人工认知中的根本局限性，推动AI领域寻找新方法。

Result: 优化方法存在固有缺陷，世界建模方法能避免这些问题。

Conclusion: AI领域需超越机器学习，探索其他方法以实现人工认知。

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence field has focused on developing optimisation
methods to solve multiple problems, specifically problems that we thought to be
only solvable through cognition. The obtained results have been outstanding,
being able to even surpass the Turing Test. However, we have found that these
optimisation methods share some fundamental flaws that impede them to become a
true artificial cognition. Specifically, the field have identified catastrophic
forgetting as a fundamental problem to develop such cognition. This paper
formally proves that this problem is inherent to optimisation methods, and as
such it will always limit approaches that try to solve the Artificial General
Intelligence problem as an optimisation problem. Additionally, it addresses the
problem of overfitting and discuss about other smaller problems that
optimisation methods pose. Finally, it empirically shows how world-modelling
methods avoid suffering from either problem. As a conclusion, the field of
Artificial Intelligence needs to look outside the machine learning field to
find methods capable of developing an artificial cognition.

Abstract: The ability to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with constraints is
instrumental in improving the fairness of modern machine-learning models. Many
algorithms have been analysed in recent years, and yet there is no standard,
widely accepted method for the constrained training of DNNs. In this paper, we
provide a challenging benchmark of real-world large-scale fairness-constrained
learning tasks, built on top of the US Census (Folktables). We point out the
theoretical challenges of such tasks and review the main approaches in
stochastic approximation algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the
benchmark by implementing and comparing three recently proposed, but as-of-yet
unimplemented, algorithms both in terms of optimization performance, and
fairness improvement. We release the code of the benchmark as a Python package

TL;DR: 提出了一种运行时验证算法公平性的通用框架，适用于模型未知但具有马尔可夫链结构的系统，支持多种公平性属性的监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习系统广泛用于人类决策，确保其公平性（不基于敏感属性偏袒个体）至关重要。

Method: 引入一种规范语言建模常见公平性属性（如人口平等、机会均等），构建监控器实时评估系统公平性，并提供统计保证。

Result: 监控算法分为两类（统一误差界和非均匀误差界），实验表明监控器能在毫秒内更新评估结果。

Conclusion: 该框架有效验证系统公平性，适用于实际场景（如银行贷款、大学招生），具有高效性和统计可靠性。

Abstract: Machine-learned systems are in widespread use for making decisions about
humans, and it is important that they are fair, i.e., not biased against
individuals based on sensitive attributes.
  We present a general framework of runtime verification of algorithmic
fairness for systems whose models are unknown, but are assumed to have a Markov
chain structure, with or without full observation of the state space.
  We introduce a specification language that can model many common algorithmic
fairness properties, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and social
burden.
  We build monitors that observe a long sequence of events as generated by a
given system, and output, after each observation, a quantitative estimate of
how fair or biased the system was on that run until that point in time.
  The estimate is proven to be correct modulo a variable error bound and a
given confidence level, where the error bound gets tighter as the observed
sequence gets longer.
  We present two categories of monitoring algorithms, namely ones with a
uniform error bound across all time points, and ones with weaker non-uniform,
pointwise error bounds at different time points.
  Our monitoring algorithms use statistical tools that are adapted to suit the
dynamic requirements of monitoring and the special needs of the fairness
specifications.
  Using a prototype implementation, we show how we can monitor if a bank is
fair in giving loans to applicants from different social backgrounds, and if a
college is fair in admitting students while maintaining a reasonable financial
burden on the society.
  In these experiments, our monitors took less than a millisecond to update
their verdicts after each observation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种基于影响函数（IF）的数据评估方法，用于解决Sharpness-aware Minimization（SAM）中的数据影响评估问题，分别基于Hessian矩阵和梯度轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在训练中通过内环最大化损失、外环最小化损失的双重结构，使得传统数据影响评估工具（如影响函数）不适用或不准确。

Method: 开发了两种数据评估方法：基于Hessian的IF和基于梯度轨迹的IF，分别适用于不同场景。

Result: 实验证明这两种方法在数据评估和参数调优中有效，可用于识别错误标记数据、模型编辑和增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为SAM中的数据影响评估提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale
model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However,
challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as
significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of
specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly
rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions
(IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to
find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then
minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this
bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters.
In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation
methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the
Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a
comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that
relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM
utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and
efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their
effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in
identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了8:16半结构化稀疏方法，在保持性能的同时超越性能阈值，并展示了其在灵活性和存储效率上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模的增大，高效的压缩技术（如量化和稀疏化）变得至关重要。然而，结构化稀疏方法（如N:M稀疏化）因灵活性和对异常权重的敏感性不足而表现不佳。

Method: 研究了8:16半结构化稀疏方法，并应用稀疏结构化模式处理显著权重，同时采用方差校正和类似SmoothQuant的权重均衡技术。

Result: 8:16稀疏化在性能上超越2:4稀疏化，具有更高的灵活性且存储开销更低。结构化稀疏方法在异常权重处理上与无结构化方法竞争性相当或更优。

Conclusion: 8:16半结构化稀疏方法是一种高效的压缩技术，结合简单优化技术可进一步提升稀疏模型的性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, efficient compression
techniques like quantization and sparsification are critical. While
quantization maintains performance with reduced precision, structured sparsity
methods, such as N:M sparsification, often fall short due to limited
flexibility, and sensitivity to outlier weights. We explore 8:16
semi-structured sparsity, demonstrating its ability to surpass the Performance
Threshold-where a compressed model matches the accuracy of its uncompressed or
smaller counterpart under equivalent memory constraints. Compared to 2:4
sparsity, 8:16 offers greater flexibility with minimal storage overhead (0.875
vs. 0.75 bits/element). We also apply sparse structured patterns for salient
weights, showing that structured sparsity for outliers is competitive with
unstructured approaches leading to equivalent or better results. Finally, we
demonstrate that simple techniques such as variance correction and SmoothQuant
like weight equalization improve sparse models performance.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，CLAGA显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: CLAGA是一种有效的解决方案，适用于任何CATE估计算法，能够消除不一致性并提升性能。

Abstract: Numerous algorithms have been developed for Conditional Average Treatment
Effect (CATE) estimation. In this paper, we first highlight a common issue
where many algorithms exhibit inconsistent learning behavior for the same
instance across different group assignments. We introduce a metric to quantify
and visualize this inconsistency. Next, we present a theoretical analysis
showing that this inconsistency indeed contributes to higher test errors and
cannot be resolved through conventional machine learning techniques. To address
this problem, we propose a general method called \textbf{Consistent Labeling
Across Group Assignments} (CLAGA), which eliminates the inconsistency and is
applicable to any existing CATE estimation algorithm. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance
improvements with CLAGA.

Result: 元学习模型在2类任务中优于VLLMs，而VLLMs在3类任务中略优，但其可靠性需进一步验证。

Conclusion: VLLMs虽表现良好，但实际应用仍需更多研究。

Abstract: With the rise of online learning, the demand for efficient and consistent
assessment in mathematics has significantly increased over the past decade.
Machine Learning (ML), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), has been
widely used for autograding student responses, particularly those involving
text and/or mathematical expressions. However, there has been limited research
on autograding responses involving students' handwritten graphs, despite their
prevalence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
curricula. In this study, we implement multimodal meta-learning models for
autograding images containing students' handwritten graphs and text. We further
compare the performance of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with these
specially trained metalearning models. Our results, evaluated on a real-world
dataset collected from our institution, show that the best-performing
meta-learning models outperform VLLMs in 2-way classification tasks. In
contrast, in more complex 3-way classification tasks, the best-performing VLLMs
slightly outperform the meta-learning models. While VLLMs show promising
results, their reliability and practical applicability remain uncertain and
require further investigation.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集（如TCGA-BRCA基因表达数据）上验证，方法能准确恢复理论预期结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于交互分析的特征选择或模型开发提供了潜在应用。

Abstract: Understanding the contribution of individual features in predictive models
remains a central goal in interpretable machine learning, and while many
model-agnostic methods exist to estimate feature importance, they often fall
short in capturing high-order interactions and disentangling overlapping
contributions. In this work, we present an information-theoretic extension of
the High-order interactions for Feature importance (Hi-Fi) method, leveraging
Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) estimated via a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
approach working on mixed discrete and continuous random variables. Our
framework decomposes feature contributions into unique, synergistic, and
redundant components, offering a richer, model-independent understanding of
their predictive roles. We validate the method using synthetic datasets with
known Gaussian structures, where ground truth interaction patterns are
analytically derived, and further test it on non-Gaussian and real-world gene
expression data from TCGA-BRCA. Results indicate that the proposed estimator
accurately recovers theoretical and expected findings, providing a potential
use case for developing feature selection algorithms or model development based
on interaction analysis.

Conclusion: BERT4Traj能有效重建详细连续的移动轨迹，提升对人类移动模式的理解。

Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications in public health,
transportation, and urban planning. However, mobility data often suffers from
sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS
sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during
communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a
transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by
predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's
masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj
leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background
features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real
world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains,
KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs
detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human
movement patterns.

best policy in a given class of interest $\Pi$ -- crucially, without assuming
that $\Pi$ contains the optimal policy. We propose a general policy learning
framework that reduces this problem to first-order optimization in a
non-Euclidean space, leading to new algorithms as well as shedding light on the
convergence properties of existing ones. Specifically, under the assumption
that $\Pi$ is convex and satisfies a variational gradient dominance (VGD)
condition -- an assumption known to be strictly weaker than more standard
completeness and coverability conditions -- we obtain sample complexity upper
bounds for three policy learning algorithms: \emph{(i)} Steepest Descent Policy
Optimization, derived from a constrained steepest descent method for non-convex
optimization; \emph{(ii)} the classical Conservative Policy Iteration algorithm
\citep{kakade2002approximately} reinterpreted through the lens of the
Frank-Wolfe method, which leads to improved convergence results; and
\emph{(iii)} an on-policy instantiation of the well-studied Policy Mirror
Descent algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate the VGD condition across
several standard environments, demonstrating the practical relevance of our key
assumption.

TL;DR: 提出了Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine (C²HM)，通过目标驱动的非对称推理改进传统Helmholtz Machine，支持记忆链推理和空间组合想象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Helmholtz Machine依赖对称的数据驱动更新，限制了其目标导向推理和时序扩展模拟的能力。

Method: C²HM将推理重构为目标驱动的非对称过程，通过前向生成和逆向细化的循环一致性机制，结合变分循环实现目标与观测的对齐。

Result: C²HM提高了表示效率，支持路径依赖推理和空间组合想象，为生成建模提供了意图驱动的模拟框架。

Conclusion: C²HM通过生物启发的非对称推理，统一了记忆规划和无监督学习，拓展了生成建模的能力。

Abstract: The Helmholtz Machine (HM) is a foundational architecture for unsupervised
learning, coupling a bottom-up recognition model with a top-down generative
model through alternating inference. However, its reliance on symmetric,
data-driven updates constrains its ability to perform goal-directed reasoning
or simulate temporally extended processes. In this work, we introduce the
\emph{Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine} (C$^2$HM), a novel extension that
reframes inference as a \emph{goal-seeded}, \emph{asymmetric} process grounded
in structured internal priors. Rather than inferring latent causes solely from
sensory data, C$^2$HM simulates plausible latent trajectories conditioned on
abstract goals, aligning them with observed outcomes through a recursive cycle
of forward generation and inverse refinement. This cycle-consistent formulation
integrates top-down structure with bottom-up evidence via a variational loop,
enforcing mutual alignment between goal-conditioned latent predictions and
recognition-based reconstructions. We formalize this mechanism within the
framework of the \emph{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle} (CCUP), which
posits that inference proceeds by aligning structured, low-entropy content with
high-entropy, ambiguous context. C$^2$HM improves representational efficiency,
supports memory chaining via path-dependent inference, and enables spatial
compositional imagination. By offering a biologically inspired alternative to
classical amortized inference, $C^2$HM reconceives generative modeling as
intentional simulation, bridging memory-based planning and unsupervised
learning in a unified probabilistic framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无限宽神经网络中的迁移学习理论，分析了贝叶斯框架和梯度流训练，揭示了特征重用、任务对齐等因素对迁移学习效果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在特征学习机制下，预训练（源任务）和下游任务（目标任务）的迁移学习理论，探索特征重用和任务对齐对迁移学习效果的作用。

Method: 采用贝叶斯框架和梯度流训练方法，分析权重后验分布和特征核的演化，引入弹性权重耦合机制控制特征重用。

Result: 理论和实验表明，弹性权重耦合、特征学习强度、数据集大小以及任务对齐对迁移学习效果有显著影响。

Conclusion: 该理论为理解迁移学习中的特征重用和任务对齐提供了新视角，并在实际数据集中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks
where both the pretraining (source) and downstream (target) task can operate in
a feature learning regime. We analyze both the Bayesian framework, where
learning is described by a posterior distribution over the weights, and
gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight
decay. Both settings track how representations evolve in both source and target
tasks. The summary statistics of these theories are adapted feature kernels
which, after transfer learning, depend on data and labels from both source and
target tasks. Reuse of features during transfer learning is controlled by an
elastic weight coupling which controls the reliance of the network on features
learned during training on the source task. We apply our theory to linear and
polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory and
experiments reveal interesting interplays between elastic weight coupling,
feature learning strength, dataset size, and source and target task alignment
on the utility of transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究强化学习中代理目标可能导致的行为偏离设计者意图的问题，即目标泛化错误。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，比较MEV和MMER目标在程序生成的网格世界环境中的表现。

Result: MEV目标下存在目标泛化错误，而MMER方法（如UED）表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 最小最大期望遗憾（MMER）是缓解目标泛化错误的有效方法。

Abstract: Safe generalization in reinforcement learning requires not only that a
learned policy acts capably in new situations, but also that it uses its
capabilities towards the pursuit of the designer's intended goal. The latter
requirement may fail when a proxy goal incentivizes similar behavior to the
intended goal within the training environment, but not in novel deployment
environments. This creates the risk that policies will behave as if in pursuit
of the proxy goal, rather than the intended goal, in deployment -- a phenomenon
known as goal misgeneralization. In this paper, we formalize this problem
setting in order to theoretically study the possibility of goal
misgeneralization under different training objectives. We show that goal
misgeneralization is possible under approximate optimization of the maximum
expected value (MEV) objective, but not the minimax expected regret (MMER)
objective. We then empirically show that the standard MEV-based training method
of domain randomization exhibits goal misgeneralization in
procedurally-generated grid-world environments, whereas current regret-based
unsupervised environment design (UED) methods are more robust to goal
misgeneralization (though they don't find MMER policies in all cases). Our
findings suggest that minimax expected regret is a promising approach to
mitigating goal misgeneralization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的上下文异常检测（CAD）框架——正常性评分（NS），通过显式建模随机和认知不确定性，提高了检测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多异常检测任务中，存在影响目标变量正常性的上下文变量，但这些变量本身并非异常指标。现有方法未能充分建模不确定性。

Method: 基于异方差高斯过程回归，将Z-score视为随机变量，提供反映异常评估可靠性的置信区间。

Result: 在基准数据集和心脏病学实际应用中，NS在检测准确性和可解释性上优于现有CAD方法。

Conclusion: NS框架通过不确定性驱动的决策过程，在医疗等领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Contextual anomaly detection (CAD) aims to identify anomalies in a target
(behavioral) variable conditioned on a set of contextual variables that
influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators
of anomaly. In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables
that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves
indicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD,
normalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method
regards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that
reflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on
benchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate
that NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and
interpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive,
uncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in
domains such as healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学成像常面对间接、噪声、稀疏的未知动态，需新方法重建。

Result: 在风速场与等离子体演化重建中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: NeuralDMD为跨领域动态系统成像提供通用工具。

Abstract: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from
turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins.
Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging
often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy,
and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework
that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such
measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing
complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce
an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional
representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world
problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from
sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the
Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms
established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for
imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在多任务线性回归中调整L1和L2正则化超参数的问题，提出了基于数据分布特性的泛化误差边界，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据回归问题中，正则化超参数的调整对避免过拟合和保证变量选择至关重要。现有方法对所有分布统一的边界在高维下表现不佳。

Method: 通过假设数据分布满足特定条件（如子高斯分布），推导出泛化误差的分布依赖边界，适用于L1、L2及弹性网络正则化。

Result: 在数据分布“良好”时，泛化误差边界不随维度增加而恶化，且在高维下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用数据分布特性，提出了更紧的泛化误差边界，为高维回归问题提供了更优的理论保证。

Abstract: Modern regression problems often involve high-dimensional data and a careful
tuning of the regularization hyperparameters is crucial to avoid overly complex
models that may overfit the training data while guaranteeing desirable
properties like effective variable selection. We study the recently introduced
direction of tuning regularization hyperparameters in linear regression across
multiple related tasks. We obtain distribution-dependent bounds on the
generalization error for the validation loss when tuning the L1 and L2
coefficients, including ridge, lasso and the elastic net. In contrast, prior
work develops bounds that apply uniformly to all distributions, but such bounds
necessarily degrade with feature dimension, d. While these bounds are shown to
be tight for worst-case distributions, our bounds improve with the "niceness"
of the data distribution. Concretely, we show that under additional assumptions
that instances within each task are i.i.d. draws from broad well-studied
classes of distributions including sub-Gaussians, our generalization bounds do
not get worse with increasing d, and are much sharper than prior work for very
large d. We also extend our results to a generalization of ridge regression,
where we achieve tighter bounds that take into account an estimate of the mean
of the ground truth distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法多专注于显式或隐式关系，缺乏同时支持两者的现代框架，且未充分利用重复结构模式加速搜索。

Method: SymMatika结合多岛遗传编程和生物序列分析启发的模式库，识别高性能子结构并重用，同时支持显式和隐式关系发现。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，性能提升5.1%，首次恢复Nguyen-12，并在Feynman方程上表现竞争性，隐式物理定律发现速度提升100倍。

Conclusion: 结构感知进化搜索对科学发现具有强大潜力，SymMatika已开源以支持可解释建模和符号发现研究。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical
expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced
the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or
discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and
accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each
expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural
patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR
algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable
motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies
high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to
guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven
evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery
using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves
state-of-the-art recovery rates, achieving 5.1% higher performance than the
previous best results on Nguyen, the first recovery of Nguyen-12, and
competitive performance on the Feynman equations. It also recovers implicit
physical laws from Eureqa datasets up to $100\times$ faster. Our results
demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific
discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic
discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DICE方法是一种生成建模方法，通过学习有限时间点样本群体的演化来捕捉平滑的群体动态，而非复杂的个体轨迹动态。其损失函数具有不变性，训练稳定且高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉群体动态的平滑性，且训练不稳定，DICE旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DICE通过设计不变性损失函数，直接在时间区间内生成样本群体轨迹，避免逐时间步采样。

Result: DICE训练稳定，生成样本成本低，适用于随机波、高维混沌等问题。

Conclusion: DICE是一种高效、稳定的群体动态建模方法，优于传统方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Inverse Continuity Equation (DICE) method, a
generative modeling approach that learns the evolution of a stochastic process
from given sample populations at a finite number of time points. Models learned
with DICE capture the typically smooth and well-behaved population dynamics,
rather than the dynamics of individual sample trajectories that can exhibit
complex or even chaotic behavior. The DICE loss function is developed
specifically to be invariant, even in discrete time, to spatially constant but
time-varying spurious constants that can emerge during training; this
invariance increases training stability and robustness. Generating a trajectory
of sample populations with DICE is fast because samples evolve directly in the
time interval over which the stochastic process is formulated, in contrast to
approaches that condition on time and then require multiple sampling steps per
time step. DICE is stable to train, in situations where other methods for
learning population dynamics fail, and DICE generates representative samples
with orders of magnitude lower costs than methods that have to condition on
time. Numerical experiments on a wide range of problems from random waves,
Vlasov-Poisson instabilities and high-dimensional chaos are included to justify
these assertions.

Conclusion: BLaST通过降低能耗、内存占用和延迟，推动下一代大规模AI系统发展。

Abstract: The energy consumption of large-scale ML models is dominated by data movement
- shuffling billions of parameters across memory hierarchies and data centers.
Effective sparsification to prune redundant parameters is still challenging:
existing methods incur significant accuracy degradation, performance overhead,
or both. We introduce (Bl)ock (a)nd (S)parse (T)ransformers (BLaST), a general,
robust, and reliable sparsification method applicable to linear layers in all
settings. Our method iteratively sparsifies weight matrices into a block
sparsity pattern suitable for efficient sparse matrix-matrix (SpMM)
multiplication. BLaST achieves up to 95% sparsity in MLP weights with
negligible accuracy loss. Our fused, highly optimized Sparse MLP kernel
delivers up to 16.7x speedup over dense MLPs across 9 architectures and 8
datasets, resulting in up to 1.6x inference speedup, 1.11x pretraining speedup
and up to 3.12x inference memory usage reduction. BLaST enables the next
generation of large-scale AI systems by reducing energy use, memory footprint,
and latency.

Result: 实验证明QuEst在经济建模、民意调查和语言模型自评估中具有实用性。

Conclusion: QuEst扩展了混合推断工具的能力，适用于多种分位数相关度量。

Abstract: As machine learning models grow increasingly competent, their predictions can
supplement scarce or expensive data in various important domains. In support of
this paradigm, algorithms have emerged to combine a small amount of
high-fidelity observed data with a much larger set of imputed model outputs to
estimate some quantity of interest. Yet current hybrid-inference tools target
only means or single quantiles, limiting their applicability for many critical
domains and use cases. We present QuEst, a principled framework to merge
observed and imputed data to deliver point estimates and rigorous confidence
intervals for a wide family of quantile-based distributional measures. QuEst
covers a range of measures, from tail risk (CVaR) to population segments such
as quartiles, that are central to fields such as economics, sociology,
education, medicine, and more. We extend QuEst to multidimensional metrics, and
introduce an additional optimization technique to further reduce variance in
this and other hybrid estimators. We demonstrate the utility of our framework
through experiments in economic modeling, opinion polling, and language model
auto-evaluation.

Conclusion: 神经网络方法在计算磁流体力学平衡方面具有潜力，未来可扩展到连续分布的平衡模型。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic
equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and
compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear
global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with
first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to
arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased
computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural
networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use
minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for
solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing
neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

Motivation: 探究LLMs在自信与怀疑之间的矛盾行为，揭示其背后的机制。

Method: 开发新实验范式，利用LLMs获取无记忆干扰的置信度估计，测试Gemma 3、GPT4o和o1-preview等模型。

Result: LLMs表现出选择支持性偏差，强化初始答案的置信度，并对不一致建议过度敏感，偏离贝叶斯更新规范。

Conclusion: LLMs的固执和对批评的过度敏感可由一致性维护机制和不一致反馈的过度反应机制解释。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strikingly conflicting behaviors: they
can appear steadfastly overconfident in their initial answers whilst at the
same time being prone to excessive doubt when challenged. To investigate this
apparent paradox, we developed a novel experimental paradigm, exploiting the
unique ability to obtain confidence estimates from LLMs without creating memory
of their initial judgments -- something impossible in human participants. We
show that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced
choice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence
in their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind. We
further demonstrate that LLMs markedly overweight inconsistent compared to
consistent advice, in a fashion that deviates qualitatively from normative
Bayesian updating. Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms -- a drive
to maintain consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to
contradictory feedback -- parsimoniously capture LLM behavior in a different
domain. Together, these findings furnish a mechanistic account of LLM
confidence that explains both their stubbornness and excessive sensitivity to
criticism.

Conclusion: 集合值预测是提升域泛化鲁棒性的有前景方向。

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements in modern machine learning, achieving
robustness in Domain Generalization (DG) tasks remains a significant challenge.
In DG, models are expected to perform well on samples from unseen test
distributions (also called domains), by learning from multiple related training
distributions. Most existing approaches to this problem rely on single-valued
predictions, which inherently limit their robustness. We argue that set-valued
predictors could be leveraged to enhance robustness across unseen domains,
while also taking into account that these sets should be as small as possible.
We introduce a theoretical framework defining successful set prediction in the
DG setting, focusing on meeting a predefined performance criterion across as
many domains as possible, and provide theoretical insights into the conditions
under which such domain generalization is achievable. We further propose a
practical optimization method compatible with modern learning architectures,
that balances robust performance on unseen domains with small prediction set
sizes. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets from the WILDS
benchmark, demonstrating its potential as a promising direction for robust
domain generalization.

TL;DR: HGCA是一种混合CPU-GPU注意力机制，通过结合GPU内存中的密集注意力和CPU内存中的稀疏注意力，实现了高效、高吞吐量的LLM推理，同时保持接近全注意力的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型（LLM）推理受限于GPU内存，尤其是长上下文生成所需的关键值（KV）缓存。现有方法（如卸载KV缓存到CPU或稀疏注意力）未能充分利用CPU计算资源且影响准确性。

Method: HGCA采用混合注意力机制：GPU内存中保留最近生成的KV条目进行密集注意力，CPU内存中对选定的重要KV条目进行并行稀疏注意力，并通过log-sum-exp融合高效合并输出。此外，HGCA引入细粒度、每头稀疏化策略优化CPU执行。

Result: 实验表明，HGCA在多种模型和工作负载下表现出卓越的可扩展性，支持更长的序列和更大的批量，同时在性能和准确性上优于现有稀疏注意力基线。

Conclusion: HGCA在无需重新训练模型的情况下，实现了高效、高吞吐量的LLM推理，为长上下文生成提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling inference for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by limited GPU memory, especially due to growing key-value (KV)
caches required for long-context generation. While existing approaches offload
KV caches to CPU memory or apply sparse attention to reduce GPU load, they
often underutilize CPU compute resources and compromise accuracy. We present
HGCA, a hybrid CPU-GPU attention mechanism that enables scalable,
high-throughput LLM inference with near-full attention quality. HGCA performs
dense attention on recently generated KV entries retained in GPU memory and
parallel sparse attention on selected, salient KV entries in CPU memory. The
attention outputs are efficiently merged using log-sum-exp fusion, minimizing
PCIe transfer overhead. HGCA also introduces a finegrained, per-head
sparsification strategy optimized for CPU execution, preserving contextual
relevance while reducing computation. Our implementation seamlessly integrates
into existing LLM frameworks without requiring model retraining. Experiments
across diverse models and workloads show that HGCA achieves superior
scalability, supports longer sequences and larger batch sizes, and outperforms
existing sparse attention baselines in both performance and accuracy -- all on
commodity GPU hardware.

TL;DR: PiCME提出了一种多模态对比学习方法，通过整合临床数据（文本、影像、时间序列等）提升预测性能，并引入Modality-Gated LSTM解决多模态性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态深度学习在临床预测中潜力巨大，但现有方法多局限于图像和文本对，缺乏对其他数据类型的系统评估。

Method: 提出PiCME框架，预训练26种多模态组合的对比模型，并引入Modality-Gated LSTM动态加权各模态重要性。

Result: 对比模型在三模态下表现优异，五模态时性能下降但通过LSTM提升（AUROC从73.19%到76.93%）。

Conclusion: PiCME为多模态选择、训练策略和公平性提供了指导，是首个在MIMIC中全面评估多模态对比学习的方法。

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning holds promise for improving clinical prediction by
integrating diverse patient data, including text, imaging, time-series, and
structured demographics. Contrastive learning facilitates this integration by
producing a unified representation that can be reused across tasks, reducing
the need for separate models or encoders. Although contrastive learning has
seen success in vision-language domains, its use in clinical settings remains
largely limited to image and text pairs. We propose the Pipeline for
Contrastive Modality Evaluation and Encoding (PiCME), which systematically
assesses five clinical data types from MIMIC: discharge summaries, radiology
reports, chest X-rays, demographics, and time-series. We pre-train contrastive
models on all 26 combinations of two to five modalities and evaluate their
utility on in-hospital mortality and phenotype prediction. To address
performance plateaus with more modalities, we introduce a Modality-Gated LSTM
that weights each modality according to its contrastively learned importance.
Our results show that contrastive models remain competitive with supervised
baselines, particularly in three-modality settings. Performance declines beyond
three modalities, which supervised models fail to recover. The Modality-Gated
LSTM mitigates this drop, improving AUROC from 73.19% to 76.93% and AUPRC from
51.27% to 62.26% in the five-modality setting. We also compare contrastively
learned modality importance scores with attribution scores and evaluate
generalization across demographic subgroups, highlighting strengths in
interpretability and fairness. PiCME is the first to scale contrastive learning
across all modality combinations in MIMIC, offering guidance for modality
selection, training strategies, and equitable clinical prediction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于人类视觉发展过程的AI视觉训练方法（DVD），显著提升了AI在形状识别、抗干扰和对抗攻击方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI视觉系统与人类视觉存在显著差异，如过度依赖纹理特征、缺乏形状信息、抗干扰能力弱等，论文旨在通过模拟人类视觉发展过程来解决这些问题。

Method: 通过整合心理物理学和神经生理学研究，设计了一种人类视觉发展模拟训练方法（DVD），指导AI系统逐步学习。

Result: 该方法显著提升了AI在形状识别、抗图像干扰和对抗攻击方面的能力，性能超过传统大规模数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，AI视觉的鲁棒性可以通过优化学习方式而非单纯增加数据量实现，为开发更高效、更安全的AI视觉系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision
persists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than
shape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract
shapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a
solution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than
scaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early
infancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising
decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel
developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems
through this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with
human behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the
strongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape
recognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image
corruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming
high parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data,
we provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way
how a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a
resource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual
systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LaTF的端到端框架，结合表示学习和生成建模，用于学习低维潜在表示并生成跨温度的平衡分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确表征复杂分子系统的平衡分布及其对温度等环境因素的依赖性，对于理解热力学性质和转变机制至关重要。

Method: LaTF框架将状态预测信息瓶颈（SPIB）与归一化流（NFs）结合，共同优化表示学习和生成建模，学习低维潜在变量（CVs）并分类亚稳态。

Result: LaTF在多种系统中表现出色，包括模型势能、Chignolin蛋白和Lennard Jones粒子簇，并能仅用两个温度的数据重建RNA tetraloop系统的温度依赖性结构集合。

Conclusion: LaTF通过联合优化表示学习和生成建模，有效捕捉系统的重要自由度并准确生成平衡分布，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex
molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as
temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and
transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful
low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream
analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as
Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but
their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work,
we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that
tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF
unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to
simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as
Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate
equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two
components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized
jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow,
important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces
the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across
diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and
cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking
using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a
RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two
temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble
and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive
computational results.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential paradigm in artificial
intelligence, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a source task to improve
performance on a target task. This approach, particularly through techniques
such as pretraining and fine-tuning, has seen significant success in fields
like computer vision and natural language processing. However, despite its
widespread use, how to reliably assess the transferability of knowledge remains
a challenge. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of each
transferability metric is critical for ensuring the success of transfer
learning. In this survey, we provide a unified taxonomy of transferability
metrics, categorizing them based on transferable knowledge types and
measurement granularity. This work examines the various metrics developed to
evaluate the potential of source knowledge for transfer learning and their
applicability across different learning paradigms emphasizing the need for
careful selection of these metrics. By offering insights into how different
metrics work under varying conditions, this survey aims to guide researchers
and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate metric for specific
applications, contributing to more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI
systems. Finally, we discuss some open challenges in this field and propose
future research directions to further advance the application of
transferability metrics in trustworthy transfer learning.

*Liangyu Wang,Huanyi Xie,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DistZO2是一个高效、内存优化的分布式零阶微调框架，通过并行策略和硬件感知通信显著提升了训练吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型微调时的内存和计算资源限制问题，尤其是零阶优化在多设备上的扩展性不足。

Method: 引入三种并行策略（PertP、DDP和2D Parallelism）和硬件感知通信策略，优化参数传输和计算重叠。

Result: 在OPT-175B上实现了3倍于ZO2的速度提升，同时保持了内存效率。

Conclusion: DistZO2成功扩展了零阶微调在多GPU系统上的应用，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains resource-intensive due to
their sheer scale. While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a
memory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to
multi-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute
throughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading
model parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with
dual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its
single-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we
present DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed
zeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:
(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed
forward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted
to the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism
design that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication
bottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware
communication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them
across GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. DistZO2 scales
zeroth-order fine-tuning to modern multi-GPU systems, preserving ZO2's memory
efficiency while substantially improving training throughput. In our
experiments on OPT-175B, DistZO2 achieves a 3x speedup over ZO2 with
distributed computing. DistZO2's code has been open-sourced in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出通过神经抑制改进动态路由模型，以提升深度学习的效率、效果和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态路由模型需要根据神经元群体的信号选择架构，但现有方法缺乏对共享信号的抑制，导致路由效果不佳。

Method: 引入神经抑制算法，抑制数据统计中共享的信号，使路由模型能为每个样本选择专家路径。

Result: 实验证明神经抑制算法显著提升通用任务性能。

Conclusion: 神经抑制是实现混合专家、动态路由和Transformer语言模型的有效方法，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: To be effective, efficient, and diverse, deep learning models need to
dynamically choose its architecture based on signals from a population of
neurons. We hypothesize dynamic routing models can be improved with neural
inhibition in those neural populations. This means signals commonly shared
among the various modes of data statistics can be inhibited so that the routing
model can choose a specialized expert path for each data sample. Only through
inhibition is the routing mechanism able to effectively select neural pathways.
We believe this is an under-studied and under-verified implementation
methodology for Mixture-of-Experts, dynamic routing, and transformer language
models. We provide experimental evidence that the neural inhibition algorithm
significantly boosts the performance of general tasks and motivates more effort
to be invested in this research direction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究首次探索了大规模时空动态大气变量的低秩特性，并利用低秩张量模型填补了Sentinel-5P对流层NO2产品中的缺失数据，效果优于传统空间插值方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索动态大气变量的低秩特性，并解决Sentinel-5P产品中因云层遮挡导致的数据缺失问题。

Method: 采用基于CP分解和交替最小二乘法（ALS）的低秩张量模型（LRTM）进行数据填补，并与地统计学空间插值方法进行对比。

Result: 结果表明，LRTM能够有效重构缺失数据，尤其在长时间和大空间尺度下，能够预测异常值和识别热点区域。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了低秩张量模型在动态大气变量填补中的可行性，为类似问题提供了新方法。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate for the first time the low-rank properties of a
tensorized large-scale spatio-temporal dynamic atmospheric variable. We focus
on the Sentinel-5P tropospheric NO2 product (S5P-TN) over a four-year period in
an area that encompasses the contiguous United States (CONUS). Here, it is
demonstrated that a low-rank approximation of such a dynamic variable is
feasible. We apply the low-rank properties of the S5P-TN data to inpaint gaps
in the Sentinel-5P product by adopting a low-rank tensor model (LRTM) based on
the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and alternating least squares (ALS).
Furthermore, we evaluate the LRTM's results by comparing them with spatial
interpolation using geostatistics, and conduct a comprehensive spatial
statistical and temporal analysis of the S5P-TN product. The results of this
study demonstrated that the tensor completion successfully reconstructs the
missing values in the S5P-TN product, particularly in the presence of extended
cloud obscuration, predicting outliers and identifying hotspots, when the data
is tensorized over extended spatial and temporal scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的领域适应方法依赖小批量训练，全局分布建模不足，导致对齐不稳定和泛化性能不佳。

Method: 提出GVI-DA框架，利用变分推断学习连续、类条件全局先验，通过潜在特征重构和全局码本学习减少域差距。

Result: 在四个基准和三十八个任务上表现最优，并分析了先验连续性、码本大小和伪标签噪声容忍度的影响。

Conclusion: GVI-DA在理论和实践上均优于扩散生成框架，具有高效和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based domain adaptation (DA) methods have shown strong
performance by learning transferable representations. However, their reliance
on mini-batch training limits global distribution modeling, leading to unstable
alignment and suboptimal generalization. We propose Global Variational
Inference Enhanced Domain Adaptation (GVI-DA), a framework that learns
continuous, class-conditional global priors via variational inference to enable
structure-aware cross-domain alignment. GVI-DA minimizes domain gaps through
latent feature reconstruction, and mitigates posterior collapse using global
codebook learning with randomized sampling. It further improves robustness by
discarding low-confidence pseudo-labels and generating reliable target-domain
samples. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and thirty-eight DA tasks
demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance. We also derive the model's
evidence lower bound (ELBO) and analyze the effects of prior continuity,
codebook size, and pseudo-label noise tolerance. In addition, we compare GVI-DA
with diffusion-based generative frameworks in terms of optimization principles
and efficiency, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and practical
advantages.

*Guangyan Li,Yongqiang Tang,Wensheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种多粒度自适应参数分配方法（MGAA），用于优化大语言模型的低秩近似压缩，避免均匀压缩导致的性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低秩近似压缩方法通常对所有权重矩阵采用统一压缩比，忽视了其对模型性能的差异化影响，且启发式搜索策略效率低、泛化能力差。

Method: MGAA方法通过子层间余弦相似度和权重矩阵能量分布特征，自适应分配压缩比，无需任务特定评估。

Result: 在多个大语言模型和多模态模型LLaVA上验证了MGAA的优越性能。

Conclusion: MGAA能显著提升压缩效率和模型性能，适用于大语言模型和多模态模型。

Abstract: The enormous parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has made model
compression a research hotspot, which aims to alleviate computational resource
demands during deployment and inference. As a promising direction, low-rank
approximation technique has made remarkable achievements. Nevertheless,
unfortunately, the vast majority of studies to low-rank approximation
compression generally apply uniform compression ratios across all weight
matrices, while disregarding their inherently differentiated impacts on the
model's performance. Although a few recent work attempts to employ heuristic
search strategies to achieve the optimal parameter allocation, such strategies
are computationally inefficient and lose the generalization ability in the era
of LLMs. In this study, we propose a novel parameter Multi-Granular Adaptive
Allocation (MGAA) method, which can adaptively allocate parameters between and
within sublayers without task-specific evaluations in the compression process.
MGAA consists of two components: 1) Among different sublayers, it assigns
compression ratios based on their cosine similarity between inputs and outputs,
allowing for a more tailored compression in sublayers with varying degrees of
importance, and 2) Within each sublayer, it allocates different compression
ratios to weight matrices based on their energy distribution characteristics,
ensuring a consistent energy retention ratio while optimizing compression
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations of MGAA across multiple LLMs backbone
models and benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance.
Additionally, we apply our MGAA to multimodal model LLaVA, exhibiting
remarkable performance improvements.

TL;DR: Dyn-O是一种基于对象中心表示的结构化世界模型，旨在在复杂环境中更好地捕捉动态和增强组合泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对象中心世界模型在视觉复杂度有限的环境中表现良好，但在复杂场景中的泛化能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出Dyn-O模型，改进对象中心表示的学习和动态建模，并分离动态无关和动态相关特征。

Result: 在Procgen游戏中，Dyn-O直接从像素观测中学习对象中心世界模型，预测精度优于DreamerV3。

Conclusion: Dyn-O通过特征解耦实现了更精细的特征操控和多样化的轨迹生成。

Abstract: World models aim to capture the dynamics of the environment, enabling agents
to predict and plan for future states. In most scenarios of interest, the
dynamics are highly centered on interactions among objects within the
environment. This motivates the development of world models that operate on
object-centric rather than monolithic representations, with the goal of more
effectively capturing environment dynamics and enhancing compositional
generalization. However, the development of object-centric world models has
largely been explored in environments with limited visual complexity (such as
basic geometries). It remains underexplored whether such models can generalize
to more complex settings with diverse textures and cluttered scenes. In this
paper, we fill this gap by introducing Dyn-O, an enhanced structured world
model built upon object-centric representations. Compared to prior work in
object-centric representations, Dyn-O improves in both learning representations
and modeling dynamics. On the challenging Procgen games, we find that our
method can learn object-centric world models directly from pixel observations,
outperforming DreamerV3 in rollout prediction accuracy. Furthermore, by
decoupling object-centric features into dynamics-agnostic and dynamics-aware
components, we enable finer-grained manipulation of these features and generate
more diverse imagined trajectories.

Abstract: Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are central to combinatorial optimization
with significant practical implications. Recent advancements in neural
combinatorial optimization (NCO) have demonstrated promising results by
leveraging neural networks to solve VRPs, yet the exploration of model scaling
within this domain remains underexplored. Inspired by the success of model
scaling in large language models (LLMs), this study introduces a Large Routing
Model with 1 billion parameters (LRM-1B), designed to address diverse VRP
scenarios. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LRM-1B across multiple
problem variants, distributions, and sizes, establishing state-of-the-art
results. Our findings reveal that LRM-1B not only adapts to different VRP
challenges but also showcases superior performance, outperforming existing
models. Additionally, we explore the scaling behavior of neural routing models
from 1M to 1B parameters. Our analysis confirms power-law between multiple
model factors and performance, offering critical insights into the optimal
configurations for foundation neural routing solvers.

Result: 实验表明，ReTimeCausal在不规则采样和缺失数据条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTimeCausal填补了现有方法的不足，为复杂时间序列因果发现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a
pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate
science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort
causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to
reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate
shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming
from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal
regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting
real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and
Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with
sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural
constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and
causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data
issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under
challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JAX缺乏对混合精度训练的稳健支持，而混合精度训练已成为提升神经网络训练效率的重要工具。

Method: MPX通过将输入和输出转换为半精度，并引入动态损失缩放机制，解决了半精度计算中的梯度下溢和溢出问题。它还继承了JAX的类型提升行为，确保操作在正确的精度下进行。

Conclusion: MPX为JAX提供了高效的混合精度训练支持，解决了现有工具的不足，并简化了集成过程。

Abstract: Mixed-precision training has emerged as an indispensable tool for enhancing
the efficiency of neural network training in recent years. Concurrently, JAX
has grown in popularity as a versatile machine learning toolbox. However, it
currently lacks robust support for mixed-precision training. We propose MPX, a
mixed-precision training toolbox for JAX that simplifies and accelerates the
training of large-scale neural networks while preserving model accuracy. MPX
seamlessly integrates with popular toolboxes such as Equinox and Flax, allowing
users to convert full-precision pipelines to mixed-precision versions with
minimal modifications. By casting both inputs and outputs to half precision,
and introducing a dynamic loss-scaling mechanism, MPX alleviates issues like
gradient underflow and overflow that commonly arise in half precision
computations. Its design inherits critical features from JAX's type-promotion
behavior, ensuring that operations take place in the correct precision and
allowing for selective enforcement of full precision where needed (e.g., sums,
means, or softmax). MPX further provides wrappers for automatic creation and
management of mixed-precision gradients and optimizers, enabling
straightforward integration into existing JAX training pipelines. MPX's source

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly
applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify
substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end
explainable machine learning models for structure-activity relationship (SAR)
modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as
limited activity data per target and the sensitivity of properties to subtle
molecular changes. To address this, we leveraged activity-cliff molecule pairs,
i.e., compounds sharing a common scaffold but differing sharply in potency,
targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (i.e., PDB
IDs 1O42, 2H8H, and 4MXO). We implemented graph neural network (GNN) methods to
obtain atom-level feature information and predict compound-protein affinity
(i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). In addition, we trained
GNN models with different structure-aware loss functions to adequately leverage
molecular property and structure information. We also utilized group lasso and
sparse group lasso to prune and highlight molecular subgraphs and enhance the
structure-specific model explainability for the predicted property difference
in molecular activity-cliff pairs. We improved drug property prediction by
integrating common and uncommon node information and using sparse group lasso,
reducing the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 12.70%, and achieving
the lowest averaged RMSE=0.2551 and the highest PCC=0.9572. Furthermore,
applying regularization enhances feature attribution methods that estimate the
contribution of each atom in the molecular graphs by boosting global direction
scores and atom-level accuracy in atom coloring accuracy, which improves model
interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly in investigating
important molecular substructures in lead optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in sequential
decision tasks. However, recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of RL
policies to different perturbations, raising concerns about their effectiveness
and safety in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on the robustness
of RL policies against action perturbations and introduce a novel framework
called Optimal Adversary-aware Policy Iteration (OA-PI). Our framework enhances
action robustness under various perturbations by evaluating and improving
policy performance against the corresponding optimal adversaries. Besides, our
approach can be integrated into mainstream DRL algorithms such as Twin Delayed
DDPG (TD3) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), improving action robustness
effectively while maintaining nominal performance and sample efficiency.
Experimental results across various environments demonstrate that our method
enhances robustness of DRL policies against different action adversaries
effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在不同领域的应用导致评估方法多样，难以有效比较模型性能。绝对评估指标提供了一种固定尺度的评估方法，但缺乏全面指导。

Method: 通过按学习问题类型组织绝对评估指标，涵盖分类、聚类、回归和排序等任务，提供综合概述。

Result: 论文为实践者提供了选择合适评估指标的工具，改进了模型评估并促进了跨模型和应用的比较。

Conclusion: 该综述填补了绝对评估指标使用指南的空白，帮助实践者更有效地评估和比较模型。

Abstract: Machine Learning is a diverse field applied across various domains such as
computer science, social sciences, medicine, chemistry, and finance. This
diversity results in varied evaluation approaches, making it difficult to
compare models effectively. Absolute evaluation measures offer a practical
solution by assessing a model's performance on a fixed scale, independent of
reference models and data ranges, enabling explicit comparisons. However, many
commonly used measures are not universally applicable, leading to a lack of
comprehensive guidance on their appropriate use. This survey addresses this gap
by providing an overview of absolute evaluation metrics in ML, organized by the
type of learning problem. While classification metrics have been extensively
studied, this work also covers clustering, regression, and ranking metrics. By
grouping these measures according to the specific ML challenges they address,
this survey aims to equip practitioners with the tools necessary to select
appropriate metrics for their models. The provided overview thus improves
individual model evaluation and facilitates meaningful comparisons across
different models and applications.

Motivation: 研究$z$-变换在序列分析中的潜力，特别是在推导渐近结果时的作用。

Method: 通过$z$-变换方法，从最简单的梯度下降迭代开始，逐步扩展到Nesterov加速、平均技术和随机梯度下降。

Result: 证明了$z$-变换方法在分析收敛行为和渐近结果中的有效性。

Conclusion: $z$-变换是一种强大的工具，适用于多种优化算法的渐近分析。

Abstract: The $z$-transform of a sequence is a classical tool used within signal
processing, control theory, computer science, and electrical engineering. It
allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many
operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its
$z$-transform. In particular, the $z$-transform method focuses on asymptotic
behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of
results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and
optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the
$z$-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the
simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space,
we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We
then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and
stochastic gradient descent.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is essential in drug discovery and
related fields. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle
to simultaneously capture both local and global molecular structures. In this
work, we propose a Multi-Level Fusion Graph Neural Network (MLFGNN) that
integrates Graph Attention Networks and a novel Graph Transformer to jointly
model local and global dependencies. In addition, we incorporate molecular
fingerprints as a complementary modality and introduce a mechanism of
interaction between attention to adaptively fuse information across
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MLFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both classification and regression tasks. Interpretability analysis further
reveals that the model effectively captures task-relevant chemical patterns,
supporting the usefulness of multi-level and multi-modal fusion in molecular
representation learning.

Conclusion: 结合形状信息的混合方法可增强分子表示，为分子机器学习任务提供新思路。

Abstract: The shape of a molecule determines its physicochemical and biological
properties. However, it is often underrepresented in standard molecular
representation learning approaches. Here, we propose using the Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor.
Computed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic
features, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features,
offering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature
space. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine
benchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition
constant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation
against traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular
fingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show
that our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking
among the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its
combination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON
fingerprint, significantly \emph{enhances predictive performance},
outperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the
complementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for
being combined with established techniques. Our study suggests that hybrid
approaches incorporating explicit shape information can lead to more
informative and robust molecular representations, enhancing and opening new
avenues in molecular machine learning tasks. To support reproducibility and
foster open biomedical research, we provide open access to all experiments and
code used in this work.

Abstract: ObjectRL is an open-source Python codebase for deep reinforcement learning
(RL), designed for research-oriented prototyping with minimal programming
effort. Unlike existing codebases, ObjectRL is built on Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) principles, providing a clear structure that simplifies the
implementation, modification, and evaluation of new algorithms. ObjectRL lowers
the entry barrier for deep RL research by organizing best practices into
explicit, clearly separated components, making them easier to understand and
adapt. Each algorithmic component is a class with attributes that describe key
RL concepts and methods that intuitively reflect their interactions. The class
hierarchy closely follows common ontological relationships, enabling data
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are core features of OOP.
We demonstrate the efficiency of ObjectRL's design through representative use
cases that highlight its flexibility and suitability for rapid prototyping. The

Result: 实验表明MAFG能有效自动化特征生成并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: MAFG为科学数据特征生成提供了高效自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Feature generation (FG) aims to enhance the prediction potential of original
data by constructing high-order feature combinations and removing redundant
features. It is a key preprocessing step for tabular scientific data to improve
downstream machine-learning model performance. Traditional methods face the
following two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific
data: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in
scientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise.
Secondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space
expands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption.
Advancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have
opened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by
that, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and
proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in
the iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical
transformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature
combinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement
learning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration
phase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively
evaluate the generated features of each significant model performance
breakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate
that the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process
and significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks.

Motivation: 传统方法对所有网络层使用统一学习率，可能忽略各部分的独特动态，RLRS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入相对学习率（RLRS），针对不同组件调整学习率，超参数可从小模型高效调参并迁移到大模型。

Result: RLRS在复杂模型（如MoE）中训练速度提升高达23%，且适用于规模扩大27倍的模型。

Conclusion: RLRS是一种简单有效的优化方法，显著减少训练时间和计算资源，适用于大规模神经网络。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach for optimizing LLM training by
adjusting learning rates across weights of different components in Transformer
models. Traditional methods often apply a uniform learning rate across all
network layers, potentially overlooking the unique dynamics of each part.
Remarkably, our introduced relative learning rates, RLRS, method accelerates
the training process by up to $23\%$, particularly in complex models such as
Mixture of Experts (MoE). Hyperparameters of RLRS can be efficiently tuned on
smaller models and then effectively reused on models up to $27\times$ larger.
This simple and effective method results in a substantial reduction in training
time and computational resources, offering a practical and scalable solution
for optimizing large-scale neural networks.

Result: 实验证明该框架能构建具有复杂表间依赖关系的数据集，模拟真实场景。

Conclusion: 该框架为生成真实的关系型表格数据提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has received increasing attention in recent
years, particularly with the emergence of foundation models for tabular data.
The breakthrough success of TabPFN (Hollmann et al.,2025), which leverages vast
quantities of synthetic tabular datasets derived from structural causal models
(SCMs), demonstrates the critical role synthetic data plays in developing
powerful tabular foundation models. However, most real-world tabular data
exists in relational formats spanning multiple interconnected tables - a
structure not adequately addressed by current generation methods. In this work,
we extend the SCM-based approach by developing a novel framework that generates
realistic synthetic relational tabular data including causal relationships
across tables. Our experiments confirm that this framework is able to construct
relational datasets with complex inter-table dependencies mimicking real-world
scenarios.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中差分隐私带来的高维梯度传输和噪声放大的问题。

Method: 使用紧凑草图将梯度投影到低维空间，并引入随机探测防止草图退化。

Result: 通信成本从d降到k，梯度近似误差为σ²k，满足(ε,δ)-差分隐私。

Conclusion: DOME框架有效降低了联邦学习中差分隐私的通信和噪声成本。

Abstract: Federated learning with differential privacy suffers from two major costs:
each client must transmit $d$-dimensional gradients every round, and the
magnitude of DP noise grows with $d$. Yet empirical studies show that gradient
updates exhibit strong temporal correlations and lie in a $k$-dimensional
subspace with $k \ll d$. Motivated by this, we introduce DOME, a decentralized
DP optimization framework in which each client maintains a compact sketch to
project gradients into $\mathbb{R}^k$ before privatization and Secure
Aggregation. This reduces per-round communication from order $d$ to order $k$
and moves towards a gradient approximation mean-squared error of $\sigma^2 k$.
To allow the sketch to span new directions and prevent it from collapsing onto
historical gradients, we augment it with random probes orthogonal to historical
directions. We prove that our overall protocol satisfies
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy.

Motivation: 现有的图神经正切核（GNTK）存在冗余计算和计算复杂度高的问题，限制了实际应用的可扩展性。

Conclusion: SGTK和SGNK通过简化计算流程，显著提升了效率，同时保持了模型的表达能力。

Abstract: The Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) successfully bridges the gap between
kernel methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), addressing key challenges such
as the difficulty of training deep networks and the limitations of traditional
kernel methods. However, the existing layer-stacking strategy in GNTK
introduces redundant computations, significantly increasing computational
complexity and limiting scalability for practical applications. To address
these issues, this paper proposes the Simplified Graph Neural Tangent Kernel
(SGTK), which replaces the traditional multi-layer stacking mechanism with a
continuous $K$-step aggregation operation. This novel approach streamlines the
iterative kernel computation process, effectively eliminating redundant
calculations while preserving the kernel's expressiveness. By reducing the
dependency on layer stacking, SGTK achieves both computational simplicity and
efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce the Simplified Graph Neural Kernel
(SGNK), which models infinitely wide Graph Neural Networks as Gaussian
Processes. This allows kernel values to be directly determined from the
expected outputs of activation functions in the infinite-width regime,
bypassing the need for explicit layer-by-layer computation. SGNK further
reduces computational complexity while maintaining the capacity to capture
intricate structural patterns in graphs. Extensive experiments on node and
graph classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed SGTK and SGNK achieve
performance comparable to existing approaches while improving computational
efficiency. Implementation details are available at

Conclusion: KLDM通过创新的坐标建模方法，成功解决了晶体材料生成中的对称性问题，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Generative modeling of crystalline materials using diffusion models presents
a series of challenges: the data distribution is characterized by inherent
symmetries and involves multiple modalities, with some defined on specific
manifolds. Notably, the treatment of fractional coordinates representing atomic
positions in the unit cell requires careful consideration, as they lie on a
hypertorus. In this work, we introduce Kinetic Langevin Diffusion for Materials
(KLDM), a novel diffusion model for crystalline materials generation, where the
key innovation resides in the modeling of the coordinates. Instead of resorting
to Riemannian diffusion on the hypertorus directly, we generalize Trivialized
Diffusion Model (TDM) to account for the symmetries inherent to crystals. By
coupling coordinates with auxiliary Euclidean variables representing
velocities, the diffusion process is now offset to a flat space. This allows us
to effectively perform diffusion on the hypertorus while providing a training
objective that accounts for the periodic translation symmetry of the true data
distribution. We evaluate KLDM on both Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and
De-novo Generation (DNG) tasks, demonstrating its competitive performance with
current state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: PEM-UDE为构建多尺度脑模型提供了新途径，连接了单神经元动态与宏观脑活动。

Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains
a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the
PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal
differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from
chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This
approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization
landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process
without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by
recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from
noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of
the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is
corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that
this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct
symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount
of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method
derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as
network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing
yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving
microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent
relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and
synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three
intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex,
prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to
develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse
neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and
macroscale brain activity.

Abstract: Inconsistencies between clinical and omics data may arise within medical
cohorts. The identification, annotation and explanation of anomalous
omics-based patients or individuals may become crucial to better reshape the
disease, e.g., by detecting early onsets signaled by the omics and undetectable
from observable symptoms. Here, we developed MLASDO (Machine Learning based
Anomalous Sample Detection on Omics), a new method and software tool to
identify, characterize and automatically describe anomalous samples based on
omics data. Its workflow is based on three steps: (1) classification of healthy
and cases individuals using a support vector machine algorithm; (2) detection
of anomalous samples within groups; (3) explanation of anomalous individuals
based on clinical data and expert knowledge. We showcase MLASDO using
transcriptomics data of 317 healthy controls (HC) and 465 Parkinson's disease
(PD) cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In this cohort,
MLASDO detected 15 anomalous HC with a PD-like transcriptomic signature and
PD-like clinical features, including a lower proportion of CD4/CD8 naive
T-cells and CD4 memory T-cells compared to HC (P<3.5*10^-3). MLASDO also
identified 22 anomalous PD cases with a transcriptomic signature more similar
to that of HC and some clinical features more similar to HC, including a lower
proportion of mature neutrophils compared to PD cases (P<6*10^-3). In summary,
MLASDO is a powerful tool that can help the clinician to detect and explain
anomalous HC and cases of interest to be followed up. MLASDO is an open-source

Abstract: Scientific applications increasingly demand real-time surrogate models that
can capture the behavior of strongly coupled multiphysics systems driven by
multiple input functions, such as in thermo-mechanical and electro-thermal
processes. While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their
extension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,
the challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled
physical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses
a foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator
reflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we
present the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet
variants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly
coupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with
dual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional
coupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic
thermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient
phase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical
DeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked
using both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our
results demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is
crucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch
counterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer
advantages for decoupled or single-physics problems. Once trained, these
surrogates achieve full-field predictions up to 1.8e4 times faster than
high-fidelity finite-element solvers, without compromising solution accuracy.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on code
with security vulnerabilities can result in misaligned and unsafe behaviors
across broad domains. These results prompted concerns about the emergence of
harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we
contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts
the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series
of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient
vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space
dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be
better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning
on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we
identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs
alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and
by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can
degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.
Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed
misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The
results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that
preserve intended behavior across domains.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了多种图神经网络（GNN）架构在电力消耗预测中的表现，发现简单模型如GCN和APPNP在低数据或高度分散场景下表现优异，而GAT在解释性方面具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力消耗预测对电网稳定和发电优化至关重要，但传统方法难以捕捉空间依赖性，GNN提供了解决这一问题的框架。

Method: 评估了多种GNN架构（如GCN、GraphSAGE、GAT等）在法国和英国的实际电力消耗数据集上的表现，并分析了注意力机制的时空模式。

Result: 复杂架构（如GATv2）并未始终优于简单模型，GCN和APPNP在特定场景下表现良好，GAT在解释性上具有竞争力。注意力机制揭示了区域互动的季节性变化。

Conclusion: 尽管注意力机制并非普遍最优，但在空间依赖性显著时具有解释优势。集成策略能提升模型鲁棒性，优于单一模型。

Abstract: Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is crucial for ensuring grid
stability and optimizing power generation, particularly in increasingly
decentralized and complex systems. While classical approaches such as
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to
capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by
directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of
GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP,
TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two
real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our
experiments show that while complex architectures like GATv2 and
TransformerConv do not consistently outperform their simpler counterparts,
models such as GCN and APPNP achieve strong results in low-data or highly
disaggregated settings. Nonetheless, the vanilla GAT remains highly competitive
across both datasets and offers an additional interpretability layer via
attention mechanisms. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights,
revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and
meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is
not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial
dependencies are prominent. Finally, we benchmark ensemble-based expert
aggregation strategies, showing that uniform or learned combinations can
enhance robustness and outperform individual models under data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: CosmoBench为宇宙学和几何深度学习的结合提供了平台，鼓励社区利用该数据集推动科学发现。

Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds
and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that
shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we
introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art
cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours
and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of
its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter
halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand
directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time
scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict
cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the
velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,
and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time
scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established
approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.
For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that
are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more
computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural
networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features
sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far
longer training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve
these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit
the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep
learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific
discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFA工具虽然准确，但需要大量人力和时间，限制了其广泛应用。研究旨在通过AI技术解决这一问题。

Method: 使用LLMs对600个初创企业融资演讲进行CFA因素评分，并以此训练机器学习分类模型。

Result: 最佳模型预测准确率达85.0%，与传统人工评估显著相关（Spearman's r = 0.896）。

Conclusion: AI与CFA框架结合，提供了一种可扩展、可靠且减少偏见的初创企业评估方法。

Abstract: External funding is crucial for early-stage ventures, particularly technology
startups that require significant R&D investment. Business angels offer a
critical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and
resource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has
investigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels
consider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more
than 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated
post-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own
decisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals
and several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work
validating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its
adoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we
prompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors
to a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business
angel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated
machine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as
input features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy
(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant
correlation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional
human-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a
structured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable,
reliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the
constraints that previously limited adoption.

TL;DR: FAROS是一种新颖的公平图生成框架，通过在预训练的图扩散模型生成过程中直接切换节点敏感属性，实现公平性，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过重新训练模型引入公平性约束，效率较低。FAROS旨在直接在生成过程中优化公平性，避免重新训练。

Method: FAROS通过计算最优切换节点比例，并在特定扩散步骤中切换敏感属性，结合多标准约束保持节点拓扑分布和边独立性。

Result: 实验表明，FAROS在减少公平性差距的同时，保持了与基线相当的准确性，甚至在某些情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: FAROS通过多标准约束在公平性和准确性之间取得了更好的平衡，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph diffusion models (GDMs) have enabled the
synthesis of realistic network structures, yet ensuring fairness in the
generated data remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions attempt to
mitigate bias by re-training the GDMs with ad-hoc fairness constraints.
Conversely, with this work, we propose FAROS, a novel FAir graph geneRatiOn
framework leveraging attribute Switching mechanisms and directly running in the
generation process of the pre-trained GDM. Technically, our approach works by
altering nodes' sensitive attributes during the generation. To this end, FAROS
calculates the optimal fraction of switching nodes, and selects the diffusion
step to perform the switch by setting tailored multi-criteria constraints to
preserve the node-topology profile from the original distribution (a proxy for
accuracy) while ensuring the edge independence on the sensitive attributes for
the generated graph (a proxy for fairness). Our experiments on benchmark
datasets for link prediction demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively
reduces fairness discrepancies while maintaining comparable (or even higher)
accuracy performance to other similar baselines. Noteworthy, FAROS is also able
to strike a better accuracy-fairness trade-off than other competitors in some
of the tested settings under the Pareto optimality concept, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the imposed multi-criteria constraints.

Motivation: VLSI设计流程中，时序分析依赖于布局和布线，而布局和布线的效率又受时序性能影响，因此需要更高效的时序相关预测方法。

Method: 采用GNN技术建模后布局有效电容，利用GPU并行化实现速度提升。

Result: GNN-Ceff在真实基准测试中比现有方法快929倍，且准确性更高。

Conclusion: GNN-Ceff为VLSI设计流程提供了更高效和准确的时序分析工具。

Abstract: Static timing analysis is a crucial stage in the VLSI design flow that
verifies the timing correctness of circuits. Timing analysis depends on the
placement and routing of the design, but at the same time, placement and
routing efficiency depend on the final timing performance. VLSI design flows
can benefit from timing-related prediction to better perform the earlier stages
of the design flow. Effective capacitance is an essential input for gate delay
calculation, and finding exact values requires routing or routing estimates. In
this work, we propose the first GNN-based post-layout effective capacitance
modeling method, GNN-Ceff, that achieves significant speed gains due to GPU
parallelization while also providing better accuracy than current heuristics.
GNN-Ceff parallelization achieves 929x speedup on real-life benchmarks over the
state-of-the-art method run serially.

Motivation: 传统迭代方法在计算矩阵函数时需要手动调参，设计复杂且耗时，尤其在多样化计算环境中难以实现最优性能。

Result: MatRL生成的算法在实验中表现优于文献中的多种基线方法，并能推广到相同分布的大规模矩阵。

Conclusion: MatRL为矩阵函数计算提供了一种自动化、高效的算法设计方法，具有理论和实验验证的优势。

Abstract: Iterative methods for computing matrix functions have been extensively
studied and their convergence speed can be significantly improved with the
right tuning of parameters and by mixing different iteration types. Handtuning
the design options for optimal performance can be cumbersome, especially in
modern computing environments: numerous different classical iterations and
their variants exist, each with non-trivial per-step cost and tuning
parameters. To this end, we propose MatRL -- a reinforcement learning based
framework that automatically discovers iterative algorithms for computing
matrix functions. The key idea is to treat algorithm design as a sequential
decision-making process. Monte-Carlo tree search is then used to plan a hybrid
sequence of matrix iterations and step sizes, tailored to a specific input
matrix distribution and computing environment. Moreover, we also show that the
learned algorithms provably generalize to sufficiently large matrices drawn
from the same distribution. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical results
with numerical experiments demonstrating that MatRL produces algorithms that
outperform various baselines in the literature.

Result: 在Alps超级计算机上，实现了128 GPU的强扩展和512 GPU的弱扩展（87%并行效率）。

Conclusion: 分布式eGNN为大规模材料电子结构预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (eGNNs) trained on density-functional
theory (DFT) data can potentially perform electronic structure prediction at
unprecedented scales, enabling investigation of the electronic properties of
materials with extended defects, interfaces, or exhibiting disordered phases.
However, as interactions between atomic orbitals typically extend over 10+
angstroms, the graph representations required for this task tend to be densely
connected, and the memory requirements to perform training and inference on
these large structures can exceed the limits of modern GPUs. Here we present a
distributed eGNN implementation which leverages direct GPU communication and
introduce a partitioning strategy of the input graph to reduce the number of
embedding exchanges between GPUs. Our implementation shows strong scaling up to
128 GPUs, and weak scaling up to 512 GPUs with 87% parallel efficiency for
structures with 3,000 to 190,000 atoms on the Alps supercomputer.

Conclusion: OrbitAll通过物理信息架构实现了对复杂分子系统的高效准确表示，显著提升了量子化学深度学习的适用性。

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning methods in quantum chemistry, their
representational capacity is most often confined to neutral, closed-shell
molecules. However, real-world chemical systems often exhibit complex
characteristics, including varying charges, spins, and environments. We
introduce OrbitAll, a geometry- and physics-informed deep learning framework
that can represent all molecular systems with electronic structure information.
OrbitAll utilizes spin-polarized orbital features from the underlying quantum
mechanical method, and combines it with graph neural networks satisfying
SE(3)-equivariance. The resulting framework can represent and process any
molecular system with arbitrary charges, spins, and environmental effects.
OrbitAll demonstrates superior performance and generalization on predicting
charged, open-shell, and solvated molecules, while also robustly extrapolating
to molecules significantly larger than the training data by leveraging a
physics-informed architecture. OrbitAll achieves chemical accuracy using 10
times fewer training data than competing AI models, with a speedup of
approximately $10^3$ - $10^4$ compared to density functional theory.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合符号和神经网络技术，显著提升了ODE求解的精度和实用性。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning neural network models for Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) with parametric uncertainties. Such neural
network models capture the solution to the ODE over a given set of parameters,
initial conditions, and range of times. Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning such models that
combine data-driven deep learning with symbolic physics models in a principled
manner. However, the accuracy of PINNs degrade when they are used to solve an
entire family of initial value problems characterized by varying parameters and
initial conditions.
  In this paper, we combine symbolic differentiation and Taylor series methods
to propose a class of higher-order models for capturing the solutions to ODEs.
These models combine neural networks and symbolic terms: they use higher order
Lie derivatives and a Taylor series expansion obtained symbolically, with the
remainder term modeled as a neural network. The key insight is that the
remainder term can itself be modeled as a solution to a first-order ODE. We
show how the use of these higher order PINNs can improve accuracy using
interesting, but challenging ODE benchmarks. We also show that the resulting
model can be quite useful for situations such as controlling uncertain physical
systems modeled as ODEs.

Conclusion: 集成方法在多种物理系统中表现出高效性和准确性，可作为传统求解器的替代方案。

Abstract: Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require
computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field
evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions,
autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over
successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep
ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate
models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and
aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model
predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive
strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We
validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution
in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and
planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in
error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the
method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory
predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers.
Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical
systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to
traditional solvers. The codes for this work are available on GitHub

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to support health behavior
change via personalized and just-in-time adaptive interventions is of
significant interest to health and behavioral science researchers focused on
problems such as smoking cessation support and physical activity promotion.
However, RL methods are often applied to these domains using a small collection
of context variables to mitigate the significant data scarcity issues that
arise from practical limitations on the design of adaptive intervention trials.
In this paper, we explore an approach to significantly expanding the state
space of an adaptive intervention without impacting data efficiency. The
proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide natural language
descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages inference
with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy of a
base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we
develop a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that
generates text-based state descriptions conditioned on latent state variables
using an auxiliary LLM. We show that this approach has the potential to
significantly improve the performance of online policy learning methods.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure
that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is
critical for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the
disease. In this study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage
of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a
sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also
rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long
short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess
their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data
imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit
history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model
optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance
despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly
in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe
disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal
prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early
diagnosis and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Multimodal representation is faithful and highly effective in describing
real-world data samples' characteristics by describing their complementary
information. However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and
misaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor
frequencies and device malfunctions. Existing research has not effectively
addressed the issue of filling missing data in scenarios where multiview data
are both imbalanced and misaligned. Instead, it relies on class-level alignment
of the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being
well-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we
propose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment
Clustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the
problem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets.
Specifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM),
which employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to
identify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal
data. Subsequently, based on noise-contrastive learning, we design a
consistency-aware padding module (CAPM) to effectively interpolate and align
imbalanced and misaligned data, thereby improving the quality of multimodal
data fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method
over benchmark datasets. The code will be publicly released at

Motivation: 传统方法基于特征向量转换化学化合物，学习性能受限；GNN可直接利用化学图，性能更优。

Method: 结合MILP和GNN，开发mol-infer-GNN框架，保持化学图抽象结构的灵活性。

Result: 在QM9数据集上，GNN模型对某些性质表现良好，可推断含20个非氢原子的小化学图。

Conclusion: mol-infer-GNN框架在提升学习性能和推断效率方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Recently, a novel two-phase framework named mol-infer for inference of
chemical compounds with prescribed abstract structures and desired property
values has been proposed. The framework mol-infer is primarily based on using
mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to simulate the computational process
of machine learning methods and describe the necessary and sufficient
conditions to ensure such a chemical graph exists. The existing approaches
usually first convert the chemical compounds into handcrafted feature vectors
to construct prediction functions, but because of the limit on the kinds of
descriptors originated from the need for tractability in the MILP formulation,
the learning performances on datasets of some properties are not good enough. A
lack of good learning performance can greatly lower the quality of the inferred
chemical graphs, and thus improving learning performance is of great
importance. On the other hand, graph neural networks (GNN) offer a promising
machine learning method to directly utilize the chemical graphs as the input,
and many existing GNN-based approaches to the molecular property prediction
problem have shown that they can enjoy better learning performances compared to
the traditional approaches that are based on feature vectors. In this study, we
develop a molecular inference framework based on mol-infer, namely
mol-infer-GNN, that utilizes GNN as the learning method while keeping the great
flexibility originated from the two-layered model on the abstract structure of
the chemical graph to be inferred. We conducted computational experiments on
the QM9 dataset to show that our proposed GNN model can obtain satisfying
learning performances for some properties despite its simple structure, and can
infer small chemical graphs comprising up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms within
reasonable computational time.

*Mohamed Hamad,Mohamed Mabrok,Nizar Zorba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多通道时空（MCST）Mamba模型，用于同时预测交通数据中的多个变量，解决了现有方法无法捕捉跨通道联合模式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通预测在智能交通系统中至关重要，但现有方法难以处理动态路况、多变交通模式及外部因素（如天气和事故）的影响，且通常只能预测单一变量或需为每个变量单独建模。

Method: 基于Mamba选择性状态空间架构，提出MCST-Mamba模型，整合自适应时空嵌入，并分离时空建模为两个专用Mamba块。

Result: MCST-Mamba在所有交通特征上表现出色，参数数量少于基线模型。

Conclusion: MCST-Mamba能有效捕捉跨通道联合模式，提升交通预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction plays a vital role in intelligent transportation
systems by enabling efficient routing, congestion mitigation, and proactive
traffic control. However, forecasting is challenging due to the combined
effects of dynamic road conditions, varying traffic patterns across different
locations, and external influences such as weather and accidents. Traffic data
often consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and
occupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these
variables or require a separate model for each. This limits their ability to
capture joint patterns across channels. To address this, we introduce the
Multi-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built
on the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles
multivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The
proposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and
separates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions
into two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike
prior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across
all traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises
in practice. Our results show that MCST-Mamba achieves strong predictive
performance with a lower parameter count compared to baseline models.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，GCAT表现优于规则方法，并与现有神经网络模型竞争或超越。

Conclusion: 基于注意力的架构在捕捉复杂关系模式方面具有优势，适用于知识图谱补全任务。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs offer a structured representation of real-world entities and
their relationships, enabling a wide range of applications from information
retrieval to automated reasoning. In this paper, we conduct a systematic
comparison between traditional rule-based approaches and modern deep learning
methods for link prediction. We focus on KBGAT, a graph neural network model
that leverages multi-head attention to jointly encode both entity and relation
features within local neighborhood structures. To advance this line of
research, we introduce \textbf{GCAT} (Graph Collaborative Attention Network), a
refined model that enhances context aggregation and interaction between
heterogeneous nodes. Experimental results on four widely-used benchmark
datasets demonstrate that GCAT not only consistently outperforms rule-based
methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
existing neural embedding models. Our findings highlight the advantages of
attention-based architectures in capturing complex relational patterns for
knowledge graph completion tasks.

Motivation: 实验室传感器异常检测需要快速适应新液体或传感器，传统方法可能耗时且复杂。

Method: 使用定制PCB捕获传感器数据，通过基于注意力的单类自动编码器进行训练，仅需30分钟正常数据即可达到可用状态。

Result: 模型在合成微异常测试中达到F1分数0.72、精度0.89和召回率0.61，最终生成31 kB的TensorFlow-Lite二进制文件，边缘设备推理延迟低于2秒。

Conclusion: 该管道可在1小时内完成从收集到部署的整个工作流程，快速适应新环境。

Abstract: A lightweight, edge-deployable pipeline is proposed for detecting sensor
anomalies in chemistry and biology laboratories. A custom PCB captures seven
sensor channels and streams them over the local network. An Attention-based
One-Class Autoencoder reaches a usable state after training on only thirty
minutes of normal data. Despite the small data set, the model already attains
an F1 score of 0.72, a precision of 0.89, and a recall of 0.61 when tested on
synthetic micro-anomalies. The trained network is converted into a
TensorFlow-Lite binary of about 31 kB and runs on an Advantech ARK-1221L, a
fan-less x86 edge device without AVX instructions; end-to-end inference latency
stays below two seconds. The entire collect-train-deploy workflow finishes
within one hour, which demonstrates that the pipeline adapts quickly whenever a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Transformer位置嵌入方法无法充分捕捉源代码的层次结构（如AST），因此需要一种新的嵌入方法。

Method: 提出了一种树基位置嵌入方法，编码AST的层次关系（如节点深度和兄弟索引），并将其集成到CodeBERTa模型中。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的Tree-Enhanced CodeBERTa在MLM预训练和克隆检测任务中表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 显式引入源代码的结构信息能显著提升Transformer模型的性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated significant success in various
source code representation tasks. Nonetheless, traditional positional
embeddings employed by these models inadequately capture the hierarchical
structure intrinsic to source code, typically represented as Abstract Syntax
Trees (ASTs). To address this, we propose a novel tree-based positional
embedding approach that explicitly encodes hierarchical relationships derived
from ASTs, including node depth and sibling indices. These hierarchical
embeddings are integrated into the transformer architecture, specifically
enhancing the CodeBERTa model. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed model
through masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining and clone detection
fine-tuning tasks. Experimental results indicate that our Tree-Enhanced
CodeBERTa consistently surpasses the baseline model in terms of loss, accuracy,
F1 score, precision, and recall, emphasizing the importance of incorporating
explicit structural information into transformer-based representations of
source code.

Conclusion: 研究为城市建模提供了网络效应整合方法，对政策制定和规划具有指导意义。

Abstract: Urban socioeconomic modeling has predominantly concentrated on extensive
location and neighborhood-based features, relying on the localized population
footprint. However, networks in urban systems are common, and many urban
modeling methods don't account for network-based effects. In this study, we
propose using commute information records from the census as a reliable and
comprehensive source to construct mobility networks across cities. Leveraging
deep learning architectures, we employ these commute networks across U.S. metro
areas for socioeconomic modeling. We show that mobility network structures
provide significant predictive performance without considering any node
features. Consequently, we use mobility networks to present a supervised
learning framework to model a city's socioeconomic indicator directly,
combining Graph Neural Network and Vanilla Neural Network models to learn all
parameters in a single learning pipeline. Our experiments in 12 major U.S.
cities show the proposed model outperforms previous conventional machine
learning models. This work provides urban researchers methods to incorporate
network effects in urban modeling and informs stakeholders of wider
network-based effects in urban policymaking and planning.

Result: MLR模型表现最佳（R2 = 0.86-0.87），并用于10年期的温度预测，结果显示了明显的季节性温度变化及表土温度的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究提供了实用的方程，可用于SAT操作的实时监测和长期规划。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of effluent temperature in recharge basins is essential
for optimizing the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) process, as temperature
directly influences water viscosity and infiltration rates. This study develops
and evaluates predictive models for effluent temperature in the upper recharge
layer of a Shafdan SAT system recharge basin using ambient meteorological data.
Multiple linear regression (MLR), neural networks (NN), and random forests (RF)
were tested for their predictive accuracy and interpretability. The MLR model,
preferred for its operational simplicity and robust performance, achieved high
predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.86-0.87) and was used to estimate effluent
temperatures over a 10-year period. Results highlight pronounced seasonal
temperature cycles and the importance of topsoil temperature in governing the
thermal profile of the infiltrating effluent. The study provides practical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dreamer算法的潜在空间压缩可能导致关键信息丢失，影响智能体性能。现有方法（如Δ-IRIS和DIAMOND）需从像素直接训练，效率低且无法利用世界模型学习的内在表示。

Method: 提出EMERALD，使用空间潜在状态和MaskGIT预测生成准确的潜在空间轨迹，提升智能体性能。

Result: 在Crafter基准测试中，EMERALD首次在10M环境步数内超越人类专家表现，并解锁全部22项成就。

Conclusion: EMERALD是一种高效且准确的世界建模方法，显著提升了智能体性能。

Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across
diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated
trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space
can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's
performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this
limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods
require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency
and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned
by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world
modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient
MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent
state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent
space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD
achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass
human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also
succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.

Result: 结果表明不同注意力层由其假设的输入数据关系所表征。

Conclusion: 结论是注意力机制的关系归纳偏差可以通过几何方法分类，并揭示了其底层假设。

Abstract: Inductive learning aims to construct general models from specific examples,
guided by biases that influence hypothesis selection and determine
generalization capacity. In this work, we focus on characterizing the
relational inductive biases present in attention mechanisms, understood as
assumptions about the underlying relationships between data elements. From the
perspective of geometric deep learning, we analyze the most common attention
mechanisms in terms of their equivariance properties with respect to
permutation subgroups, which allows us to propose a classification based on
their relational biases. Under this perspective, we show that different
attention layers are characterized by the underlying relationships they assume
on the input data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了数据无关知识蒸馏（DFKD）中非可迁移学习（NTL）教师的影响，并提出了一种名为Adversarial Trap Escaping（ATEsc）的方法来过滤误导性样本，提升DFKD效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DFKD方法通常假设教师模型可信，但忽略了来自不可信教师的鲁棒性和安全性问题。本文首次探讨了在NTL教师下DFKD的表现，发现其会误导生成器关注OOD知识而非ID知识。

Method: 提出ATEsc方法，通过分析样本的对抗鲁棒性将其分为ID-like和OOD-like两组，分别用于知识蒸馏和遗忘OOD知识。

Result: 实验证明ATEsc能有效提升DFKD在NTL教师下的表现。

Conclusion: ATEsc为解决DFKD中NTL教师带来的问题提供了一种有效方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to
a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common
solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a
substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers
are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted
teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation
into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the
transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is
prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's
attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This
hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit
DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,
inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness
on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups
according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and
used for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as
OOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers.

Method: 比较GNNs与Transformers在相对位置编码上的异同，设计合成示例验证其等价性，并在单细胞转录组学数据集上进行实验。

Result: GNNs在无位置信息时性能与Transformers相当，且计算资源消耗更少。

Conclusion: GNNs在单细胞转录组学中可替代Transformers，挑战了Transformers总是最优选择的观念。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers share significant similarities
in their encoding strategies for interacting with features from nodes of
interest, where Transformers use query-key scores and GNNs use edges. Compared
to GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage
dynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships,
thereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training.
However, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no
longer crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in
some fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first
explore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers,
specifically in terms of relative positions. Additionally, we design a
synthetic example to illustrate their equivalence where there are no relative
positions between tokens in the sample. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on a large-scale position-agnostic dataset-single-cell
transcriptomics-finding that GNNs achieve competitive performance compared to
Transformers while consuming fewer computation resources. These findings
provide novel insights for researchers in the field of single-cell
transcriptomics, challenging the prevailing notion that the Transformer is
always the optimum choice.

Motivation: 提升Tsetlin机器的透明度和可解释性，通过概率评分和不确定性量化技术进一步解释模型的预测行为。

Method: 通过分析TM学习动态，推导出概率评分；使用模拟数据验证评分与数据底层概率的关系；在CIFAR-10数据集上应用不确定性量化技术。

Result: 概率评分与数据底层概率显著相关；TM在训练数据域外预测时信心较低，与神经网络的外推现象形成对比。

Conclusion: 提出的概率评分和不确定性量化技术有效提升了TM的可解释性，并为图像分类模型的改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Data modeling using Tsetlin machines (TMs) is all about building logical
rules from the data features. The decisions of the model are based on a
combination of these logical rules. Hence, the model is fully transparent and
it is possible to get explanations of its predictions. In this paper, we
present a probability score for TM predictions and develop new techniques for
uncertainty quantification to increase the explainability further. The
probability score is an inherent property of any TM variant and is derived
through an analysis of the TM learning dynamics. Simulated data is used to show
a clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying
probabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also
reveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training
data domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in
Artificial Neural Networks. The paper concludes with an application of the
uncertainty quantification techniques on an image classification task using the
CIFAR-10 dataset, where they provide new insights and suggest possible
improvements to current TM image classification models.

Abstract: Air pollution poses a critical health threat in cities worldwide, with
nitrogen dioxide levels in Cork, Ireland exceeding World Health Organization
safety standards by up to $278\%$. This study leverages artificial intelligence
to predict air pollution with unprecedented accuracy, analyzing nearly ten
years of data from five monitoring stations combined with 30 years of weather

as the optimal solution, achieving $77\%$ prediction accuracy and significantly
outperforming traditional forecasting methods. Our analysis reveals that
meteorological conditions particularly temperature, wind speed, and humidity
are the primary drivers of pollution levels, while traffic patterns and
seasonal changes create predictable pollution cycles. Pollution exhibits
dramatic seasonal variations, with winter levels nearly double those of summer,
and daily rush-hour peaks reaching $120\%$ above normal levels. While Cork's
air quality shows concerning violations of global health standards, our models
detected an encouraging $31\%$ improvement from 2014 to 2022. This research
demonstrates that intelligent forecasting systems can provide city planners and
environmental officials with powerful prediction tools, enabling life-saving
early warning systems and informed urban planning decisions. The technology

Motivation: 研究DDPM中噪声预测器与正向过程噪声的关系，澄清基本等式的理论来源。

Method: 推导噪声预测器的显式公式，并基于此提出新的数学证明。

Result: 明确了正向过程噪声对学习预测器的贡献，提供了新的理论见解。

Conclusion: 本文为扩散模型的结构提供了更清晰的理论基础。

Abstract: In denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), the learned noise
predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ is trained to approximate the
forward-process noise $\epsilon_t$. The equality $\nabla_{{\bf x}_t} \log
q({\bf x}_t) = -\frac 1 {\sqrt {1- {\bar \alpha}_t} } \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$ plays a fundamental role in both theoretical analyses and
algorithmic design, and thus is frequently employed across diffusion-based
generative models. In this paper, an explicit formulation of $
\epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ in terms of the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ is derived. This result show how the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ contributes to the learned predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$. Furthermore, based on this formulation, we present a novel and
mathematically rigorous proof of the fundamental equality above, clarifying its
origin and providing new theoretical insight into the structure of diffusion
models.

*Yan Scholten,Sophie Xhonneux,Stephan Günnemann,Leo Schwinn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的遗忘方法Partial Model Collapse (PMC)，避免直接优化敏感数据，而是通过部分模型崩溃实现遗忘，解决了现有方法可能强化敏感数据暴露的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法通过优化敏感数据实现遗忘，可能反而强化其暴露，且违背最小化使用敏感数据的原则。

Method: 提出PMC方法，利用生成模型在自身生成数据上训练时导致分布崩溃的现象，部分触发崩溃以实现遗忘，无需在目标中包含遗忘数据。

Result: 理论分析表明PMC能收敛到遗忘目标，实验证明其克服了现有方法的局限性，更有效移除私有信息。

Conclusion: PMC为更全面的遗忘方法提供了重要进展，符合实际隐私约束。

Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they
seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue
this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also
fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we
propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does
not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is
inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own
generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information
from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by
triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze
that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the
information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes
two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize
on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from
model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward
more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环肽具有线性肽不具备的几何约束，但设计靶向环肽因训练数据不足而受限。

Method: 将复杂环化模式分解为单元约束，通过扩散模型结合几何条件生成环肽。

Result: 模型能生成多样靶向环肽，不同环化策略成功率为38%-84%。

Conclusion: CP-Composer为环肽设计提供了新方法，填补了训练数据不足的空白。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear
peptides, offer enhanced biochemical properties, presenting new opportunities
to address unmet medical needs. However, designing target-specific cyclic
peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap,
we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot
cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach
decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are
incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and
edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random
combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint
combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show
that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating
diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84%
on different cyclization strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“power attention”的线性成本序列建模层，解决了Transformer和次二次架构在长序列训练中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer处理长序列成本过高，而次二次架构成本过低，滑动窗口注意力等方法又损害了上下文学习能力。

Method: 引入power attention层，其状态大小可独立于参数调整，并开发了高效的GPU内核。

Result: 实验表明，power attention在长上下文训练中优于指数注意力和线性注意力。

Conclusion: power attention是一种有效的长序列建模解决方案。

Abstract: We argue that neither transformers nor sub-quadratic architectures are well
suited to training at long sequence lengths: the cost of processing the context
is too expensive in the former, too inexpensive in the latter. Approaches such
as sliding window attention which reduce the cost-per-token of a transformer
impair in-context learning, and so are also unsuitable. To address these
limitations, we introduce power attention, an architectural layer for
linear-cost sequence modeling whose state size can be adjusted independently of
parameters, unlocking the advantages of linear attention on practical domains.
We develop and open-source a set of GPU kernels for efficient power attention,
identifying a novel pattern of operation fusion to avoid memory and bandwidth
bottlenecks. Our experiments on the in-context learning of power attention
shows that these models dominate both exponential attention and linear
attention at long-context training.

Result: 在多个基准测试中有效减少过度拒绝，同时保持对有害查询的处理能力。

Conclusion: ACTOR提供了一种高效且精确的方法来优化LLMs的拒绝机制。

Abstract: Safety alignment is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to resist
malicious instructions but often results in over-refusals, where benign prompts
are unnecessarily rejected, impairing user experience and model utility. We
introduce ACTOR (Activation-Based Training for Over-Refusal Reduction), a
robust and compute- and data-efficient training framework that minimizes
over-refusals by leveraging internal activation patterns from diverse queries.
ACTOR precisely identifies and adjusts the activation components that trigger
refusals, providing stronger control over the refusal mechanism. By fine-tuning
only a single model layer, ACTOR effectively reduces over-refusals across
multiple benchmarks while maintaining the model's ability to handle harmful
queries and preserve overall utility.

Result: Retformer在多种性能指标上优于基准算法，提升幅度达11%。

Conclusion: Retformer为AD早期诊断提供了高效且可解释的工具，验证了视网膜图像作为生物标志物的潜力。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects
millions worldwide. In the absence of effective treatment options, early
diagnosis is crucial for initiating management strategies to delay disease
onset and slow down its progression. In this study, we propose Retformer, a
novel transformer-based architecture for detecting AD using retinal imaging
modalities, leveraging the power of transformers and explainable artificial
intelligence. The Retformer model is trained on datasets of different
modalities of retinal images from patients with AD and age-matched healthy
controls, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships between image
features and disease diagnosis. To provide insights into the decision-making
process of our model, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
algorithm to visualize the feature importance maps, highlighting the regions of
the retinal images that contribute most significantly to the classification
outcome. These findings are compared to existing clinical studies on detecting
AD using retinal biomarkers, allowing us to identify the most important
features for AD detection in each imaging modality. The Retformer model
outperforms a variety of benchmark algorithms across different performance
metrics by margins of up to 11\.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Prototype Normalization (ProtoNorm)的新方法，通过Prototype Alignment (PA)和Prototype Upscaling (PU)优化原型分离，提升了联邦学习中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据分布和模型架构的异质性挑战，特别是原型分离不足的问题。

Method: 结合PA（基于Thomson问题优化全局原型配置）和PU（增加原型幅度以增强分离），提出ProtoNorm框架。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，原型分离效果更好。

Conclusion: ProtoNorm继承了PBFL的通信效率，适合资源受限环境。

Abstract: Heterogeneity in data distributions and model architectures remains a
significant challenge in federated learning (FL). Various heterogeneous FL
(HtFL) approaches have recently been proposed to address this challenge. Among
them, prototype-based FL (PBFL) has emerged as a practical framework that only
shares per-class mean activations from the penultimate layer. However, PBFL
approaches often suffer from suboptimal prototype separation, limiting their
discriminative power. We propose Prototype Normalization (ProtoNorm), a novel
PBFL framework that addresses this limitation through two key components:
Prototype Alignment (PA) and Prototype Upscaling (PU). The PA method draws
inspiration from the Thomson problem in classical physics, optimizing global
prototype configurations on a unit sphere to maximize angular separation;
subsequently, the PU method increases prototype magnitudes to enhance
separation in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show
that our approach better separates prototypes and thus consistently outperforms
existing HtFL approaches. Notably, since ProtoNorm inherits the communication
efficiency of PBFL and the PA is performed server-side, it is particularly
suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中通信效率低的问题，特别是在资源受限环境下。

Method: 采用类原型稀疏化（CPS）和自适应原型缩放技术。

Result: 实验表明，TinyProto通信成本降低4倍，性能不降。

Conclusion: TinyProto高效且适用于资源受限的异构联邦学习。

Abstract: Communication efficiency in federated learning (FL) remains a critical
challenge for resource-constrained environments. While prototype-based FL
reduces communication overhead by sharing class prototypes-mean activations in
the penultimate layer-instead of model parameters, its efficiency decreases
with larger feature dimensions and class counts. We propose TinyProto, which
addresses these limitations through Class-wise Prototype Sparsification (CPS)
and adaptive prototype scaling. CPS enables structured sparsity by allocating
specific dimensions to class prototypes and transmitting only non-zero
elements, while adaptive scaling adjusts prototypes based on class
distributions. Our experiments show TinyProto reduces communication costs by up
to 4x compared to existing methods while maintaining performance. Beyond its
communication efficiency, TinyProto offers crucial advantages: achieving
compression without client-side computational overhead and supporting
heterogeneous architectures, making it ideal for resource-constrained
heterogeneous FL.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
enabling technology for aligning AI behavior with human preferences. The
traditional way to collect data in RLHF is via pairwise comparisons: human
raters are asked to indicate which one of two samples they prefer. We present
an interactive visualization that better exploits the human visual ability to
compare and explore whole groups of samples. The interface is comprised of two
linked views: 1) an exploration view showing a contextual overview of all
sampled behaviors organized in a hierarchical clustering structure; and 2) a
comparison view displaying two selected groups of behaviors for user queries.
Users can efficiently explore large sets of behaviors by iterating between
these two views. Additionally, we devised an active learning approach
suggesting groups for comparison. As shown by our evaluation in six simulated
robotics tasks, our approach increases the final policy returns by 69.34%. It
leads to lower error rates and better policies. We open-source the code that
can be easily integrated into the RLHF training loop, supporting research on
human-AI alignment.

Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法（如MAE、对比学习）忽略了农业景观的时间特性（如自然周期），因此需要针对性的预训练任务。

Method: 提出三种新预训练任务：时间差预测（TD）、时间频率预测（FP）和未来帧预测（FF）。

Result: 在SICKLE数据集上，FF在作物制图上达到69.6% IoU，FP将产量预测误差降至30.7% MAPE；FF在印度全国尺度上表现优于基线。

Conclusion: 农业特定预训练任务显著提升了遥感基础模型在农业场景的性能，证明了时间特性的重要性。

Abstract: Self Supervised Learning(SSL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
label-efficient learning, and has been widely utilized by remote sensing
foundation models(RSFMs). Recent RSFMs including SatMAE, DoFA, primarily rely
on masked autoencoding(MAE), contrastive learning or some combination of them.
However, these pretext tasks often overlook the unique temporal characteristics
of agricultural landscape, namely nature's cycle. Motivated by this gap, we
propose three novel agriculture-specific pretext tasks, namely Time-Difference
Prediction(TD), Temporal Frequency Prediction(FP), and Future-Frame
Prediction(FF). Comprehensive evaluation on SICKLE dataset shows FF achieves
69.6% IoU on crop mapping and FP reduces yield prediction error to 30.7% MAPE,
outperforming all baselines, and TD remains competitive on most tasks. Further,
we also scale FF to the national scale of India, achieving 54.2% IoU
outperforming all baselines on field boundary delineation on FTW India dataset.

Conclusion: 强化学习的自适应特征选择方法在恶意软件分类中表现优异，实现了高准确率和显著计算效率提升。

Abstract: Traditional malware detection methods exhibit computational inefficiency due
to exhaustive feature extraction requirements, creating accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs that limit real-time deployment. We formulate malware classification
as a Markov Decision Process with episodic feature acquisition and propose a
Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) framework for adaptive sequential feature
selection. The agent learns to dynamically select informative features per
sample before terminating with classification decisions, optimizing both
detection accuracy and computational cost through reinforcement learning.
  We evaluate our approach on Microsoft Big2015 (9-class, 1,795 features) and
BODMAS (binary, 2,381 features) datasets. D3QN achieves 99.22% and 98.83%
accuracy while utilizing only 61 and 56 features on average, representing 96.6%
and 97.6% dimensionality reduction. This yields computational efficiency
improvements of 30.1x and 42.5x over traditional ensemble methods.
Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent superiority over Random
Forest, XGBoost, and static feature selection approaches.
  Quantitative analysis demonstrates that D3QN learns non-random feature
selection policies with 62.5% deviation from uniform baseline distributions.
The learned policies exhibit structured hierarchical preferences, utilizing
high-level metadata features for initial assessment while selectively
incorporating detailed behavioral features based on classification uncertainty.
Feature specialization analysis reveals 57.7% of examined features demonstrate
significant class-specific discrimination patterns. Our results validate
reinforcement learning-based sequential feature selection for malware
classification, achieving superior accuracy with substantial computational
reduction through learned adaptive policies.

Result: 在树结构和随机图变体上表现显著优于现有方法，实验验证了训练成本的优势。

Conclusion: 提出的因果HRL框架在理论和实验上均优于现有工作，为HRL任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) improves the efficiency of
long-horizon reinforcement-learning tasks with sparse rewards by decomposing
the task into a hierarchy of subgoals. The main challenge of HRL is efficient
discovery of the hierarchical structure among subgoals and utilizing this
structure to achieve the final goal. We address this challenge by modeling the
subgoal structure as a causal graph and propose a causal discovery algorithm to
learn it. Additionally, rather than intervening on the subgoals at random
during exploration, we harness the discovered causal model to prioritize
subgoal interventions based on their importance in attaining the final goal.
These targeted interventions result in a significantly more efficient policy in
terms of the training cost. Unlike previous work on causal HRL, which lacked
theoretical analysis, we provide a formal analysis of the problem.
Specifically, for tree structures and, for a variant of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs, our approach results in remarkable improvements. Our
experimental results on HRL tasks also illustrate that our proposed framework
outperforms existing work in terms of training cost.

Conclusion: APCs是一种强大且灵活的表征学习方法，展示了在鲁棒推理、分布外检测和知识蒸馏中的潜力。

Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are powerful probabilistic models that enable
exact and tractable inference, making them highly suitable for probabilistic
reasoning and inference tasks. While dominant in neural networks,
representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches
relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address
this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel
framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings
explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining
embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC
encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is
seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable
architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation
demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in
reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit
superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders.
These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning
method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing
promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and
knowledge distillation.

Abstract: A hierarchical labeling system for mobile applications (apps) benefits a wide
range of downstream businesses that integrate the labeling with their
proprietary user data, to improve user modeling. Such a label hierarchy can
define more granular labels that capture detailed app features beyond the
limitations of traditional broad app categories. In this paper, we address the
problem of hierarchical multilabel classification for apps by using their
textual information such as names and descriptions. We present: 1) HMCN
(Hierarchical Multilabel Classification Network) for handling the
classification from two perspectives: the first focuses on a multilabel
classification without hierarchical constraints, while the second predicts
labels sequentially at each hierarchical level considering such constraints; 2)
HMCL (Hierarchical Multilabel Contrastive Learning), a scheme that is capable
of learning more distinguishable app representations to enhance the performance
of HMCN. Empirical results on our Tencent App Store dataset and two public

*Tim Beyer,Yan Scholten,Stephan Günnemann,Leo Schwinn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的对抗鲁棒性评估框架，通过建模整个输出分布（包括尾部风险）来更准确地评估大规模语言模型的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法通常针对单点贪婪生成的有害响应，忽略了语言模型的随机性，因此需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 将攻击过程建模为优化与采样之间的资源分配问题，确定计算最优权衡，并将采样集成到现有攻击中。

Result: 集成采样后，攻击成功率（ASR）提升高达48%，效率提升两个数量级；发现大多数优化策略对输出危害性影响有限。

Conclusion: 尾部感知的攻击和评估协议对准确评估和增强语言模型安全性至关重要。

Abstract: To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at
scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness.
Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in
single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature
of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness
evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including
tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By
casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between
optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that
integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves
efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to
analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions.
Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on
output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept
objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware
perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight
the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately
assess and strengthen LLM safety.

TL;DR: ESSA框架利用进化策略（ES）高效对齐大语言模型（LLMs），避免了梯度计算的高成本和不稳定性，并通过低秩适应降低优化维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF方法在计算成本、内存需求和训练稳定性上存在问题，尤其是在大规模模型上。

Method: 提出ESSA框架，结合进化策略和低秩适应，实现高效对齐。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，ESSA比梯度方法（如GRPO）收敛更快且数据效率更高。

Conclusion: ES为梯度对齐提供了可扩展的替代方案，支持大语言模型的高效后训练。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relying on alignment techniques
to ensure that their outputs match human preferences. Although reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) is the dominant approach, it has high
computational costs, memory requirements, and training instability,
particularly when scaling to larger models. This paper introduces ESSA
(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses
Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for
gradient computation. ES is well-suited for LLM alignment due to its favorable
properties, such as high parallelizability, memory efficiency, robustness to
sparse rewards, and fewer data samples required for convergence, especially
when starting from a strong pre-trained policy. Moreover, ES eliminates the
need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, making the alignment process simpler
and more stable. Although ES excels in low-dimensional optimization, it poses a
challenge when applied to high-dimensional LLMs. To address this challenge, we
propose a parameter-efficient architectural modification that reduces the
dimensionality of optimization through low-rank adaptation. We evaluated our
approach on mathematical reasoning tasks with verifiable accuracy-based
metrics, demonstrating that ESSA converges faster and is more data efficient
than gradient-based methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our
findings establish ES as a promising and scalable alternative to gradient-based
alignment, paving the way for efficient post-training of large language models.

This paper investigates model inversion attacks on the Llama 3.2 model, a
multilingual LLM developed by Meta. By querying the model with carefully
crafted prompts, we demonstrate the extraction of personally identifiable

findings highlight the vulnerability of even smaller LLMs to privacy attacks
and underscore the need for robust defenses. We discuss potential mitigation
strategies, including differential privacy and data sanitization, and call for
further research into privacy-preserving machine learning techniques.

Conclusion: 本文为LLM-based RAG系统提供了一种可靠且经济的解释性方法，填补了强大归因技术与实际应用之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: While attribution methods, such as Shapley values, are widely used to explain
the importance of features or training data in traditional machine learning,
their application to Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly within
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, is nascent and challenging. The
primary obstacle is the substantial computational cost, where each utility
function evaluation involves an expensive LLM call, resulting in direct
monetary and time expenses. This paper investigates the feasibility and
effectiveness of adapting Shapley-based attribution to identify influential
retrieved documents in RAG. We compare Shapley with more computationally
tractable approximations and some existing attribution methods for LLM. Our
work aims to: (1) systematically apply established attribution principles to
the RAG document-level setting; (2) quantify how well SHAP approximations can
mirror exact attributions while minimizing costly LLM interactions; and (3)
evaluate their practical explainability in identifying critical documents,
especially under complex inter-document relationships such as redundancy,
complementarity, and synergy. This study seeks to bridge the gap between
powerful attribution techniques and the practical constraints of LLM-based RAG
systems, offering insights into achieving reliable and affordable RAG
explainability.

Motivation: 现有PEFT方法在领域专业化任务中计算效率低且性能不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出LoSiA，动态定位并优化关键参数，通过梯度稀疏分析选择子网络作为训练目标。

Result: LoSiA在性能接近全微调的同时，显著减少训练时间；LoSiA-Pro比LoRA快27%。

Conclusion: LoSiA在计算效率和性能上均有优势，适用于领域专业化和常识推理任务。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly
reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition
matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in
domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and
sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources
Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes
and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it
identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as
the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by
updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix
multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA,
which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive
evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to
full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain
specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that
LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练模型（如LLM）存在计算冗余，压缩模型可降低成本且不显著影响性能。

Method: 将神经元宽度缩减问题建模为离散最优运输问题，结合熵正则化和矩阵分解。

Result: DOTResize在多种LLM上表现优于现有剪枝技术，显著降低实际计算成本。

Conclusion: DOTResize为模型压缩提供了一种高效且性能保留的新方法。

Abstract: Model compression offers a promising path to reducing the cost and
inaccessibility of large pre-trained models, without significantly compromising
their impressive performance. Large Transformer models, including large
language models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve
as a target for new model compression methods. In this work, we specifically
target neuron-level redundancies in model layers by combining groups of similar
neurons into fewer neurons. We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal
Transport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression
method that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model
weights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we
motivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into
the transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches
which discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the
entire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal
across the reduced layer. Empirical results show that compared to simple or
state-of-the-art neuron width-pruning techniques, DOTResize can outperform
these methods across multiple LLM families and sizes, while achieving
measurable reductions in real-world computational cost.

Conclusion: 该模型在资源受限的边缘设备上实现了高效且准确的AMC，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Efficient spectrum utilization is critical to meeting the growing data
demands of modern wireless communication networks. Automatic Modulation
Classification (AMC) plays a key role in enhancing spectrum efficiency by
accurately identifying modulation schemes in received signals-an essential
capability for dynamic spectrum allocation and interference mitigation,
particularly in cognitive radio (CR) systems. With the increasing deployment of
smart edge devices, such as IoT nodes with limited computational and memory
resources, there is a pressing need for lightweight AMC models that balance low
complexity with high classification accuracy. This paper proposes a
low-complexity, lightweight deep learning (DL) AMC model optimized for
resource-constrained edge devices. We introduce a dual-path deep residual
shrinkage network (DP-DRSN) with Garrote thresholding for effective signal
denoising and design a compact hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture comprising only
27,000 training parameters. The proposed model achieves average classification

Conclusion: 该模型支持实时适应性和可解释性，适用于无线数字孪生平台和6G网络规划。

Abstract: We present Photon Splatting, a physics-guided neural surrogate model for
real-time wireless channel prediction in complex environments. The proposed
framework introduces surface-attached virtual sources, referred to as photons,
which carry directional wave signatures informed by the scene geometry and
transmitter configuration. At runtime, channel impulse responses (CIRs) are
predicted by splatting these photons onto the angular domain of the receiver
using a geodesic rasterizer. The model is trained to learn a physically
grounded representation that maps transmitter-receiver configurations to full
channel responses. Once trained, it generalizes to new transmitter positions,
antenna beam patterns, and mobile receivers without requiring model retraining.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through a series of
experiments, from canonical 3D scenes to a complex indoor cafe with 1,000
receivers. Results show 30 millisecond-level inference latency and accurate CIR
predictions across a wide range of configurations. The approach supports
real-time adaptability and interpretability, making it a promising candidate
for wireless digital twin platforms and future 6G network planning.

Result: 在稀疏奖励的困难探索环境中实现了最先进的样本效率。

Conclusion: 利用专家演示和模拟器重置功能，结合安全概念的辅助初始状态分布选择，能显著提升在线强化学习的样本效率。

Abstract: A long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL) is of ensuring
sample efficiency, which stems from an inability to explore environments
efficiently. Most attempts at efficient exploration tackle this problem in a
setting where learning begins from scratch, without prior information available
to bootstrap learning. However, such approaches fail to leverage expert
demonstrations and simulators that can reset to arbitrary states. These
affordances are valuable resources that offer enormous potential to guide
exploration and speed up learning. In this paper, we explore how a small number
of expert demonstrations and a simulator allowing arbitrary resets can
accelerate learning during online RL. We find that training with a suitable
choice of an auxiliary start state distribution that may differ from the true
start state distribution of the underlying Markov Decision Process can
significantly improve sample efficiency. We find that using a notion of safety
to inform the choice of this auxiliary distribution significantly accelerates
learning. By using episode length information as a way to operationalize this
notion, we demonstrate state-of-the-art sample efficiency on a sparse-reward
hard-exploration environment.

require such preprocessing (e.g., AWQ and GPTQ). We also experiment with any3
and any2 and show competitiveness at lower bits. Additionally, we show that we
can calibrate using a single curated diverse sample rather than hundreds of
samples from a dataset as done in most quantization approaches. We also open

Result: 在Tiny ImageNet和ImageNet子集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在低IPC下。

Conclusion: IGDS有效提升数据集蒸馏性能，适用于各种IPC设置。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact dataset that retains essential
information while maintaining model performance. Diffusion models (DMs) have
shown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC)
settings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address
this issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key
types of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype
information $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and
($ii$) contextual information $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class
variability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables
corresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.
Observing that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose
maximizing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \beta \mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling
process, where $\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing
$\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop
variational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a
data-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling
(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset
distillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet
subsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly
in low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: 6G networks promise revolutionary immersive communication experiences
including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and holographic
communications. These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data
transmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely
challenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems. Moreover, a
joint understanding of the environment, context, and user intent is essential
to deliver task-relevant content effectively. This article presents a novel
multimodal large language model (MLLM) integrated semantic communications
framework, termed MLLM-SC, which fully leverages reasoning and generative
capabilities of pre-trained foundation models for context-aware and
task-oriented wireless communication. The MLLM-SC framework adopts a
device-edge collaborative architecture. At the edge, MLLM-empowered semantic
guidance module analyzes multimodal inputs, user intents, and channel
conditions to generate importance-aware attention maps prioritizing
semantically critical information. An importance-aware semantic encoder and a
resource-adaptive semantic decoder are jointly designed and optimized, which
can utilize the semantic guidance for adaptive bandwidth allocation and
high-quality content reconstruction or generation. Extensive case studies on
visual question answering for AR/VR applications and diffusion-driven image
generation validate the effectiveness of MLLM-SC.

Motivation: 传统网格搜索调整自编码器隐藏层大小需要大量计算和时间，亟需更高效的方法。

Method: 受物理学启发，SOSAE通过惩罚特征向量的幅度和位置索引，结构化地诱导稀疏性，动态优化特征空间维度。

Result: 实验表明，SOSAE在保持调优质量和性能的同时，将浮点运算（FLOPs）减少至其他基线的1/130。

Conclusion: SOSAE为自编码器的特征空间维度调优提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: The process of tuning the size of the hidden layers for autoencoders has the
benefit of providing optimally compressed representations for the input data.
However, such hyper-parameter tuning process would take a lot of computation
and time effort with grid search as the default option. In this paper, we
introduce the Self-Organization Regularization for Autoencoders that
dynamically adapts the dimensionality of the feature space to the optimal size.
Inspired by physics concepts, Self-Organizing Sparse AutoEncoder (SOSAE)
induces sparsity in feature space in a structured way that permits the
truncation of the non-active part of the feature vector without any loss of
information. This is done by penalizing the autoencoder based on the magnitude
and the positional index of the feature vector dimensions, which during
training constricts the feature space in both terms. Extensive experiments on
various datasets show that our SOSAE can tune the feature space dimensionality
up to 130 times lesser Floating-point Operations (FLOPs) than other baselines
while maintaining the same quality of tuning and performance.

loss is defined as L _cycleb equal L(Y reduce {\Phi}({\Psi}(Y))) (and vice
versa). By minimizing this loss, the framework establishes a closed-loop
mechanism integrating generation and validation phases, eliminating the need
for manual rule design or prior distribution assumptions. Experiments on
normalized synthetic and simulated datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves a cycle reconstruction error below 0.003, achieving an
improvement of approximately 30% in evaluation metrics compared to baseline
models without cycle consistency. Furthermore, the framework supports
unsupervised learning and significantly reduces reliance on manual
intervention, demonstrating potential advantages in non-injective regression
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出HAS-CGAN方法，通过数据增强解决超精密加工中表面粗糙度预测的小数据集问题，显著提升预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超精密加工中表面粗糙度预测对实时质量控制至关重要，但小数据集限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出HAS-CGAN（混合对抗谱损失CGAN），通过傅里叶域优化生成高质量1D力信号，并结合加工参数增强数据。

Result: HAS-CGAN在生成高频信号方面表现优异，预测误差从31.4%降至约9%。

Conclusion: HAS-CGAN有效解决了数据稀缺问题，显著提升了表面粗糙度预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate surface roughness prediction in ultra-precision machining (UPM) is
critical for real-time quality control, but small datasets hinder model
performance. We propose HAS-CGAN, a Hybrid Adversarial Spectral Loss CGAN, for
effective UPM data augmentation. Among five CGAN variants tested, HAS-CGAN
excels in 1D force signal generation, particularly for high-frequency signals,
achieving >0.85 wavelet coherence through Fourier-domain optimization. By
combining generated signals with machining parameters, prediction accuracy
significantly improves. Experiments with traditional ML (SVR, RF, LSTM) and
deep learning models (BPNN, 1DCNN, CNN-Transformer) demonstrate that augmenting
training data with 520+ synthetic samples reduces prediction error from 31.4%
(original 52 samples) to ~9%, effectively addressing data scarcity in UPM
roughness prediction."

TL;DR: DANCE提出了一种动态神经架构搜索方法，通过连续演化学习架构分布，解决了现有NAS方法在适应性、搜索成本和性能一致性上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NAS方法在真实部署中面临适应性差、搜索成本高和性能不一致的挑战。

Method: DANCE将架构搜索重新定义为连续演化问题，引入连续架构分布、统一架构空间和多阶段训练策略。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验显示，DANCE在准确性和搜索成本上优于现有NAS方法，并能适应不同硬件需求。

Conclusion: DANCE通过动态架构和连续演化，显著提升了NAS的适应性和效率。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful approach for
automating neural network design. However, existing NAS methods face critical
limitations in real-world deployments: architectures lack adaptability across
scenarios, each deployment context requires costly separate searches, and
performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We
propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which
reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through
learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three
key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth
adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for
efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective
deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate
DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS
approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs.
Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance
while smoothly adapting architectures to different hardware requirements. The

TL;DR: 论文提出SEED方法，通过自蒸馏消除大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中的幻觉问题，显著提升模型可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部工具或多轮推理比较，增加了推理时间，而SEED通过内部知识自蒸馏解决幻觉问题。

Method: SEED通过识别、隔离和净化幻觉知识，再蒸馏回模型，并引入Mode-Seeking Evolving方法和Hallucination Elimination Adapter。

Result: 实验表明SEED显著减少幻觉，如LLaVA-1.5的POPE-Random F1分数从81.3提升至88.3。

Conclusion: SEED是一种高效的自蒸馏方法，能显著提升LVLM的可信度和应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination
issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential.
Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison
of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation
(\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of
LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back
into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that
traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the
output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking
Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of
the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that
could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination
Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by
learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in
mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and
InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination
evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

TL;DR: 论文提出Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR)方法，通过逐步缩放权重防止无界权重增长，恢复网络可塑性，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络训练中无界权重增长导致可塑性丧失，影响泛化和优化动态，现有方法如重新初始化会丢失信息。

Method: 提出SWR方法，通过逐步缩放权重防止无界增长，同时保留学习信息。

Result: 实验证明SWR在热启动学习、持续学习和单任务学习中提升性能。

Conclusion: SWR有效解决权重无界增长问题，恢复网络可塑性，提升多种学习场景下的性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that as training progresses, neural networks
gradually lose their capacity to learn new information, a phenomenon known as
plasticity loss. An unbounded weight growth is one of the main causes of
plasticity loss. Furthermore, it harms generalization capability and disrupts
optimization dynamics. Re-initializing the network can be a solution, but it
results in the loss of learned information, leading to performance drops. In
this paper, we propose Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR), a novel approach that
prevents unbounded weight growth without losing information. SWR recovers the
plasticity of the network by simply scaling down the weight at each step of the
learning process. We theoretically prove that SWR bounds weight magnitude and
balances weight magnitude between layers. Our experiment shows that SWR
improves performance on warm-start learning, continual learning, and
single-task learning setups on standard image classification benchmarks.

TL;DR: MJKAN是一种新型神经网络层，结合了KAN的非线性表达能力和MLP的效率，通过FiLM机制和RBF激活函数改进KAN的计算成本和性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs因其可学习的单变量函数替代固定激活函数而受到关注，但存在高计算成本和通用分类任务性能不足的问题。

Method: MJKAN集成了类似FiLM的机制和RBF激活函数，形成混合架构，结合KAN的非线性表达能力和MLP的效率。

Result: 在函数回归任务中，MJKAN表现优于MLP，性能随基函数数量增加而提升；在图像和文本分类中，性能与MLP相当，但基函数数量需谨慎调整以避免过拟合。

Conclusion: MJKAN继承了KAN的理论优势，同时提高了计算效率和实用性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed
activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit
practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance
deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the
Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome
these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like
mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid
architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the
efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's
performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression,
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG
News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior
approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly
outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions
increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was
competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis
functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better
generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned
to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN
offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs
while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF方法依赖不透明的奖励函数，缺乏可解释性，CB-RM旨在通过概念标注实现透明且可审计的偏好学习。

Method: 提出CB-RM框架，将奖励预测分解为可解释概念，并设计基于预期信息增益的主动学习策略动态获取概念标签。

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上，CB-RM在可解释性和样本效率上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CB-RM为透明、可审计且与人类对齐的奖励模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Concept Bottleneck Reward Models (CB-RM), a reward modeling
framework that enables interpretable preference learning through selective
concept annotation. Unlike standard RLHF methods that rely on opaque reward
functions, CB-RM decomposes reward prediction into human-interpretable
concepts. To make this framework efficient in low-supervision settings, we
formalize an active learning strategy that dynamically acquires the most
informative concept labels. We propose an acquisition function based on
Expected Information Gain and show that it significantly accelerates concept
learning without compromising preference accuracy. Evaluated on the
UltraFeedback dataset, our method outperforms baselines in interpretability and
sample efficiency, marking a step towards more transparent, auditable, and
human-aligned reward models.

Abstract: Generative AI technology based on Large Language Models (LLM) has been
developed and applied to assist or automatically generate program codes. In
this paper, we evaluate the capability of existing general LLMs for Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) code generation for CPUs. We use two LLMs
provided by OpenAI: GPT-4.1, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model,
and o4-mini, one of the o-series of Reasoning models. Both have been released
in April 2025. For the routines from level-1 to 3 BLAS, we tried to generate
(1) C code without optimization from routine name only, (2) C code with basic
performance optimizations (thread parallelization, SIMD vectorization, and
cache blocking) from routine name only, and (3) C code with basic performance
optimizations based on Fortran reference code. As a result, we found that
correct code can be generated in many cases even when only routine name are
given. We also confirmed that thread parallelization with OpenMP, SIMD
vectorization, and cache blocking can be implemented to some extent, and that
the code is faster than the reference code.

Conclusion: UrbanMind为实现未来城市环境中的通用LLM智能体迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Urban general intelligence (UGI) refers to the capacity of AI systems to
autonomously perceive, reason, and act within dynamic and complex urban
environments. In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI.
Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual
Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates
domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term
adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel
optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent
sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either
independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework
is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise
optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive
under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating
mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity
verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a
promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future
urban environments.

toy localization task with a convolutional architecture and show that
normalization layers enable an iterative message passing procedure, allowing

results suggest that normalization layers should be employed with caution in
applications such as diffusion-based trajectory generation, where maintaining a

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

Result: 在三个特征漂移数据集上，FedPall表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: FedPall有效解决了联邦学习中的特征漂移问题，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of a global model in
the centralized server with data from multiple parties while preserving
privacy. However, data heterogeneity can significantly degrade the performance
of the global model when each party uses datasets from different sources to
train a local model, thereby affecting personalized local models. Among various
cases of data heterogeneity, feature drift, feature space difference among
parties, is prevalent in real-life data but remains largely unexplored. Feature
drift can distract feature extraction learning in clients and thus lead to poor
feature extraction and classification performance. To tackle the problem of
feature drift in FL, we propose FedPall, an FL framework that utilizes
prototype-based adversarial learning to unify feature spaces and collaborative
learning to reinforce class information within the features. Moreover, FedPall
leverages mixed features generated from global prototypes and local features to
enhance the global classifier with classification-relevant information from a
global perspective. Evaluation results on three representative feature-drifted
datasets demonstrate FedPall's consistently superior performance in
classification with feature-drifted data in the FL scenario.

Result: 该方法加速模型收敛，提升准确性和可靠性，尤其适用于小规模、类别不平衡或含虚假特征的数据。

Conclusion: 通过结合解释信号，该方法在小数据集上实现了更可靠和高效的模型训练。

Abstract: Acquiring and training on large-scale labeled data can be impractical due to
cost constraints. Additionally, the use of small training datasets can result
in considerable variability in model outcomes, overfitting, and learning of
spurious correlations. A crucial shortcoming of data labels is their lack of
any reasoning behind a specific label assignment, causing models to learn any
arbitrary classification rule as long as it aligns data with labels. To
overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative approach for training
reliable classification models on smaller datasets, by using simple explanation
signals such as important input features from labeled data. Our method centers
around a two-stage training cycle that alternates between enhancing model
prediction accuracy and refining its attention to match the explanations. This
instructs models to grasp the rationale behind label assignments during their
learning phase. We demonstrate that our training cycle expedites the
convergence towards more accurate and reliable models, particularly for small,
class-imbalanced training data, or data with spurious features.

Abstract: The growing adoption of domain-specific architectures in edge computing
platforms for deep learning has highlighted the efficiency of hardware
accelerators. However, integrating custom accelerators into modern machine
learning (ML) compilers remains a complex challenge due to the need for
significant modifications in compilation layers and specialized scheduling
techniques. Existing frameworks offer partial solutions and require users to
navigate intricate compiler internals.
  In this paper, we introduce a TVM-based compilation integration approach that
targets GEMM-based deep learning accelerators. Our approach abstracts the
complexities of compiler integration, enabling seamless integration of
accelerators without requiring in-depth knowledge of the underlying compiler.
Furthermore, we extend and incorporate design space exploration tools,
specifically CoSA, to automate efficient tensor scheduling, accounting for
factors such as uneven mapping and double buffering. Our framework is
benchmarked on the Gemmini accelerator, demonstrating performance comparable to
its specialized manually implemented toolchain.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various
sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by
the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further
improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we
propose a novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion
models through a principled diffusion trajectory alignment. Instead of applying
the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire
discrete denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise
alignment objectives. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization,
is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, guarantees an
equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory
reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design,
protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the
superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement
over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on
DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 80.7 on
LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.

Result: 实验表明，NTSFormer在多模态冷启动节点分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: NTSFormer通过自学习和多模态融合，有效解决了冷启动节点分类问题。

Abstract: Cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because
cold-start nodes are isolated (i.e., no edges) and often have missing
modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address
structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start
inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,
this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further
challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose
Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer
framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a
self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention
mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student"
prediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and
a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This
enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby
fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To
handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a
one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature
data into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.
Experimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior
performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems are increasingly used in
safety-critical applications, yet their security remains severely
underexplored. This work investigates backdoor attacks, which implant hidden
triggers that cause malicious actions only when specific inputs appear in the
observation space. Existing DRL backdoor research focuses solely on
training-time attacks requiring unrealistic access to the training pipeline. In
contrast, we reveal critical vulnerabilities across the DRL supply chain where
backdoors can be embedded with significantly reduced adversarial privileges. We
introduce two novel attacks: (1) TrojanentRL, which exploits component-level
flaws to implant a persistent backdoor that survives full model retraining; and
(2) InfrectroRL, a post-training backdoor attack which requires no access to
training, validation, nor test data. Empirical and analytical evaluations
across six Atari environments show our attacks rival state-of-the-art
training-time backdoor attacks while operating under much stricter adversarial
constraints. We also demonstrate that InfrectroRL further evades two leading
DRL backdoor defenses. These findings challenge the current research focus and
highlight the urgent need for robust defenses.

*Ingo Marquardt,Philippe Brule*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究比较了微调与系统提示在语言模型中的应用，发现微调小型开源模型在模拟数据上更有效，能高效实现特定对话风格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在客户语音应用中实现自然对话风格和遵循特定指南的挑战。

Method: 使用LoRA微调开源模型（Llama3.2-1B-Instruct）和闭源模型（gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4.1-mini），基于合成数据集。

Result: 微调表现优于系统提示，即使少量数据（100样本）也能实现高比例对话式响应，且内容质量未下降。8位量化微调收敛更快。

Conclusion: 微调小型开源模型是高效且数据节约的方法，优于复杂系统提示，适用于需要特定风格的实用场景。

Abstract: Deploying language models (LMs) in customer-facing speech applications
requires conversational fluency and adherence to specific stylistic guidelines.
This can be challenging to achieve reliably using complex system prompts due to
issues like instruction following limitations and in-context bias. This study
investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuning versus system prompting for
aligning LMs with a specific behavioral target: responding in a natural,
conversational tone suitable for voice interactions. We fine-tuned a small,
open-weights model (`Llama3.2-1B-Instruct`) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on
a synthetically generated dataset derived from Wikipedia. Additionally, we
fine-tuned two closed-source models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`). Our
results demonstrate that fine-tuning outperformed system prompting, achieving a
high percentage of conversational responses, even when trained on only 100 data
samples. Semantic similarity analysis confirmed that fine-tuning did not
degrade content quality. Interestingly, fine-tuning with 8-bit integer
quantization converged faster towards the target style than using bfloat16
precision, potentially due to implicit regularization effects. We conclude that
fine-tuning small, open-weights LMs on simulated data is a highly effective and
data-efficient method for instilling specific stylistic behaviors, offering a
preferable alternative to complex system prompting for practical applications
requiring nuanced response styles.

Conclusion: 提出的扩散模型架构为物理推理提供了更灵活的条件处理能力，适用于动态环境下的复杂任务。

Abstract: Reasoning about the trajectories of multiple, interacting objects is integral
to physical reasoning tasks in machine learning. This involves conditions
imposed on the objects at different time steps, for instance initial states or
desired goal states. Existing approaches in physical reasoning generally rely
on autoregressive modeling, which can only be conditioned on initial states,
but not on later states. In fields such as planning for reinforcement learning,
similar challenges are being addressed with denoising diffusion models. In this
work, we propose an object-centric denoising diffusion model architecture for
physical reasoning that is translation equivariant over time, permutation
equivariant over objects, and can be conditioned on arbitrary time steps for
arbitrary objects. We demonstrate how this model can solve tasks with multiple
conditions and examine its performance when changing object numbers and
trajectory lengths during inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于贝叶斯主动学习的批量获取策略（ConBatch-BAL），用于解决标注成本差异和预算约束问题，并在真实地理空间数据上验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，数据点的标注成本差异和预算约束限制了主动学习策略的采用。

Method: 提出两种策略：动态阈值法和贪婪法，基于贝叶斯神经网络的不确定性度量选择样本，动态阈值法重新分配预算，贪婪法逐步选择样本。

Result: 在真实地理空间数据集上，ConBatch-BAL策略减少了主动学习迭代和数据获取成本，甚至优于无约束基线。

Conclusion: ConBatch-BAL策略在预算约束下能有效降低主动学习成本，适用于高标注成本场景。

Abstract: Varying annotation costs among data points and budget constraints can hinder
the adoption of active learning strategies in real-world applications. This
work introduces two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition
under constraints (ConBatch-BAL), one based on dynamic thresholding and one
following greedy acquisition. Both select samples using uncertainty metrics
computed via Bayesian neural networks. The dynamic thresholding strategy
redistributes the budget across the batch, while the greedy one selects the
top-ranked sample at each step, limited by the remaining budget. Focusing on
scenarios with costly data annotation and geospatial constraints, we also
release two new real-world datasets containing geolocated aerial images of
buildings, annotated with energy efficiency or typology classes. The
ConBatch-BAL strategies are benchmarked against a random acquisition baseline
on these datasets under various budget and cost scenarios. The results show
that the developed ConBatch-BAL strategies can reduce active learning
iterations and data acquisition costs in real-world settings, and even
outperform the unconstrained baseline solutions.

TL;DR: EAMil是一种多实例深度学习框架，利用TCR测序数据高精度诊断SLE和RA，AUC分别达98.95%和97.76%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TCR库在自身免疫疾病中具有重要免疫学特征，但临床应用受限于序列稀疏性和低见证率。

Method: 结合PrimeSeq特征提取、ESMonehot编码和增强门控注意力机制。

Result: 模型性能优异，识别疾病相关基因一致性超90%，并能区分疾病特异性TCR基因。

Conclusion: EAMil为自身免疫疾病检测和分类提供了可解释框架，具有广泛临床应用潜力。

Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures
for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by
sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance
deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional
accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding
and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art
performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully
identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established
differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes.
The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories,
utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well
as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling
for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework
for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease
detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across
immune-mediated conditions.

Motivation: 现有训练范式依赖大规模非结构化数据集，存在存储成本高、质量评估难、隐私和伦理问题。

Method: 利用多个小规模领域特定数据集，结合元学习在Meta-Album集合上训练上下文学习模型，测试其在未见领域、持续学习和无监督场景中的表现。

Result: 模型在训练领域外仍能泛化，性能与单一大数据集训练的模型相当，同时在模块化和可替换性方面具有优势。

Conclusion: 通过精心策划的数据集集合训练，Transformer模型在上下文预测中仍能泛化，同时解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: In-context learning enables transformer models to generalize to new tasks
based solely on input prompts, without any need for weight updates. However,
existing training paradigms typically rely on large, unstructured datasets that
are costly to store, difficult to evaluate for quality and balance, and pose
privacy and ethical concerns due to the inclusion of sensitive information.
Motivated by these limitations and risks, we propose an alternative training
strategy where we leverage a collection of multiple, small-scale, and
domain-specific datasets. We empirically demonstrate that the increased quality
and diversity of such data improve the generalization abilities of in-context
learners beyond their training domain, while achieving comparable performance
with models trained on a single large-scale dataset. We investigate this
paradigm by leveraging meta-learning to train an in-context learner on the
Meta-Album collection under several settings. Firstly, we show the performance
in a controlled environment, where the test domain is completely excluded from
the training knowledge. Secondly, we explore the robustness of these models to
forgetting in a continual scenario where the information is accessible for a
limited time. Finally, we explore the more challenging unsupervised scenario.
Our findings demonstrate that transformers still generalize for in-context
prediction when trained on a curated dataset collection while offering
advantages in modularity and replaceability.

Method: 使用神经切线核（NTK）分析数据和模型扩展下的神经网络行为。

Result: 发现性能扩展指数相似时，内部动态可能相反；确定了支持特征学习的最大模型宽度。

Conclusion: 性能扩展不能完全解释神经网络机制，需结合内部动态分析；特征学习在有限宽度模型中受限于宽度。

Abstract: Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the relationship between neural
network performance and computational cost, yet their underlying mechanisms
remain poorly understood. In this work, we empirically analyze how neural
networks behave under data and model scaling through the lens of the neural
tangent kernel (NTK). This analysis establishes a link between performance
scaling and the internal dynamics of neural networks. Our findings of standard
vision tasks show that similar performance scaling exponents can occur even
though the internal model dynamics show opposite behavior. This demonstrates
that performance scaling alone is insufficient for understanding the underlying
mechanisms of neural networks. We also address a previously unresolved issue in
neural scaling: how convergence to the infinite-width limit affects scaling
behavior in finite-width models. To this end, we investigate how feature
learning is lost as the model width increases and quantify the transition
between kernel-driven and feature-driven scaling regimes. We identify the
maximum model width that supports feature learning, which, in our setups, we
find to be more than ten times smaller than typical large language model
widths.

Conclusion: 多轮交互状态工具方法在代码修复任务中表现出色，为LLM的高效计算利用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances have established a new machine learning paradigm based on
scaling up compute at inference time as well as at training time. In that line
of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic
demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is
used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during
inference in the form of "thoughts" expressed in natural language. In this
paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction
trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended
to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to
control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of
repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup
allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing
even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend
additional compute on the task.

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶测试提供了可扩展的场景选择基础，提升了测试效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is an indispensable instrument for the comprehensive
validation and verification of automated vehicles (AVs). However, finding a
manageable and finite, yet representative subset of scenarios in a scalable,
possibly unsupervised manner is notoriously challenging. Our work is meant to
constitute a cornerstone to facilitate sample-efficient testing, while still
capturing the diversity of relevant operational design domains (ODDs) and
accounting for the "long tail" phenomenon in particular. To this end, we first
propose an expressive and flexible heterogeneous, spatio-temporal graph model
for representing traffic scenarios. Leveraging recent advances of graph neural
networks (GNNs), we then propose a self-supervised method to learn a universal
embedding space for scenario graphs that enables clustering and similarity
search. In particular, we implement contrastive learning alongside a
bootstrapping-based approach and evaluate their suitability for partitioning
the scenario space. Experiments on the nuPlan dataset confirm the model's
ability to capture semantics and thus group related scenarios in a meaningful
way despite the absence of discrete class labels. Different scenario types
materialize as distinct clusters. Our results demonstrate how variable-length
traffic scenarios can be condensed into single vector representations that
enable nearest-neighbor retrieval of representative candidates for distinct
scenario categories. Notably, this is achieved without manual labeling or bias
towards an explicit objective such as criticality. Ultimately, our approach can
serve as a basis for scalable selection of scenarios to further enhance the
efficiency and robustness of testing AVs in simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注孤立成对评估，忽略了模型重建生物意义PPI网络的能力，这对生物学研究至关重要。

Method: PRING构建了一个高质量的多物种PPI网络数据集，并设计了两种互补的评估范式：拓扑导向任务和功能导向任务。

Result: 实验表明，当前PPI模型在恢复PPI网络的结构和功能特性方面存在局限性。

Conclusion: PRING为开发更有效的PPI预测模型提供了可靠平台。

Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in
predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's
capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is
crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the
first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction
prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,
multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818
interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and
leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two
complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess
intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented
tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and
essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's
capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein
function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism
analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,
consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language
model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI
models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional
properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world
biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide
the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The
dataset and source code of PRING are available at

Conclusion: 本文为KFAC提供了实用的实现指南和测试案例，有助于降低其使用门槛并促进更广泛的应用。

Abstract: Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) is arguably one of the most
prominent curvature approximations in deep learning. Its applications range
from optimization to Bayesian deep learning, training data attribution with
influence functions, and model compression or merging. While the intuition
behind KFAC is easy to understand, its implementation is tedious: It comes in
many flavours, has common pitfalls when translating the math to code, and is
challenging to test, which complicates ensuring a properly functioning
implementation. Some of the authors themselves have dealt with these challenges
and experienced the discomfort of not being able to fully test their code.
Thanks to recent advances in understanding KFAC, we are now able to provide
test cases and a recipe for a reliable KFAC implementation. This tutorial is
meant as a ground-up introduction to KFAC. In contrast to the existing work,
our focus lies on providing both math and code side-by-side and providing test
cases based on the latest insights into KFAC that are scattered throughout the
literature. We hope this tutorial provides a contemporary view of KFAC that
allows beginners to gain a deeper understanding of this curvature approximation
while lowering the barrier to its implementation, extension, and usage in
practice.

Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to extract physical parameters (e.g.,
mobility, Schottky contact barrier height, defect profiles) of two-dimensional
(2D) transistors from electrical measurements, enabling automated parameter
extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate
this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by
training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device
simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural
network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500
devices, a factor >40$\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently,
fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models,
including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic
effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We
apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental
monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination
($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that
this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical
data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters
simultaneously. To facilitate future research on deep learning approaches for
inverse transistor design, we have published our code and sample data sets
online.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在嵌入式场景中的局限性，如不确定性量化和显式规则推理，同时克服符号模型在TinyML硬件上的计算挑战。

Method: 1. 训练硬件高效的确定性PCs；2. 使用n次根压缩技术压缩PCs；3. 在TinyML硬件上部署完整的NSAI模型。

Result: 相比64位精度基线，FPGA硬件资源显著减少（FF减少82.3%，LUTs减少52.6%，Flash减少18.0%），ESP32微控制器推理速度平均提升4.67倍。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了在资源受限的TinyML硬件上高效运行NSAI模型，为嵌入式场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) has recently emerged to mitigate limitations
associated with deep learning (DL) models, e.g. quantifying their uncertainty
or reason with explicit rules. Hence, TinyML hardware will need to support
these symbolic models to bring NSAI to embedded scenarios. Yet, although
symbolic models are typically compact, their sparsity and computation
resolution contrasts with low-resolution and dense neuro models, which is a
challenge on resource-constrained TinyML hardware severely limiting the size of
symbolic models that can be computed. In this work, we remove this bottleneck
leveraging a tight hardware/software integration to present a complete
framework to compute NSAI with TinyML hardware. We focus on symbolic models
realized with tractable probabilistic circuits (PCs), a popular subclass of
probabilistic models for hardware integration. This framework: (1) trains a
specific class of hardware-efficient \emph{deterministic} PCs, chosen for the
symbolic task; (2) \emph{compresses} this PC until it can be computed on TinyML
hardware with minimal accuracy degradation, using our $n^{th}$-root compression
technique, and (3) \emph{deploys} the complete NSAI model on TinyML hardware.
Compared to a 64b precision baseline necessary for the PC without compression,
our workflow leads to significant hardware reduction on FPGA (up to 82.3\% in
FF, 52.6\% in LUTs, and 18.0\% in Flash usage) and an average inference speedup
of 4.67x on ESP32 microcontroller.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generalized Wasserstein-2 distance approach
for efficiently training stochastic neural networks to reconstruct random field
models, where the target random variable comprises both continuous and
categorical components. We prove that a stochastic neural network can
approximate random field models under a Wasserstein-2 distance metric under
nonrestrictive conditions. Furthermore, this stochastic neural network can be
efficiently trained by minimizing our proposed generalized local squared
Wasserstein-2 loss function. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed
approach in various uncertainty quantification tasks, including classification,
reconstructing the distribution of mixed random variables, and learning complex
noisy dynamical systems from spatiotemporal data.

Conclusion: 世界模型的主要目标是模拟现实世界中所有可操作的可能性，以支持有目的的推理和行动，并展望了PAN AGI系统的潜力。

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment
which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging
topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents
with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a
world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it.
In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune,
and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in
psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on
world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating
all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and
acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a
general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed
continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision
learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN)
AGI system enabled by such a model.

Result: “训练-测试”显著提升排名一致性，模型排名在不同基准间具有外部有效性。

Conclusion: 建议将“训练-测试”作为语言模型基准测试的默认步骤。

Abstract: Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even
for benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting
rankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion
to a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking
disagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released,
different models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test
task. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model
the same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary
contribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24
benchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves
ranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have
little external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of
external validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer
gracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family,
train-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect
agreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to
essentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of
benchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make
train-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.

TL;DR: 论文提出从预测范式转向干预范式，强调自动化决策系统（ADS）在社会系统中作为决策支持和实际干预工具的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ADS多聚焦预测问题，但实际部署中它们通过政策干预影响群体结果，需考虑更全面的社会系统影响。

Method: 提出新的问题设置，将预测视为决策支持和干预工具，结合现代统计框架研究ADS的设计、实施和评估。

Result: 揭示了孤立预测任务的局限性，为开发更具干预导向的ADS奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 需转向干预范式，以更全面地评估和优化ADS在社会系统中的影响。

Abstract: Many automated decision systems (ADS) are designed to solve prediction
problems -- where the goal is to learn patterns from a sample of the population
and apply them to individuals from the same population. In reality, these
prediction systems operationalize holistic policy interventions in deployment.
Once deployed, ADS can shape impacted population outcomes through an effective
policy change in how decision-makers operate, while also being defined by past
and present interactions between stakeholders and the limitations of existing
organizational, as well as societal, infrastructure and context. In this work,
we consider the ways in which we must shift from a prediction-focused paradigm
to an interventionist paradigm when considering the impact of ADS within social
systems. We argue this requires a new default problem setup for ADS beyond
prediction, to instead consider predictions as decision support, final
decisions, and outcomes. We highlight how this perspective unifies modern
statistical frameworks and other tools to study the design, implementation, and
evaluation of ADS systems, and point to the research directions necessary to
operationalize this paradigm shift. Using these tools, we characterize the
limitations of focusing on isolated prediction tasks, and lay the foundation
for a more intervention-oriented approach to developing and deploying ADS.

*Rahul Thomas,Louai Zahran,Erica Choi,Akilesh Potti,Micah Goldblum,Arka Pal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多方推理协议Cascade，通过序列维度分片保护隐私，牺牲部分密码学隐私保证以提升性能和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM参数规模增长，计算资源需求增加，第三方推理服务流行但引发隐私担忧。现有安全方案如SMPC开销大且难以扩展。

Method: 利用序列维度分片技术设计Cascade协议，平衡隐私与性能。

Result: Cascade能抵抗广义攻击和学习型攻击，速度比现有方案快多个数量级。

Conclusion: Cascade为现代LLM的安全部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As LLMs continue to increase in parameter size, the computational resources
required to run them are available to fewer parties. Therefore, third-party
inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant
computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third
party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate
these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for
third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However,
SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and
do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party
inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging
sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off
cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We
demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack
that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it
is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of
magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions
for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级方法，通过直接重新加权主题相关标记的logits来增强摘要的主题相关性，实验证明其有效且资源高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成符合特定主题的摘要对语言模型仍具挑战性，传统方法资源密集或难以保持主题聚焦。

Method: 提出三种logits重新加权技术：Constant Shift、Factor Scaling和Threshold Selection，并在NEWTS数据集上评估。

Result: Threshold Selection方法显著提升主题聚焦且不影响摘要质量，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 直接重新加权logits是资源高效的替代方案，可精确控制生成文本的主题内容。

Abstract: Generating abstractive summaries that adhere to a specific topic remains a
significant challenge for language models. While standard approaches, such as
fine-tuning, are resource-intensive, simpler methods like prompt engineering
often struggle to maintain topical focus, particularly with smaller models. To
address this, we propose a lightweight method that enhances topical relevance
by directly reweighting the logits of topic-relevant tokens during generation.
We evaluate three such reweighting techniques: Constant Shift, which adds a
constant value to logits; Factor Scaling, which multiplies them by a factor;
and Threshold Selection, which selectively boosts logits that exceed a
probability threshold. Experiments on the NEWTS topical summarization dataset,
using both Gemma-2B and Llama-3-8B models, show that these techniques
effectively increase the use of topic-relevant vocabulary. Notably, the
Threshold Selection method successfully improves topical focus without
compromising summary quality-a trade-off often seen in other approaches. Our
findings demonstrate that directly reweighting logits is a practical and
resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, offering a promising pathway for
precisely controlling the thematic content of generated text.

Motivation: 传统GWAS方法难以捕捉非线性遗传互作，而现有深度学习方法依赖特征选择策略，可能导致数据泄漏或局限于已知通路。

Method: 研究了不同深度学习架构，并扩展为多标签框架，联合建模五种疾病，利用共享遗传结构提高效率。

Result: 在37,000样本和五百万SNPs上，方法实现了AUC 0.68-0.96的预测性能，且无数据泄漏。

Conclusion: 该方法为多疾病GWAS分析提供了可扩展、无泄漏且具有生物学意义的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional GWAS has advanced our understanding of complex diseases but often
misses nonlinear genetic interactions. Deep learning offers new opportunities
to capture complex genomic patterns, yet existing methods mostly depend on
feature selection strategies that either constrain analysis to known pathways
or risk data leakage when applied across the full dataset. Further, covariates
can inflate predictive performance without reflecting true genetic signals. We
explore different deep learning architecture choices for GWAS and demonstrate
that careful architectural choices can outperform existing methods under strict
no-leakage conditions. Building on this, we extend our approach to a
multi-label framework that jointly models five diseases, leveraging shared
genetic architecture for improved efficiency and discovery. Applied to five
million SNPs across 37,000 samples, our method achieves competitive predictive
performance (AUC 0.68-0.96), offering a scalable, leakage-free, and
biologically meaningful approach for multi-disease GWAS analysis.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI search engines is disrupting traditional SEO, with
Gartner predicting 25% reduction in conventional search usage by 2026. This
necessitates new approaches for web content visibility in AI-driven search
environments. We present a domain-specific fine-tuning approach for Generative
Engine Optimization (GEO) that transforms web content to improve
discoverability in large language model outputs. Our method fine-tunes a
BART-base transformer on synthetically generated training data comprising 1,905
cleaned travel website content pairs. Each pair consists of raw website text
and its GEO-optimized counterpart incorporating credible citations, statistical
evidence, and improved linguistic fluency. We evaluate using intrinsic metrics
(ROUGE-L, BLEU) and extrinsic visibility assessments through controlled
experiments with Llama-3.3-70B. The fine-tuned model achieves significant
improvements over baseline BART: ROUGE-L scores of 0.249 (vs. 0.226) and BLEU
scores of 0.200 (vs. 0.173). Most importantly, optimized content demonstrates
substantial visibility gains in generative search responses with 15.63%
improvement in absolute word count and 30.96% improvement in position-adjusted
word count metrics. This work provides the first empirical demonstration that
targeted transformer fine-tuning can effectively enhance web content visibility
in generative search engines with modest computational resources. Our results
suggest GEO represents a tractable approach for content optimization in the
AI-driven search landscape, offering concrete evidence that small-scale,
domain-focused fine-tuning yields meaningful improvements in content
discoverability.

Conclusion: LILI聚类有效减少偏差，提升因果推断准确性，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Causal forest methods are powerful tools in causal inference. Similar to
traditional random forest in machine learning, causal forest independently
considers each causal tree. However, this independence consideration increases
the likelihood that classification errors in one tree are repeated in others,
potentially leading to significant bias in causal e ect estimation. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach that establishes connections between causal
trees through the Limit Inferior Leaf Interval (LILI) clustering algorithm.
LILIs are constructed based on the leaves of all causal trees, emphasizing the
similarity of dataset confounders. When two instances with di erent treatments
are grouped into the same leaf across a su cient number of causal trees, they
are treated as counterfactual outcomes of each other. Through this clustering
mechanism, LILI clustering reduces bias present in traditional causal tree
methods and enhances the prediction accuracy for the average treatment e ect
(ATE). By integrating LILIs into a causal forest, we develop an e cient causal
inference method. Moreover, we explore several key properties of LILI by
relating it to the concepts of limit inferior and limit superior in the set
theory. Theoretical analysis rigorously proves the convergence of the estimated
ATE using LILI clustering. Empirically, extensive comparative experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of LILI clustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机试验通常缺乏统计功效来揭示患者特征间的效应异质性，限制了其在个性化决策中的价值。

Method: 提出QR-learner，结合外部数据估计CATE，并引入与试验专用CATE学习器结合的方法。

Result: 模拟研究和实际数据集应用显示，该方法在CATE估计和检测异质性效应的统计功效上均有提升。

Conclusion: QR-learner能有效利用外部数据，提升CATE估计的准确性和统计功效。

Abstract: Randomized trials are typically designed to detect average treatment effects
but often lack the statistical power to uncover effect heterogeneity over
patient characteristics, limiting their value for personalized decision-making.
To address this, we propose the QR-learner, a model-agnostic learner that
estimates conditional average treatment effects (CATE) within the trial
population by leveraging external data from other trials or observational
studies. The proposed method is robust: it has the potential to reduce the CATE
prediction mean squared error while maintaining consistency, even when the
external data is not aligned with the trial. Moreover, we introduce a procedure
that combines the QR-learner with a trial-only CATE learner and show that it
asymptotically matches or exceeds the trial-only learner in terms of mean
squared error. We examine the performance of our approach in simulation studies
and apply the methods to a real-world dataset, demonstrating improvements in
both CATE estimation and statistical power for detecting heterogeneous effects.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel methodology for robustly estimating particle
size distributions from optical scattering measurements using constrained
Gaussian process regression. The estimation of particle size distributions is
commonly formulated as a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, an
ill-posed inverse problem characterized by instability due to measurement noise
and limited data. To address this, we use a Gaussian process prior to
regularize the solution and integrate a normalization constraint into the
Gaussian process via two approaches: by constraining the Gaussian process using
a pseudo-measurement and by using Lagrange multipliers in the equivalent
optimization problem. To improve computational efficiency, we employ a spectral
expansion of the covariance kernel using eigenfunctions of the Laplace
operator, resulting in a computationally tractable low-rank representation
without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we investigate two complementary
strategies for hyperparameter estimation: a data-driven approach based on
maximizing the unconstrained log marginal likelihood, and an alternative
approach where the physical constraints are taken into account. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed constrained Gaussian process
regression framework accurately reconstructs particle size distributions,
producing numerically stable, smooth, and physically interpretable results.
This methodology provides a principled and efficient solution for addressing
inverse scattering problems and related ill-posed integral equations.

Result: 提出了一个基于算法稳定性的理论框架，识别了扩散模型中多种隐式正则化来源。

Conclusion: 通过算法属性而非模型结构，揭示了扩散模型中未被充分研究的正则化机制。

Abstract: The success of denoising diffusion models raises important questions
regarding their generalisation behaviour, particularly in high-dimensional
settings. Notably, it has been shown that when training and sampling are
performed perfectly, these models memorise training data -- implying that some
form of regularisation is essential for generalisation. Existing theoretical
analyses primarily rely on algorithm-independent techniques such as uniform
convergence, heavily utilising model structure to obtain generalisation bounds.
In this work, we instead leverage the algorithmic aspects that promote
generalisation in diffusion models, developing a general theory of
algorithm-dependent generalisation for this setting. Borrowing from the
framework of algorithmic stability, we introduce the notion of score stability,
which quantifies the sensitivity of score-matching algorithms to dataset
perturbations. We derive generalisation bounds in terms of score stability, and
apply our framework to several fundamental learning settings, identifying
sources of regularisation. In particular, we consider denoising score matching
with early stopping (denoising regularisation), sampler-wide coarse
discretisation (sampler regularisation) and optimising with SGD (optimisation
regularisation). By grounding our analysis in algorithmic properties rather
than model structure, we identify multiple sources of implicit regularisation
unique to diffusion models that have so far been overlooked in the literature.

employs a probabilistic approach, with its PAC learning property rigorously
proven through the mathematical theory of functional analysis. The algorithm
dynamically predicts using a learned probability distribution of predictors,
updating weights via gradient descent and a proximal algorithm to maintain a
valid probability density. Inspired by SINDy (Brunton et al. 2016), it
incorporates feature augmentation and Tikhonov regularization. For multivariate
normal weights, the proximal step is omitted to focus on parameter estimation.
The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through experimental results in
regression and binary classification using real-world data.

Motivation: Breiman在25年前提出了数据模型与算法模型的对比，本文旨在通过现代计算能力和新视角重新审视这些观点，并探索更优的实现目标的方法。

Method: 通过分析Breiman提出的'Rashomon效应'和'Occam困境'，结合现代计算能力，探讨了模型简洁性与准确性之间的关系，并提出了新的技术路径。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种超越Breiman'两种文化'的新视角，展示了如何在不牺牲简洁性和准确性的情况下实现因果性和可解释性。

Abstract: In the famous Two Cultures paper, Leo Breiman provided a visionary
perspective on the cultures of ''data models'' (modeling with consideration of
data generation) versus ''algorithmic models'' (vanilla machine learning
models). I provide a modern perspective on these approaches. One of Breiman's
key arguments against data models is the ''Rashomon Effect,'' which is the
existence of many different-but-equally-good models. The Rashomon Effect
implies that data modelers would not be able to determine which model generated
the data. Conversely, one of his core advantages in favor of data models is
simplicity, as he claimed there exists an ''Occam Dilemma,'' i.e., an
accuracy-simplicity tradeoff. After 25 years of powerful computers, it has
become clear that this claim is not generally true, in that algorithmic models
do not need to be complex to be accurate; however, there are nuances that help
explain Breiman's logic, specifically, that by ''simple,'' he appears to
consider only linear models or unoptimized decision trees. Interestingly, the
Rashomon Effect is a key tool in proving the nullification of the Occam
Dilemma. To his credit though, Breiman did not have the benefit of modern
computers, with which my observations are much easier to make.
  Breiman's goal for interpretability was somewhat intertwined with causality:
simpler models can help reveal which variables have a causal relationship with
the outcome. However, I argue that causality can be investigated without the
use of single models, whether or not they are simple. Interpretability is
useful in its own right, and I think Breiman knew that too.
  Technically, my modern perspective does not belong to either of Breiman's Two
Cultures, but shares the goals of both of them - causality, simplicity,
accuracy - and shows that these goals can be accomplished in other ways,
without the limitations Breiman was concerned about.

Motivation: 从大量候选模型中选择最简单的正确模型是一个挑战，传统信息准则（如AIC、BIC）存在局限性。

Method: 提出PASTIS，其惩罚项基于极值理论，考虑了候选参数库的大小、模型参数数量和显著性阈值。

Result: PASTIS在多个系统（如Lorenz、Gray-Scott等）中表现优于AIC、BIC、交叉验证和SINDy。

Conclusion: PASTIS为随机动力学过程提供了一种统计基础扎实、实用且可扩展的模型发现框架。

Abstract: This thesis focuses on the discovery of stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) from noisy and
discrete time series. A major challenge is selecting the simplest possible
correct model from vast libraries of candidate models, where standard
information criteria (AIC, BIC) are often limited.
  We introduce PASTIS (Parsimonious Stochastic Inference), a new information
criterion derived from extreme value theory. Its penalty term, $n_\mathcal{B}
\ln(n_0/p)$, explicitly incorporates the size of the initial library of
candidate parameters ($n_0$), the number of parameters in the considered model
($n_\mathcal{B}$), and a significance threshold ($p$). This significance
threshold represents the probability of selecting a model containing more
parameters than necessary when comparing many models.
  Benchmarks on various systems (Lorenz, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Lotka-Volterra for
SDEs; Gray-Scott for SPDEs) demonstrate that PASTIS outperforms AIC, BIC,
cross-validation (CV), and SINDy (a competing method) in terms of exact model
identification and predictive capability.
  Furthermore, real-world data can be subject to large sampling intervals
($\Delta t$) or measurement noise ($\sigma$), which can impair model learning
and selection capabilities. To address this, we have developed robust variants
of PASTIS, PASTIS-$\Delta t$ and PASTIS-$\sigma$, thus extending the
applicability of the approach to imperfect experimental data.
  PASTIS thus provides a statistically grounded, validated, and practical
methodological framework for discovering simple models for processes with
stochastic dynamics.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has gained widespread adoption in recent
years but faces significant challenges, particularly in unknown and complex
environments. Among these, high-dimensional action selection stands out as a
critical problem. Existing works often require a sophisticated prior design to
eliminate redundancy in the action space, relying heavily on domain expert
experience or involving high computational complexity, which limits their
generalizability across different RL tasks. In this paper, we address these
challenges by proposing a general data-driven action selection approach with
model-free and computationally friendly properties. Our method not only selects
minimal sufficient actions but also controls the false discovery rate via
knockoff sampling. More importantly, we seamlessly integrate the action
selection into deep RL methods during online training. Empirical experiments
validate the established theoretical guarantees, demonstrating that our method
surpasses various alternative techniques in terms of both performance in
variable selection and overall achieved rewards.

Abstract: Theoretical works on supervised transfer learning (STL) -- where the learner
has access to labeled samples from both source and target distributions -- have
for the most part focused on statistical aspects of the problem, while
efficient optimization has received less attention. We consider the problem of
designing an SGD procedure for STL that alternates sampling between source and
target data, while maintaining statistical transfer guarantees without prior
knowledge of the quality of the source data. A main algorithmic difficulty is
in understanding how to design such an adaptive sub-sampling mechanism at each
SGD step, to automatically gain from the source when it is informative, or bias
towards the target and avoid negative transfer when the source is less
informative.
  We show that, such a mixed-sample SGD procedure is feasible for general
prediction tasks with convex losses, rooted in tracking an abstract sequence of
constrained convex programs that serve to maintain the desired transfer
guarantees.
  We instantiate these results in the concrete setting of linear regression
with square loss, and show that the procedure converges, with $1/\sqrt{T}$
rate, to a solution whose statistical performance on the target is adaptive to
the a priori unknown quality of the source. Experiments with synthetic and real
datasets support the theory.

often suffer from slow convergence, while second-order methods achieve fast
local convergence at the expense of costly Hessian inversions. In this paper,
we highlight a middle ground: minimizing a quadratic majorant with fixed
curvature at each iteration. This strategy strikes a balance between
per-iteration cost and convergence speed, and crucially allows the reuse of
matrix decompositions, such as Cholesky or spectral decompositions, across
iterations and varying regularization parameters. We introduce the Quadratic
Majorization Minimization with Extrapolation (QMME) framework and establish its
sequential convergence properties under standard assumptions. The new
perspective of our analysis is to center the arguments around the induced norm
of the curvature matrix $H$. To demonstrate practical advantages, we apply QMME
to large-scale kernel regularized learning problems. In particular, we propose
a novel Sylvester equation modelling technique for kernel multinomial
regression. In Julia-based experiments, QMME compares favorably against various
established first- and second-order methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
our algorithms complement existing kernel approximation techniques through more
efficiently handling sketching matrices with large projection dimensions. Our
numerical experiments and real data analysis are available and fully
reproducible at https://github.com/qhengncsu/QMME.jl.

Abstract: We study the Pareto Set Identification (PSI) problem in a structured
multi-output linear bandit model. In this setting, each arm is associated a
feature vector belonging to $\mathbb{R}^h$, and its mean vector in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ linearly depends on this feature vector through a common unknown
matrix $\Theta \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times d}$. The goal is to identify the set of
non-dominated arms by adaptively collecting samples from the arms. We introduce
and analyze the first optimal design-based algorithms for PSI, providing nearly
optimal guarantees in both the fixed-budget and the fixed-confidence settings.
Notably, we show that the difficulty of these tasks mainly depends on the
sub-optimality gaps of $h$ arms only. Our theoretical results are supported by
an extensive benchmark on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: While continuous diffusion models excel in modeling continuous distributions,
their application to categorical data has been less effective. Recent work has
shown that ratio-matching through score-entropy within a continuous-time
discrete Markov chain (CTMC) framework serves as a competitive alternative to
autoregressive models in language modeling. To enhance this framework, we first
introduce three new theorems concerning the KL divergence between the data and
learned distribution. Our results serve as the discrete counterpart to those
established for continuous diffusion models and allow us to derive an improved
upper bound of the perplexity. Second, we empirically show that ratio-matching
performed by minimizing the denoising cross-entropy between the clean and
corrupted data enables models to outperform those utilizing score-entropy with
up to 10% lower perplexity/generative-perplexity, and 15% faster training
steps. To further support our findings, we introduce and evaluate a novel CTMC
transition-rate matrix that allows prediction refinement, and derive the
analytic expression for its matrix exponential which facilitates the
computation of conditional ratios thus enabling efficient training and
generation.

Abstract: This work aims to estimate the drift and diffusion functions in stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) driven by a particular class of L\'evy processes
with finite jump intensity, using neural networks. We propose a framework that
integrates the Tamed-Milstein scheme with neural networks employed as
non-parametric function approximators. Estimation is carried out in a
non-parametric fashion for the drift function \( f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}
\), the diffusion coefficient \( g: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R} \). The model of
interest is given by \[ dX(t) = \xi + f(X(t))\, dt + g(X(t))\, dW_t + \gamma
\int_{\mathbb{Z}} z\, N(dt,dz), \] where \( W_t \) is a standard Brownian
motion, and \( N(dt,dz) \) is a Poisson random measure on \( (~\mathbb{R}_{+}
~\times ~\mathbb{Z}~, ~\mathcal{B}~(~\mathbb{R}_{+}~)~\otimes~\mathcal{Z}~,~
\lambda( \Lambda~\otimes~v~)~) \), with \( \lambda, \gamma > 0 \), \( \Lambda
\) being the Lebesgue measure on \( \mathbb{R}_{+} \), and \( v \) a finite
measure on the measurable space \( (\mathbb{Z}, \mathcal{Z}) \).
  Neural networks are used as non-parametric function approximators, enabling
the modeling of complex nonlinear dynamics without assuming restrictive
functional forms. The proposed methodology constitutes a flexible alternative
for inference in systems with state-dependent noise and discontinuities driven
by L\'evy processes.

TL;DR: 本文通过范畴论方法分析共形预测（CP），揭示其作为不确定性量化工具的结构特性，并展示其在贝叶斯、频率论和不精确概率方法中的桥梁作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形预测（CP）作为一种不确定性表示技术，其作为不确定性量化工具的概念地位尚不明确，本文旨在通过范畴论方法澄清其本质。

Method: 采用范畴论方法，将CP定义为两个新定义范畴之间的态射，并嵌入交换图中进行分析。

Result: 研究发现CP本质上是一种不确定性量化机制，且其能力是结构性的；CP还能连接贝叶斯、频率论和不精确概率方法；共形预测区域（CPR）是一个协变函子的像。

Conclusion: CP的结构特性使其成为强大的不确定性量化工具，同时在AI隐私保护中，局部添加隐私噪声不会破坏其覆盖性。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an Uncertainty Representation technique that
delivers finite-sample calibrated prediction regions for any underlying Machine
Learning model, yet its status as an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tool has
remained conceptually opaque. We adopt a category-theoretic approach to CP --
framing it as a morphism, embedded in a commuting diagram, of two newly-defined
categories -- that brings us three joys. First, we show that -- under minimal
assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a UQ mechanism, that is, its UQ capabilities
are a structural feature of the method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges
(and perhaps subsumes) the Bayesian, frequentist, and imprecise probabilistic
approaches to predictive statistical reasoning. Finally, we show that a
conformal prediction region (CPR) is the image of a covariant functor. This
observation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added
locally does not break coverage.

Conclusion: CROiMS在温和假设下实现了渐近条件鲁棒性和决策效率，推动了协变量感知模型选择的发展。

Abstract: In decision-making under uncertainty, Contextual Robust Optimization (CRO)
provides reliability by minimizing the worst-case decision loss over a
prediction set, hedging against label variability. While recent advances use
conformal prediction to construct prediction sets for machine learning models,
the downstream decisions critically depend on model selection. This paper
introduces novel model selection frameworks for CRO that unify robustness
control with decision risk minimization. We first propose Conformalized Robust
Optimization with Model Selection (CROMS), which automatically selects models
to approximately minimize the average decision risk in CRO solutions. We
develop two algorithms: E-CROMS, which is computationally efficient, and
F-CROMS, which enjoys a marginal robustness guarantee in finite samples.
Further, we introduce Conformalized Robust Optimization with Individualized
Model Selection (CROiMS), which performs individualized model selection by
minimizing the conditional decision risk given the covariate of test data. This
framework advances conformal prediction methodology by enabling covariate-aware
model selection. Theoretically, CROiMS achieves asymptotic conditional
robustness and decision efficiency under mild assumptions. Numerical results
demonstrate significant improvements in decision efficiency and robustness
across diverse synthetic and real-world applications, outperforming baseline
approaches.

Conclusion: 新方法成功平衡了表达性与结构学习，为生成模型提供了更灵活的设计思路。

Abstract: In designing generative models, it is commonly believed that in order to
learn useful latent structure, we face a fundamental tension between
expressivity and structure. In this paper we challenge this view by proposing a
new approach to training arbitrarily expressive generative models that
simultaneously learn disentangled latent structure. This is accomplished by
adding a simple decoder-only module to the head of an existing decoder block
that can be arbitrarily complex. The module learns to process concept
information by implicitly inverting linear representations from an encoder.
Inspired by the notion of intervention in causal graphical models, our module
selectively modifies its architecture during training, allowing it to learn a
compact joint model over different contexts. We show how adding this module
leads to disentangled representations that can be composed for
out-of-distribution generation. To further validate our proposed approach, we
prove a new identifiability result that extends existing work on identifying
structured representations in nonlinear models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种新型神经网络模型01Neuro，旨在解决传统模型在通用逼近和训练稳定性上的不足，特别是在处理交互项和噪声特征时的表现。

Method: 基于指示器激活神经元构建01Neuro模型，引入增强版本以实现确定性收敛和构造性通用逼近，并结合随机训练和bagging提升稳定性。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上，01Neuro能有效逼近交互项，预测稳定性与随机森林相当，对噪声特征和特征缩放不敏感，但计算成本较高。

Conclusion: 01Neuro在中小规模数据集上表现出色，但需进一步优化计算效率以提升实用性。

Abstract: We propose a new neural network model, 01Neuro, built on indicator activation
neurons. Its boosted variant possesses two key statistical properties: (1) Sure
Convergence, where model optimization can be achieved with high probability
given sufficient computational resources; and (2) Constructive Universal
Approximation: In the infinite sample setting, the model can approximate any
finite sum of measurable functions, each depending on only k out of p input
features, provided the architecture is properly tuned. Unlike most universal
approximation results that are agnostic to training procedures, our guarantees
are directly tied to the model's explicit construction and optimization
algorithm. To improve prediction stability, we integrate stochastic training
and bagging into the boosted 01Neuro framework. Empirical evaluations on
simulated and real-world tabular datasets with small to medium sample sizes
highlight its strengths: effective approximation of interaction components
(multiplicative terms), stable prediction performance (comparable to Random
Forests), robustness to many noisy features, and insensitivity to feature
scaling. A major limitation of the current implementation of boosted 01Neuro is
its higher computational cost, which is approximately 5 to 30 times that of
Random Forests and XGBoost.

Method: 结合全局诱导点和局部Vecchia近似，采用基于相关性的邻居查找策略，并扩展到非高斯似然。

Result: VIF方法在计算效率和准确性上优于现有方法，且数值稳定性更高。

Conclusion: VIF方法为高斯过程在大规模数据上的应用提供了高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian processes are flexible, probabilistic, non-parametric models widely
used in machine learning and statistics. However, their scalability to large
data sets is limited by computational constraints. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Vecchia-inducing-points full-scale (VIF) approximations
combining the strengths of global inducing points and local Vecchia
approximations. Vecchia approximations excel in settings with low-dimensional
inputs and moderately smooth covariance functions, while inducing point methods
are better suited to high-dimensional inputs and smoother covariance functions.
Our VIF approach bridges these two regimes by using an efficient
correlation-based neighbor-finding strategy for the Vecchia approximation of
the residual process, implemented via a modified cover tree algorithm. We
further extend our framework to non-Gaussian likelihoods by introducing
iterative methods that substantially reduce computational costs for training
and prediction by several orders of magnitudes compared to Cholesky-based
computations when using a Laplace approximation. In particular, we propose and
compare novel preconditioners and provide theoretical convergence results.
Extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real-world data sets show that
VIF approximations are both computationally efficient as well as more accurate
and numerically stable than state-of-the-art alternatives. All methods are
implemented in the open source C++ library GPBoost with high-level Python and R
interfaces.
