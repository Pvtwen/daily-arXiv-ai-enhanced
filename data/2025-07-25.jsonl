This work\nfocuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and\ncarrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for\nlocating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances\nchannel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an\nexisting multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot\n(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix\n(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs\ndifferent Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via\ncorrelation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a\ncorrelation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot\nstructure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is\nproposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the\ndelay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO\nestimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'\nsignals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical\nthreshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major\npeak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest\npeak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the\nproposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique\nreduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into\nmultiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to\neffectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO\nestimates for all the users."}

However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers.

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset.

We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph\nAugmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and\nPseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling\nmethod to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority\nnodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we\ndevelop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence\npseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a\nsecondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class\ndistribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that\nGraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on\nclass-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels."}

This urgency is reflected by\nthe global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate\ntesting, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the\nnecessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.\nParticularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the\ncollection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and\nauditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.\nFurther, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative\nto identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier\nfairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We\npropose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete\nsynthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects\nthe underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.\nWe validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,\nand empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such\nsynthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,\ntherefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness\ntesting, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and\nserving as a viable substitute where real data is limited."}

Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant\nnetwork architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects\n(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these\nmethods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,\nrequiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)\ninvariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to\nthe number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer\narchitecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large\nlanguage models in recent years.

Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models\nhave shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.\nHowever, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de\nnovo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.\nConsidering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level\nstructures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that\nintegrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient\nend-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating\nrepresentations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can\neffectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,\nresulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated\nprotein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to\nevaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.\nOur new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional\nsimilarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring\nconditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the\nresults on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the\nproposed generation framework and evaluation metric."}

Existing\nadaptive ensemble methods often rely on coarse-grained adaptation mechanisms or\nsimple voting schemes that fail to optimally leverage specialized knowledge.\nThis paper introduces DriftMoE, an online Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture\nthat addresses these limitations through a novel co-training framework.\nDriftMoE features a compact neural router that is co-trained alongside a pool\nof incremental Hoeffding tree experts. The key innovation lies in a symbiotic\nlearning loop that enables expert specialization: the router selects the most\nsuitable expert for prediction, the relevant experts update incrementally with\nthe true label, and the router refines its parameters using a multi-hot\ncorrectness mask that reinforces every accurate expert. This feedback loop\nprovides the router with a clear training signal while accelerating expert\nspecialization. We evaluate DriftMoE's performance across nine state-of-the-art\ndata stream learning benchmarks spanning abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts\ntesting two distinct configurations: one where experts specialize on data\nregimes (multi-class variant), and another where they focus on single-class\nspecialization (task-based variant).
