Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a crucial role in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) and neurological diagnostics, but its real-world deployment
faces challenges due to noise artifacts, missing data, and high annotation
costs. We introduce SSL-SE-EEG, a framework that integrates Self-Supervised
Learning (SSL) with Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SE-Nets) to enhance
feature extraction, improve noise robustness, and reduce reliance on labeled

signals into structured 2D image representations, suitable for deep learning.
Experimental validation on MindBigData, TUH-AB, SEED-IV and BCI-IV datasets
demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy (91% in MindBigData, 85% in TUH-AB),
making it well-suited for real-time BCI applications. By enabling low-power,
scalable EEG processing, SSL-SE-EEG presents a promising solution for
biomedical signal analysis, neural engineering, and next-generation BCIs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 侵入式脑机接口虽然精度高但手术风险大，非侵入式EEG方法更安全但信号质量差。需要开发既能保持高精度又能在便携设备上实时运行的非侵入式BCI系统。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a pathway to restore communication for
individuals with severe motor or speech impairments. Imagined handwriting
provides an intuitive paradigm for character-level neural decoding, bridging
the gap between human intention and digital communication. While invasive
approaches such as electrocorticography (ECoG) achieve high accuracy, their
surgical risks limit widespread adoption. Non-invasive electroencephalography
(EEG) offers safer and more scalable alternatives but suffers from low
signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, constraining its decoding
precision. This work demonstrates that advanced machine learning combined with
informative EEG feature extraction can overcome these barriers, enabling
real-time, high-accuracy neural decoding on portable edge devices. A 32-channel
EEG dataset was collected from fifteen participants performing imagined
handwriting. Signals were preprocessed with bandpass filtering and artifact
subspace reconstruction, followed by extraction of 85 time-, frequency-, and
graphical-domain features. A hybrid architecture, EEdGeNet, integrates a
Temporal Convolutional Network with a multilayer perceptron trained on the
extracted features. When deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2, the system achieved
89.83 percent accuracy with 914.18 ms per-character latency. Selecting only ten
key features reduced latency by 4.5 times to 202.6 ms with less than 1 percent
loss in accuracy. These results establish a pathway for accurate, low-latency,
and fully portable non-invasive BCIs supporting real-time communication.

Abstract: Accurate modulation classification is a core challenge in cognitive radio,
adaptive communications, spectrum analysis, and related domains, especially
under dynamic channels without transmitter knowledge. To address this need,
this article presents a labeled synthetic dataset designed for wireless
modulation classification under realistic propagation scenarios. The signals
were generated in MATLAB by modulating randomly generated bitstreams using five
digital modulation schemes: BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 256-QAM. These
signals were then transmitted through Rayleigh and Rician fading channels with
standardized parameters, along with additional impairments to enhance realism
and diversity. Each modulated signal contains 1000 symbols. A comprehensive set
of features was extracted from the signals, encompassing statistical,
time-domain, frequency-domain, spectrogram-based, spectral correlation-based,
and image-processing-based descriptors such as BRISK, MSER, and GLCM. The
dataset is organized into 10 CSV files covering two channel types (Rayleigh and
Rician) across five sampling frequencies: 1 MHz, 10 MHz, 100 MHz, 500 MHz, and
1 GHz. To facilitate reproducibility and encourage further experimentation, the
MATLAB scripts used for signal generation and feature extraction are also
provided. This dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for developing and
evaluating machine learning models in modulation classification, signal
identification, and wireless communication research.

consumption of 7.69 uJ per inference, 18x more efficient than the
state-of-the-art, NanoHydra is suitable for smart wearable devices, enabling a
device lifetime of over four years.

### [5] [Semantic Communication for Task Execution and Data Reconstruction in Multi-User Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20067)
*Maximilian H. V. Tillmann,Avinash Kankari,Carsten Bockelmann,Armin Dekorsy*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种多用户语义通信系统，同时优化任务执行和数据重建两个目标，通过互信息最大化框架实现性能平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义通信系统大多只关注任务执行或数据重建单一目标，缺乏对两者协同优化的研究，特别是在多用户场景下需要平衡不同需求。

Method: 将任务执行和数据重建联合目标表述为互信息最大化问题，使用SSIM损失函数考虑人类视觉感知，通过凸组合权重调整两个目标的权衡。

Result: 在固定资源条件下，适当增加重建目标的权重可以在保持任务执行性能基本不变的同时，显著提升数据重建质量。

Conclusion: 提出的联合优化框架能够有效平衡语义通信中的任务执行和数据重建需求，为多用户场景提供了实用的性能权衡方案。

Abstract: Semantic communication has gained significant attention with the advances in
machine learning. Most semantic communication works focus on either task
execution or data reconstruction, with some recent works combining the two. In
this work, we propose a semantic communication system for concurrent task
execution and data reconstruction for a multi-user scenario, which we formulate
as the maximization of mutual information. To investigate the trade-off between
the two objectives, we formulate a joint objective as a convex combination of
task execution and data reconstruction. We show that under specific
assumptions, the \ac{SSIM} loss can be obtained from the mutual information
maximization objective for data reconstruction, which takes human visual
perception into account. Furthermore, for constant resource use, we show that
by increasing the weight of the reconstruction objective up to a certain point,
the task execution performance can be kept nearly constant, while the data
reconstruction can be significantly improved.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文设计、实现并评估了一个基于RIS的O-RAN 5G系统，在毫米波频段通过可重构智能表面增强信号覆盖和信噪比，并开发了移动性管理算法来应对用户设备移动性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用RIS将电磁波重定向到期望方向，以增强信号覆盖和改善用户设备的信噪比，同时解决RIS辅助系统中用户设备移动性管理的挑战。

Method: 设计了1,024元素（32×32）1位RIS，采用模块化可扩展的瓦片架构；利用O-RAN E2接口动态控制RIS配置；开发了两种UE移动性管理算法，利用UE接收信号功率实时联合跟踪和调整RIS与UE波束。

Conclusion: 将RIS集成到O-RAN系统中在增强覆盖、支持移动性和提高链路可靠性方面具有实际可行性，为下一代蜂窝网络提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) can redirect electromagnetic waves
to desired directions to enhance signal coverage and/or improve signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) at the user equipment (UE). We present the design, implementation,
and evaluation of an RIS-assisted O-RAN 5G system operating in the FR2
millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band. We first introduce the design of 1,024
element (32 $\times$ 32) 1-bit RIS operating at the 28 GHz band, utilizing a
modular and scalable tiled architecture. Then we demonstrate how the O-RAN E2
interface can be leveraged to dynamically control RIS configurations without
modifying standard 5G signaling procedures. To evaluate the RIS-assisted 5G
system, we conducted extensive field trials in both indoor and outdoor
environments. The results of the O-RAN link coverage trials show that the
deployed RIS provides substantial received signal power gains, ranging from 9
to 20 dB and 6 to 18 dB in indoor and outdoors scenarios, respectively.
Handling UE mobility in RIS-assisted systems is challenging due to the need for
joint RIS and UE beam management. For that, we develop two UE mobility
management algorithms and evaluate them in real-time operation using the RIS
O-RAN testbed. These algorithms leverage the received signal power at the UE to
jointly track and adapt the RIS and UE beams in real time as the UE moves. The
findings draw important insights into the practical feasibility of integrating
RIS into O-RAN systems to enhance coverage, mobility support, and link
reliability in next-generation cellular networks.

Main category: eess.SP

Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) offers significant advantages in
managing mobility for both wireless sensing and communication systems, making
it a promising candidate for dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC).
However, the optimal signal design that fully exploits OTFS's potential in DFRC
has not been sufficiently explored. This paper addresses this gap by
formulating an optimization problem for signal design in DFRC-OTFS,
incorporating both pilot-symbol design for channel estimation and data-power
allocation. Specifically, we employ the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) of the
ambiguity function as a radar metric, accounting for the randomness of the data
symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. For communication, we derive
a channel capacity lower bound metric that considers channel estimation errors
in OTFS. We maximize the weighted sum of sensing and communication metrics and
solve the optimization problem via an alternating optimization framework.
Simulations indicate that the proposed signal significantly improves the
sensing-communication performance region compared with conventional signal
schemes, achieving at least a 9.44 dB gain in ISL suppression for sensing, and
a 4.82 dB gain in the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for
communication.

Abstract: Underwater data infrastructures offer natural cooling and enhanced physical
security compared to terrestrial facilities, but are susceptible to acoustic
injection attacks that can disrupt data integrity and availability. This work
presents a comprehensive surveillance framework for localizing and tracking
close-range adversarial acoustic sources targeting offshore infrastructures,
particularly underwater data centers (UDCs). We propose a heterogeneous
receiver configuration comprising a fixed hydrophone mounted on the facility
and a mobile hydrophone deployed on a dedicated surveillance robot. While using
enough arrays of static hydrophones covering large infrastructures is not
feasible in practice, off-the-shelf approaches based on time difference of
arrival (TDOA) and frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) filtering fail to
generalize for this dynamic configuration. To address this, we formulate a
Locus-Conditioned Maximum A-Posteriori (LC-MAP) scheme to generate acoustically
informed and geometrically consistent priors, ensuring a physically plausible
initial state for a joint TDOA-FDOA filtering. We integrate this into an
unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) pipeline, which provides reliable convergence
under nonlinearity and measurement noise. Extensive Monte Carlo analyses,
Gazebo-based physics simulations, and field trials demonstrate that the
proposed framework can reliably estimate the 3D position and velocity of an
adversarial acoustic attack source in real time. It achieves sub-meter
localization accuracy and over 90% success rates, with convergence times nearly
halved compared to baseline methods. Overall, this study establishes a
geometry-aware, real-time approach for acoustic threat localization, advancing
autonomous surveillance capabilities of underwater infrastructures.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种在近场ISAC场景中利用已知散射体进行位置欺骗的方案，通过向散射体分配更高功率来误导窃听者，无需窃听者先验信息即可实现目标检测欺骗。

Motivation: 在ISAC系统中保护感知安全，防止具有感知能力的窃听者正确识别目标位置，利用已知散射体作为欺骗手段。

Conclusion: 所提出的位置欺骗方案能有效提升ISAC系统的感知安全性，在不需窃听者先验信息的情况下实现目标检测欺骗。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore sensing security in near-field (NF) integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios by exploiting known scatterers in
the sensing scene. We propose a location deception (LD) scheme where scatterers
are deliberately illuminated with probing power that is higher than that
directed toward targets of interest, with the goal of deceiving potential
eavesdroppers (Eves) with sensing capability into misidentifying scatterers as
targets. While the known scatterers can be removed at the legitimate sensing
receiver, our LD approach causes Eves to misdetect targets. Notably, this
deception is achieved without requiring any prior information about the Eves'
characteristics or locations. To strike a flexible three-way tradeoff among
communication, sensing, and sensing-security performance, the sum rate and
power allocated to scatterers are weighted and maximized under a legitimate
radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint. We employ the
fractional programming (FP) framework and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to
solve this problem. To evaluate the security of the proposed LD scheme, the
Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) and mean squared error (MSE) metrics are employed.
Additionally, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) gap between
targets and scatterers at Eve to quantify the impact of the proposed LD
framework on Eve's sensing performance from an information-theoretical
perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LD scheme can
flexibly adjust the beamforming strategy according to performance requirements,
thereby achieving the desired three-way tradeoff. In particular, in terms of
sensing security, the proposed scheme significantly enhances the clutter signal
strength at Eve's side, leading to confusion or even missed detection of the
actual target.

Abstract: The cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO) is a promising
technology for the six generation (6G) communication systems. Channel
prediction will play an important role in obtaining the accurate CSI to improve
the performance of CF-mMIMO systems. This paper studies a deep learning (DL)
based joint space-time-frequency domain channel prediction for CF-mMIMO.
Firstly, the prediction problems are formulated, which can output the
multi-step prediction results in parallel without error propagation. Then, a
novel channel prediction model is proposed, which adds frequency convolution
(FreqConv) and space convolution (SpaceConv) layers to Transformer-encoder. It
is able to utilize the space-time-frequency correlations and extract the space
correlation in the irregular AP deployment. Next, simulated datasets with
different sizes of service areas, UE velocities and scenarios are generated,
and correlation analysis and cross-validation are used to determine the optimal
hyper-parameters. According to the optimized hyper-parameters, the prediction
accuracy and computational complexity are evaluated based on simulated
datasets. It is indicated that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is
higher than traditional model, and its computational complexity is lower than
traditional Transformer model. After that, the impacts of space-time-frequency
correlations on prediction accuracy are studied. Finally, realistic datasets in
a high-speed train (HST) long-term evolution (LTE) network are collected to
verify the prediction accuracy. The verification results demonstrate that it
also achieves higher prediction accuracy compared with traditional models in
the HST LTE network.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文综述了可见光通信(VLC)在6G网络中的潜力，重点探讨了非正交多址接入(NOMA)技术在VLC系统中的应用前景和挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络对高速数据传输的需求推动了对VLC技术的探索。现有标准未能充分利用光的特性，且VLC链路的不对称性使传统TDMA协议效率低下，需要重新设计MAC层协议。

Method: 通过分析VLC系统的光学特性、链路不对称性和方向性特点，评估NOMA技术在VLC中的适用性，并调研相关优化约束、目标和应用场景。

Result: 研究发现NOMA技术能让多个用户在相同时间和频率资源上共享，同时容忍可控干扰，在VLC系统中具有显著优势，特别是在处理突发和非对称流量方面。

Conclusion: NOMA是VLC系统中很有前景的多址接入技术，需要进一步研究其在6G VLC网络中的具体实现和优化方法。

Abstract: Rapidly increasing demand for high speed data is pushing 6G wireless networks
to support larger link scales, lower latency, and higher spectral efficiency.
Visible light communications (VLC) is a strong complement to radio frequency
(RF) systems within 6G. The latest ITU G.9991 and IEEE 802.11bb standards are
adapted from cable and RF wireless technologies for use in VLC, so they do not
fully exploit the optical nature of light links. VLC links are often asymmetric
between uplink and downlink, which makes TDMA style protocols inefficient when
many users generate bursty and asymmetric traffic. Compared with RF, the strong
directionality and frequent line of sight in VLC can mitigate hidden and
exposed terminals, yet these effects can still appear under limited field of
view, blockage, or reflections. CSMA/CA and related methods remain usable in
VLC and in RF plus VLC networks, but they usually need design tweaks such as
RTS/CTS or directional sensing to perform well. Although the optical spectrum
is vast, the bandwidth of practical LEDs and of common PIN or APD receivers is
limited, so efficient multiple access can yield large gains. This motivates a
clean slate design for VLC, especially at the MAC layer. NOMA, first explored
in 5G RF systems, is also promising for 6G VLC. It lets multiple users share
the same time and frequency resources while tolerating controlled interference.
This paper reviews progress in VLC and in NOMA based VLC, outlines key
optimization constraints and objectives, surveys scenarios that fit NOMA in
VLC, and points to several directions for future work.

Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a two-dimensional modulation
technique that uses the delay-Doppler (DD) domain and is a candidate for
providing robust, high-capacity wireless communications for envisioned 6G and
beyond networks. The OTFS technique maps data to the DD domain instead of the
traditional time-frequency domain, enabling it to fully utilize channel
diversity and transform fast time-varying channels into nearly static channels.
Index modulation (IM) is a communication paradigm that conveys information not
only through conventional modulation symbols but also by encoding data bits in
the indices of the selected communication resources to improve error
performance, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency. In this survey, a
comprehensive review of work on OTFS-based wireless communication systems is
presented. In particular, the existing OTFS-IM schemes are reviewed and
systematically categorized according to their system architectures, detection
methods, and performance aspects such as capacity, peak-to-average power ratio,
diversity, complexity, imperfect channel state information, spectral
efficiency, and outage probability. Furthermore, the operating principles and
system models of OTFS-IM variants-including OTFS-based space shift keying,
OTFS-based spatial modulation, OTFS-based quadrature spatial modulation,
OTFS-based media-based modulation, and OTFS-based code index modulation-are
described, followed by a comparative performance analysis in terms of
computational complexity, error performance, capacity, energy saving, spectral
efficiency, and throughput. Finally, the challenges, benefits, and future
directions for OTFS-IM systems are discussed, covering key aspects such as
complexity, efficiency, latency, channel estimation, hardware constraints,
synchronization, security, and potential integration with other advanced
wireless communication techniques.

Abstract: Conditional differential entropy provides an intuitive measure for relatively
ranking time-series complexity by quantifying uncertainty in future
observations given past context. However, its direct computation for
high-dimensional processes from unknown distributions is often intractable.
This paper builds on the information theoretic prediction error bounds
established by Fang et al. \cite{fang2019generic}, which demonstrate that the
conditional differential entropy \textbf{$h(X_k \mid X_{k-1},...,X_{k-m})$} is
upper bounded by a function of the determinant of the covariance matrix of
next-step prediction errors for any next step prediction model. We add to this
theoretical framework by further increasing this bound by leveraging Hadamard's
inequality and the positive semi-definite property of covariance matrices.
  To see if these bounds can be used to rank the complexity of time series, we
conducted two synthetic experiments: (1) controlled linear autoregressive
processes with additive Gaussian noise, where we compare ordinary least squares
prediction error entropy proxies to the true entropies of various additive
noises, and (2) a complexity ranking task of bio-inspired synthetic audio data
with unknown entropy, where neural network prediction errors are used to
recover the known complexity ordering.
  This framework provides a computationally tractable method for time-series
complexity ranking using prediction errors from next-step prediction models,
that maintains a theoretical foundation in information theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在近场场景下，XL-MIMO的上行链路信道具有满列秩特性，现有的远场或单天线用户近场码本无法有效估计，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 三阶段算法：1) 分区使用OMP和DFT字典估计子阵列信道；2) 利用MUSIC和LS准则估计用户阵列中心位置；3) 构建位置辅助字典矩阵，使用SBL进行MIMO信道估计。

Conclusion: 该三阶段算法成功解决了近场XL-MIMO多天线用户场景下的信道估计和定位问题，为大规模MIMO系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the design of channel estimation and 3D localization
algorithms in a challenging scenario, where a sub-connected planar extremely
large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communicates with
multi-antenna users. In the near field, the uplink MIMO channel is of full
column rank and therefore can not be estimated effectively by applying existing
codebooks that are designed for the far-field case or for the near-field case
but limited to single antenna users. To solve this problem, we propose a
three-stage algorithm aided by orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and sparse
Bayesian learning (SBL). Specifically, we firstly partition the XL-MIMO into
subarrays and use OMP to solve the compressed sensing (CS) problem about
subarray channel estimation with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based
dictionary matrix. Secondly, exploiting the estimated subarray channels and
employing one-dimensional multiple signal classification (MUSIC), we estimate
the central location of the user array under the Least Squares (LS) criterion.
Finally, we utilize the estimated central location to construct a refined
location-aided dictionary matrix and obtain the MIMO channel estimation using
SBL. Results exhibit the significant superiority of the proposed algorithm
compared with several benchmarks, in terms of both the pilot overhead and
estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Pixel-based reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) employ a novel design
to achieve high reflection gain at a lower hardware cost by eliminating the
phase shifters used in traditional RIS. However, this design presents
challenges for channel estimation and passive beamforming due to its
non-separable state response, rendering existing solutions ineffective. To
address this, we first approximate the non-separable RIS response functions
using a kernel-based method and a deep neural network, achieving high accuracy
while reducing computational and memory complexity. Next, we propose a
simplified cascaded channel model that focuses on dominated scattering paths
with limited unknown parameters, along with customized algorithms to estimate
short-term and long-term parameters separately. Finally, we introduce a
low-complexity passive beamforming algorithm to configure the discrete RIS
state vector, maximizing the achievable rate. Our simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly outperforms various
baselines across a wide SNR range.

Motivation: 解决MIMO系统中传统检测方法在高阶调制和复杂信道条件下性能不足的问题，同时保持计算复杂度可控。

Method: 将每个传输层作为token，直接从估计的信道矩阵生成查询和键，注意力分数量化信道相关性，值由匹配滤波器输出初始化并迭代优化。

Abstract: We present AttDet, a Transformer-inspired MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple

TL;DR: 该论文比较了两种工业M2M网络中的MAC协议：基于竞争窗口的BoP-MAC和基于分段的FROG-MAC，发现在多优先级异构数据环境下，FROG-MAC在延迟和吞吐量方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业M2M网络需要低延迟和可靠通信，特别是在存在多优先级数据的高风险环境中。过去十年开发了数十种MAC方案，需要全面比较以了解各协议的相对优势和局限性。

Method: 在Contiki平台上进行仿真，通过改变节点数量来比较BoP-MAC和FROG-MAC两种协议。BoP-MAC为多优先级流量分配差异化退避值，而FROG-MAC通过分段低优先级流量实现高优先级数据包的早期传输。

Result: 仿真结果表明，在工业环境的多优先级异构数据处理中，FROG-MAC在延迟和吞吐量方面表现优于BoP-MAC。

Conclusion: 对于工业环境中的多优先级异构数据通信，基于分段的FROG-MAC协议在性能上优于基于竞争窗口的BoP-MAC协议。

Abstract: Efficient medium access control (MAC) is critical for enabling low-latency
and reliable communication in industrial Machine-to-Machine (M2M) net-works,
where timely data delivery is essential for seamless operation. The presence of
multi-priority data in high-risk industrial environments further adds to the
challenges. The development of tens of MAC schemes over the past decade often
makes it a tough choice to deploy the most efficient solu-tion. Therefore, a
comprehensive cross-comparison of major MAC protocols across a range of
performance parameters appears necessary to gain deeper insights into their
relative strengths and limitations. This paper presents a comparison of
Contention window-based MAC scheme BoP-MAC with a fragmentation based,
FROG-MAC; both protocols focus on reducing the delay for higher priority
traffic, while taking a diverse approach. BoP-MAC assigns a differentiated
back-off value to the multi-priority traffic, whereas FROG-MAC enables early
transmission of higher-priority packets by fragmenting lower-priority traffic.
Simulations were performed on Contiki by varying the number of nodes for two
traffic priorities. It has been shown that when work-ing with multi-priority
heterogenous data in the industrial environment, FROG-MAC results better both
in terms of delay and throughput.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在压缩估计框架下的集成感知与通信系统中，通过最大化判别增益而非最小化均方误差来提升推理性能的方法，提出了水填充结构的优化设计，在低信噪比下实现更高效的功率分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ISAC系统设计通常以最小化均方误差为目标，但实际应用中推理性能是更关键的指标。本文旨在探索通过最大化判别增益是否能比最小化MSE获得更好的推理性能。

Method: 采用压缩估计框架，将推理性能表征为判别增益的单调函数，推导出DG最优和MSE最优收发器设计的闭式解，揭示了水填充型结构和明确的感知与通信权衡。

Result: 数值实验表明，DG最优设计在低信噪比下实现了更高效的功率传输，通过选择性地将功率分配给信息特征来节省感知传输功率。

Conclusion: 最大化判别增益相比最小化均方误差能获得更好的推理性能，特别是在低信噪比场景下，DG最优设计提供了更有效的功率分配策略。

Abstract: This work is concerned with the coordination gain in integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) systems under a compress-and-estimate (CE) framework,
wherein inference performance is leveraged as the key metric. To enable
tractable transceiver design and resource optimization, we characterize
inference performance via an error probability bound as a monotonic function of
the discriminant gain (DG). This raises the natural question of whether
maximizing DG, rather than minimizing mean squared error (MSE), can yield
better inference performance. Closed-form solutions for DG-optimal and
MSE-optimal transceiver designs are derived, revealing water-filling-type
structures and explicit sensing and communication (S\&C) tradeoff. Numerical
experiments confirm that DG-optimal design achieves more power-efficient
transmission, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, by
selectively allocating power to informative features and thus saving transmit
power for sensing.

Motivation: 当前DMA设计和模型通常是准窄带的，忽略了多功能的频率多样性表现及其利用，需要探索DMA的色散特性和频率多样性操作。

Method: 通过动态全息可重构性操控DMA中超原子的色散特性，在操作频带内创建不同的辐射模式，实现灵活的频率多样性。

Result: 实现了增强的扫描范围和灵活的频率多样性，消除了对宽带系统或复杂移相网络的需求，为传统漏波天线的频率扫描静态波束提供了替代方案。

Conclusion: 研究结果为下一代近场和远场全息传感以及计算全息成像应用中DMA色散效应的建模和利用提供了基本见解。

Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) represent a novel approach to
programmable and affordable electromagnetic wave manipulation for enhanced
wireless communications, sensing, and imaging applications. Nevertheless,
current DMA designs and models are usually quasi-narrowband, neglecting the
versatile frequency-diverse manifestation and its utilization. This work
demonstrates the frequency-diversity and dispersion operations of a
representative DMA structure at the millimeter-wave band. We demonstrate
flexible dispersion manipulation through dynamic holographic reconfigurability
of the meta-atoms in a DMA. This effect can create distinct radiation patterns
across the operating frequency band, achieving flexible frequency diversity
with enhanced scanning range within a compact, reconfigurable platform. It
eliminates the need for wideband systems or complex phase-shifting networks
while offering an alternative to frequency-scanned static beams of traditional
leaky-wave antennas. The results establish fundamental insights into modelling
and utilization of dispersive effects of DMAs in next-generation near-field and
far-field holographic sensing and computational holographic imaging
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于块坐标下降框架的高并行算法A-MMMSE，用于多用户MIMO系统的预编码设计，避免了矩阵求逆，仅使用矩阵乘法，适合GPU加速，性能与WMMSE相当但计算时间大幅减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WMMSE算法由于矩阵求逆导致计算复杂度高（基站天线数的三次方），难以在延迟敏感场景中应用，需要开发更高效的计算方法。

Method: 采用块坐标梯度下降更新预编码矩阵，避免矩阵求逆，仅依赖矩阵乘法；引入基于和均方误差最小化问题的两阶段预热策略加速收敛。

Result: 仿真结果表明A-MMMSE在加权和速率性能上与WMMSE及其增强变体reduced-WMMSE相当，同时在多种系统配置下显著减少计算时间。

Conclusion: 提出的A-MMMSE算法通过避免矩阵求逆和利用GPU并行计算，在保持性能的同时大幅降低了计算复杂度，适用于延迟敏感的MIMO系统。

Abstract: Precoding design based on weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization is a
fundamental problem in downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) systems. While the weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)
algorithm is a standard solution, its high computational complexity--cubic in
the number of base station antennas due to matrix inversions--hinders its
application in latency-sensitive scenarios. To address this limitation, we
propose a highly parallel algorithm based on a block coordinate descent
framework. Our key innovation lies in updating the precoding matrix via block
coordinate gradient descent, which avoids matrix inversions and relies solely
on matrix multiplications, making it exceptionally amenable to GPU
acceleration. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary
point of the WSR maximization problem. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage
warm-start strategy grounded in the sum mean-square error (MSE) minimization
problem to accelerate convergence. We refer to our method as the Accelerated
Mixed weighted-unweighted sum-MSE minimization (A-MMMSE) algorithm. Simulation
results demonstrate that A-MMMSE matches the WSR performance of both
conventional WMMSE and its enhanced variant, reduced-WMMSE, while achieving a
substantial reduction in computational time across diverse system
configurations.

Result: 数值结果验证了分析的准确性，并展示了关键参数对LEO-SSCN性能的影响。

Conclusion: 所提出的理论框架为大规模LEO卫星辅助岸到船通信网络的性能评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks have shown strategic superiority in
maritime communications, assisting in establishing signal transmissions from
shore to ship through space-based links. Traditional performance modeling based
on multiple circular orbits is challenging to characterize large-scale LEO
satellite constellations, thus requiring a tractable approach to accurately
evaluate the network performance. In this paper, we propose a theoretical
framework for an LEO satellite-aided shore-to-ship communication network
(LEO-SSCN), where LEO satellites are distributed as a binomial point process
(BPP) on a specific spherical surface. The framework aims to obtain the
end-to-end transmission performance by considering signal transmissions through
either a marine link or a space link subject to Rician or Shadowed Rician
fading, respectively. Due to the indeterminate position of the serving
satellite, accurately modeling the distance from the serving satellite to the
destination ship becomes intractable. To address this issue, we propose a
distance approximation approach. Then, by approximation and incorporating a
threshold-based communication scheme, we leverage stochastic geometry to derive
analytical expressions of end-to-end transmission success probability and
average transmission rate capacity. Extensive numerical results verify the
accuracy of the analysis and demonstrate the effect of key parameters on the
performance of LEO-SSCN.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个工业启发的基准环境，将排序和压缩操作结合到顺序回收场景中，评估模块化与整体控制策略以及动作掩码的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业过程控制需要局部专业化和全局协调，但强化学习在工业应用中的采用受到奖励设计、模块化和动作空间管理等挑战的限制。现有学术基准与工业控制问题差异较大，限制了其向实际应用的转移。

Method: 构建结合SortingEnv和ContainerGym任务的顺序回收场景基准环境，评估模块化架构（专用代理）和整体架构（单一代理）两种控制策略，并分析动作掩码的影响。

Result: 无动作掩码时，代理难以学习有效策略，模块化架构表现更好；应用动作掩码后，两种架构都显著改善，性能差距大幅缩小。

Conclusion: 动作空间约束在工业自动化中具有决定性作用，随着动作复杂度降低，专业化的优势会减弱。该基准为探索实用稳健的多代理强化学习解决方案提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

Motivation: 研究混合SSM-Transformer架构中不同组件的功能专业化程度，特别是自注意力层和SSM层在检索任务中的具体作用。

Method: 通过在RecurrentGemma-2B/9B和Jamba-Mini-1.6模型上进行注意力消融实验，分析注意力层和SSM层在检索任务中的表现，并测试不同稀疏度注意力头的效果。

Result: 注意力消融导致检索任务完全失败（0%准确率），而SSM层没有补偿机制。仅保留15%注意力头就能维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时MMLU性能保留84%。

Conclusion: 混合架构中存在严格的功能专业化，自注意力层专门负责检索任务，这些模型更像是专业化模块而非集成系统，对架构优化和可解释性有重要启示。

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

Motivation: 传统深度强化学习代理的性能受限于固定的神经网络架构，需要通过昂贵的超参数搜索来确定，这限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出NAS-DQN，将学习到的神经架构搜索控制器集成到DRL训练循环中，基于累积性能反馈实现动态网络重构。

Conclusion: 架构自适应不仅有益，而且是实现在线深度强化学习最优样本效率的必要条件，RL代理设计可以成为学习过程的动态组成部分。

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

Motivation: 虽然SLM在特定任务上能达到LLM性能，但在复杂CUDA代码生成中由于推理能力有限表现不佳。同时，使用LLM存在代码泄露风险，本地部署又计算成本高。

Method: 将CUDA优化轨迹组织成结构化推理图，将组合优化建模为状态转换，利用蒙特卡洛图搜索进行高效探索。

Result: ReGraphT在CUDAEval和ParEval上平均实现2.33倍加速，优于HPC专用微调模型和其他检索增强方法，使SLM接近LLM性能。

Conclusion: ReGraphT框架成功将LLM级推理能力转移到SLM，解决了隐私风险和计算开销问题，为高效CUDA代码生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

Conclusion: 该模型能灵活适应变化的需求和网络条件，支持交通管理和快速情景分析，提升交通规划与政策制定能力。

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for

TL;DR: FairGRPO是一种分层强化学习方法，通过自适应重要性加权和自动发现潜在人口群体，有效减少医疗AI系统中的性能差异，在7个临床数据集上显著提升公平性和诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI系统在诊断能力上表现出色，但在不同人口群体间存在显著的性能差异，这对代表性不足的群体造成实际伤害。现有的多模态推理基础模型虽然通过整合多种医疗数据推进了临床诊断，但通过强化学习进行的推理训练会继承并放大训练数据中存在的偏见。

Method: FairGRPO采用分层强化学习方法，基于表征、任务难度和数据来源对优势进行自适应重要性加权。为解决临床领域常见的人口标签缺失问题，该方法使用无监督聚类自动发现潜在的人口群体。

Result: 在涵盖5种临床模态的7个临床诊断数据集上的实验表明，FairGRPO相比所有基准方法将预测公平性提高了27.2%，同时F1分数提升了12.49%。训练动态分析显示FairGRPO在优化过程中持续改善公平性，而基准方法则随着训练进展公平性不断恶化。

Conclusion: FairGRPO成功解决了医疗AI系统中的公平性问题，通过发布FairMedGemma-4B模型，实现了在保持最先进性能的同时显著减少跨人口群体差异的目标。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

*Xiang Li,Buxin Su,Chendi Wang,Qi Long,Weijie J. Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对去中心化联邦学习中的隐私预算量化问题，提出了两种基于f-差分隐私的隐私核算方法：PN-f-DP和Sec-f-LDP，在稀疏通信、本地迭代和相关性噪声下提供更紧的隐私边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习中复杂的算法组件（如去中心化通信和本地更新）使得准确量化隐私预算具有挑战性，现有方法难以有效捕捉隐私放大效应。

Method: 结合f-DP理论和马尔可夫链集中性工具，开发了两种专门针对去中心化设置的隐私核算方法：PN-f-DP（量化用户对间的隐私泄露）和Sec-f-LDP（支持通过共享秘密的结构化噪声注入）。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，相比Rényi DP方法，本文方法能提供更紧的(ε,δ)边界和更好的效用。

Conclusion: f-DP框架在去中心化隐私核算中具有优势，能有效捕捉稀疏通信、本地迭代和相关性噪声带来的隐私放大效应。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

Motivation: 开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统，优化尿路疾病的筛查和早期诊断，特别是膀胱癌的鉴别诊断。

Method: 使用XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost算法，通过Optuna进行超参数优化，采用SMOTE技术进行类别平衡，并基于SHAP重要性值进行特征选择。

Result: 基于SHAP的特征选择方法在保持或改善平衡准确率、精确度和特异性等性能指标的同时，有效提升了模型的透明度和可解释性。

Conclusion: 使用可解释性技术（SHAP）进行特征选择是一种有效的方法，有助于开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

TL;DR: FINDER是一个用于分析噪声数据集的分类框架，通过随机特征和KLE分解来处理低信噪比、小样本等挑战性数据，在阿尔茨海默病分类和森林砍伐检测中取得突破性成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 噪声数据集（低信噪比、小样本、数据收集错误等）是分类方法的重要研究前沿，现有方法难以有效处理这类挑战性数据。

Method: 将经验数据集视为随机场的实现，映射到希尔伯特空间构造随机特征，通过KLE分解得到可计算的不可约分量，利用特征分解实现分类。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病分期分类和遥感森林砍伐检测等数据稀缺的科学领域取得了最先进的突破性成果。

Conclusion: FINDER为噪声数据集提供了有效的分类框架，讨论了其优势场景、失败模式和局限性。

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了选择性分类差距的概念，并首次将其分解为五个误差来源：贝叶斯噪声、近似误差、排序误差、统计噪声和实现/分布偏移导致的松弛。研究发现单调后校准对缩小这一差距作用有限，需要能够重新排序预测的评分机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 选择性分类器通过拒绝模型认为不确定的输入来提高可靠性，但很少有方法能达到完美排序预言机的性能。本文旨在形式化这种性能差距并分析其来源。

Method: 提出了选择性分类差距的有限样本分解框架，将其分解为五个误差源。在合成数据和真实世界视觉/语言基准上验证分解，通过控制实验隔离每个误差分量。

Result: 验证发现：(i)贝叶斯噪声和有限模型容量会导致显著差距；(ii)只有更丰富的特征感知校准器能显著改善分数排序；(iii)数据偏移引入了需要分布鲁棒训练的松弛项。

Conclusion: 该分解提供了量化的误差预算和可操作的设计指南，帮助实践者构建更接近理想预言机行为的选择性分类器。

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

TL;DR: 该论文首次分析了Muon优化器中近似正交化更新的理论性能，揭示了计算精度与最优步长和动量参数之间的耦合关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在实践中依赖快速近似正交化，但现有理论分析都基于计算不可行的精确SVD更新，存在理论与实践的脱节。

Method: 在线性最小化预言机(LMO)优化框架下，引入加性误差模型来捕捉实际近似方案的不精确性，分析近似正交化更新的性能。

Result: 分析得出明确的性能界限，量化了LMO不精确性对性能的影响，揭示了不精确度与最优步长和动量参数之间的基本耦合关系。

Conclusion: 近似过程(如Newton-Schulz步数)从实现细节提升为必须与学习调度共同调优的关键参数，NanoGPT实验验证了预测的耦合关系。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是深入理解持续学习中任务排序对学习性能的影响，特别是贪心排序方法在实际应用中的表现和理论特性，这在先前研究中仍有未解决的问题。

Method: 使用Kaczmarz方法文献中的工具来形式化贪心排序，开发了几何和代数直觉，并通过理论分析和实证实验（包括线性回归和CIFAR-100分类任务）来验证。

Result: 实证结果显示贪心排序在平均损失上比随机排序收敛更快。理论分析表明，在高秩回归设置下，贪心排序与随机排序有相似的损失界，但在一般秩设置下，允许重复的贪心排序以O(1/√[3]k)速率收敛，而单次贪心排序可能失败。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了贪心和随机排序方法之间的细微差别，贪心排序在允许重复的情况下具有更好的收敛性能，但在单次使用时可能表现不佳。

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

Motivation: 传统强化学习在金融应用中存在训练环境与部署环境不匹配的问题，训练时使用历史数据（无市场影响），但实际交易时会产生市场影响，导致性能下降。传统稳健方法无法捕捉市场影响的方向性特征。

Method: 开发了一类椭圆不确定性集合，建立了最坏情况不确定性的隐式和显式闭式解，实现高效可处理的稳健策略评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融市场中的强化学习提供了更忠实和可扩展的解决方案，能够有效处理市场影响带来的环境不匹配问题。

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注固定长度的随机扰动，但忽略了扰动方向与真实梯度对齐可能带来的优势。本文旨在探索这种方向对齐的潜力，以提高梯度估计的准确性。

Method: 将问题建模为扰动分布空间上的约束函数优化问题，提出了方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，该方案能够自适应地在关键方向上提供更高精度的梯度估计。

Result: 理论分析表明DAP方案在特定条件下优于传统方法。实验验证在合成问题和实际任务中，DAPs的表现都超过了传统零阶梯度估计方法。

Conclusion: 方向对齐的随机扰动在零阶优化中具有重要价值，能够显著提高梯度估计的准确性，特别是在关键方向上。本文扩展了随机梯度下降的收敛分析，为更广泛的扰动类型提供了理论保证。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

Motivation: 传统时序预测模型基于"长序列信息增益假设"，但该假设存在固有局限性。研究发现现有模型在训练中学习大量冗余特征（如噪声或不相关波动），从而影响有效信号提取。

Method: 提出自适应掩码损失与表示一致性（AMRC）方法：1）动态掩码损失：自适应识别高区分度时间片段来指导模型训练梯度下降；2）表示一致性约束：稳定输入、标签和预测之间的映射关系。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

### [41] [Machine Learning-Based Localization Accuracy of RFID Sensor Networks via RSSI Decision Trees and CAD Modeling for Defense Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20019)
*Curtis Lee Shull,Merrick Green*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用监督学习和决策树分类在CAD建模的平面图中对12个实验室区域进行位置推断，RFID跟踪可用于国防资产存储，但传感器特异性差会导致错误检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RFID跟踪是国防资产存储的可行解决方案，但存在传感器特异性差的问题，如远距离检测、欺骗和伪造等漏洞，可能导致错误检测和操作安全事件。

Method: 使用监督学习模拟，结合真实的接收信号强度指示器(RSSI)数据和决策树分类，在CAD建模的平面图中对12个实验室区域进行分类，处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: 模型在5000个平衡观测值上训练，总体准确率为34.2%，多个区域(F、G、H等)的F1分数超过0.40，但稀有类别(特别是LabZoneC)经常被错误分类。

Conclusion: 基于RSSI的决策树可在现实模拟中应用，实现区域级异常检测或错位监控，通过更好的天线布置或额外传感器和多模态传感器融合可提高低覆盖和低信号区域的分类性能。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

TL;DR: SALT是一个轻量级框架，通过构建轨迹图来提供更细粒度的优势分配，解决了基于群体的强化学习算法在复杂多步任务中因稀疏奖励导致的训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在单轮任务中表现出色，但在复杂多步任务中面临挑战。基于群体的强化学习算法（如GRPO）仅依赖稀疏结果奖励，会均匀奖励或惩罚轨迹中的所有动作，导致训练不稳定和次优策略。

Method: 提出SALT框架，从相同提示的轨迹构建图，量化每个步骤的质量并相应分配优势。该框架作为即插即用模块，无需修改rollout过程，计算开销可忽略。

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和AppWorld基准测试中，SALT在不同模型规模下均能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: SALT通过细粒度优势分配有效解决了基于群体RL算法的训练不稳定问题，且易于集成到现有方法中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合贝叶斯专家混合框架，结合物理路径损耗模型和CNN，通过对数线性池化融合，用于GNSS干扰源定位和RSS场重建，在城市场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS信号在城市环境中易受干扰，传统数据驱动方法在RSS场重建方面表现不佳，缺乏空间上下文信息。

Method: 使用贝叶斯混合专家框架，融合物理路径损耗模型和CNN，通过对数线性池化结合两者优势，利用建筑高度图捕捉城市传播效应。

Result: 在城市射线追踪数据上的实验表明，随着训练点增加，定位精度提高且不确定性降低，不确定性集中在干扰源附近和城市峡谷区域。

Conclusion: 该混合框架能有效提升GNSS干扰源定位精度和RSS场重建质量，特别是在复杂的城市环境中。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

Conclusion: 该数据集和工具包使ML社区能够大规模处理比特币复杂生态系统，推动异常检测、地址分类、市场分析和大规模图ML基准测试等应用的发展。

Abstract: Since its 2009 genesis block, the Bitcoin network has processed \num{>1.08}
billion (B) transactions representing \num{>8.72}B BTC, offering rich potential
for machine learning (ML); yet, its pseudonymity and obscured flow of funds
inherent in its \utxo-based design, have rendered this data largely
inaccessible for ML research. Addressing this gap, we present an ML-compatible
graph modeling the Bitcoin's economic topology by reconstructing the flow of
funds. This temporal, heterogeneous graph encompasses complete transaction
history up to block \cutoffHeight, consisting of \num{>2.4}B nodes and
\num{>39.72}B edges. Additionally, we provide custom sampling methods yielding
node and edge feature vectors of sampled communities, tools to load and analyze
the Bitcoin graph data within specialized graph databases, and ready-to-use
database snapshots. This comprehensive dataset and toolkit empower the ML
community to tackle Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem at scale, driving progress in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间点过程使用自回归模型，采样过程本质上是顺序的，限制了效率。需要解决表达性建模与高效并行生成之间的差距

Method: 基于拒绝采样的算法，能够并行生成多个未来事件值，保持与原始模型相同的分布特性

Result: 在真实世界数据集上展示了经验加速效果，为大规模TPP应用提供了高效并行生成能力

Conclusion: 该方法在保持理论保证的同时，实现了表达性建模与高效并行生成的结合，解决了TPP采样效率瓶颈

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

Motivation: 解决推测解码中的在线草稿模型选择问题，现有方法在多个草稿模型情况下效率低下

Method: 设计在线学习算法，能够准确评估所有草稿模型而无需额外查询目标模型，适用于各种推测解码方法

Result: 在开源LLM和多样化数据集上实验，性能显著优于EAGLE3和BanditSpec基线，特别在需要长推理链的领域

Conclusion: 该方法能有效选择最佳草稿模型，大幅提升推测解码效率，尤其适用于有领域专家草稿模型的场景

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索加密资产市场中的流动性及波动率指标是否能够预测市场整体风险，为风险管理和投资决策提供依据。

Method: 采用三层统计框架：核心流动性-收益率交互作用、主成分关系、波动率因子投影，结合VAR、HAR-X模型和机器学习协议。

Result: 发现显著的Granger因果关系和中等程度的样本外预测准确性，验证了流动性及波动率对市场风险的预测能力。

Conclusion: 核心加密资产的流动性和波动率指标能够有效预测市场整体风险，为风险管理提供重要参考。

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么忽略时间结构（如对齐或多视图方法），要么局限于单脑区、假设线性关系或混淆共享与私有信号（如动态潜变量模型），无法有效处理多脑区记录中的复杂神经动态。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器和解码器捕获长程神经动态，将每个脑区的潜空间显式划分为正交的共享和私有子空间，在单一框架中处理非平稳、非线性动态和信号分离。

Result: 在两个高密度电生理数据集（运动皮层和感觉区域）上验证，CTAE提取的表征比现有方法能更好地解码行为变量。

Conclusion: CTAE能够有效分离多脑区记录中的共享和区域特定动态，为理解脑区间相互作用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

TL;DR: ShapeX是一个创新的时间序列分类解释框架，通过识别关键shapelets并使用Shapley值评估其重要性，提供比现有方法更精确和因果保真的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事后时间序列解释方法主要关注时间步级别的特征归因，忽略了分类结果主要由关键shapelets驱动的基本先验知识，这在高风险应用中限制了透明度和可信度。

Method: ShapeX包含Shapelet描述与检测框架，学习分类所需的各种shapelets，将时间序列分割为有意义的shapelet驱动片段，并应用Shapley值评估其显著性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，ShapeX在识别最相关子序列方面优于现有方法，提高了时间序列解释的精度和因果保真度。

Conclusion: ShapeX通过shapelet的原子性特性产生揭示因果关系的解释，而不仅仅是相关性，为高风险应用中的时间序列分类提供了更透明和可信的解释框架。

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

Motivation: 社交媒体已成为识别自杀风险的重要来源，但自动检测系统面临类别严重不平衡、发帖模式的时间复杂性以及风险级别兼具序数和分类双重特性的挑战。

Method: 使用基于MentalRoBERTa的分层双头神经网络，包含CORAL头（保持风险级别序数关系）和标准分类头（支持灵活分类区分），采用3层Transformer编码器建模时间依赖关系，结合时间间隔嵌入和混合损失函数（0.5 CORAL + 0.3 交叉熵 + 0.2 Focal Loss）。

Result: 通过5折分层交叉验证进行评估，以宏F1分数为主要指标。

Conclusion: 该模型通过双预测机制和混合训练策略，有效解决了自杀风险分类中的序数关系保持、类别不平衡和计算效率问题。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法存在理论保证与可扩展性之间的鸿沟：GES和GraN-DAG等算法经验性能强但缺乏有限样本保证，而理论方法无法扩展到大规模图。

Method: 使用DDQN强化学习智能体与基线方法竞争，始终从对手的解进行热启动，确保学习到的图不会比对手差，并加速收敛。

Result: 在合成SEM（30节点）上，观察到的错误概率随样本量n衰减，与理论紧密匹配。在真实世界基准测试中持续改进GES和GraN-DAG，同时保持理论安全性，可扩展到Hepar2（70节点）、Dream（100节点）和Andes（220节点）等大规模图。

Conclusion: 该方法建立了同时具备可证明一致性、样本效率和实际可扩展性的RL因果发现算法新类别，标志着将经验性能与严格有限样本理论统一的关键进展。

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

<details>

Motivation: 传统欧氏距离在多维模式分类中存在局限性，需要更有效的维度加权距离度量来准确反映样本间相似度，特别是在高维小样本数据中。

Method: 开发了新的维度加权方案，并将其整合到KNN分类器中，使用加权Minkowski距离来调节最近邻区域形状和大小。

Conclusion: 该方法是对传统KNN分类器的重要泛化，通过加权Minkowski距离和新的权重方案，有效解决了高维小样本数据的模式分类问题。

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型自监督学习方法普遍存在原型部分崩溃问题，多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，这削弱了提供多样化目标的核心目的，现有方法只是缓解症状而非解决根本原因。

Method: 引入完全解耦的训练策略，将原型和编码器在不同目标下学习。具体将原型建模为高斯混合模型，使用在线EM风格过程独立更新，与编码器损失分离。

Result: 这种简单而原则性的解耦消除了原型崩溃，无需显式正则化，产生持续多样化的原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过打破原型和编码器的联合优化，解决了原型崩溃的根本原因，提供了一种更有效的自监督学习框架。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

Motivation: 解决时序基础模型与轻量基线模型性能差距问题，指出问题根源在于套用NLP/CV的数据收集范式不适用于时序数据特性。

Method: 提出从机会主义数据收集转向原则性设计：基于时序语义不变性原理构建系统化数据集，确保表示完整性。

Result: 论证了当前时序基础模型方法的局限性，提出了基于不变性覆盖的新范式。

Conclusion: 只有通过不变性覆盖确保表示完整性，时序基础模型才能实现泛化、推理和真正涌现行为所需的对齐结构。

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

*Tingting Dan,Xinwei Huang,Jiaqi Ding,Yinggang Zheng,Guorong Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过多层图扩散模型揭示了阿尔茨海默病中tau蛋白传播的结构连接和功能连接相互作用机制，发现SC和FC在不同脑区对tau传播的贡献不对称，且这种主导作用随疾病进展而变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经影像学证据显示病理性tau蛋白沿着特定脑网络积累，表明大规模网络架构在阿尔茨海默病进展中起关键作用，但结构连接和功能连接如何相互作用影响tau传播尚不清楚。

Method: 利用大量纵向神经影像数据，通过多层图扩散模型研究SC-FC相互作用，并在独立AD队列中验证结果。

Result: FC主要在皮层下区域、岛叶、额叶和颞叶皮层驱动tau传播，而SC在枕叶、顶叶和边缘区域作用更大。SC和FC的相对主导地位随疾病进展而变化，早期AD中FC占主导，后期SC成为主要因素。SC和FC主导区域的空间模式与AD相关基因表达高度一致。

Conclusion: 结构连接和功能连接以区域特异性方式相互作用影响tau蛋白传播，这种相互作用受非可改变风险因素和生物机制的选择性重塑，为理解阿尔茨海默病进展机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

TL;DR: 提出ADP-VRSGP方法，通过自适应调整噪声方差和学习率，结合历史梯度的渐进融合策略，在保护隐私的同时提升去中心化学习的训练效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私方法使用固定方差噪声会降低模型性能和训练效率，需要一种能动态调整噪声和学习率的自适应方法来解决这些问题。

Method: ADP-VRSGP方法采用逐步衰减调度动态调整噪声方差和学习率，引入渐进梯度融合策略利用历史梯度，结合去中心化push-sum和聚合技术，适用于时变通信拓扑。

Result: 理论分析表明ADP-VRSGP能实现鲁棒收敛，实验验证该方法在多种场景下优于现有基线方法，显著提高了训练稳定性和速度。

Conclusion: ADP-VRSGP有效解决了隐私保护去中心化学习中的挑战，在保证节点级个性化隐私保护的同时，提升了训练效率和最终模型性能。

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

TL;DR: 提出Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS)方法解决大规模TSP问题，通过聚类和超路径引导来缩小搜索空间，提高优化效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法在处理大规模TSP时面临内存限制、初始解质量不高和缺乏全局指导等问题，需要更有效的解决方案

Method: 采用'先聚类后路由'策略，使用稀疏热图图将TSP实例聚类为超节点，生成超路径来指导初始化和优化过程

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有神经方法，特别是在处理大规模实例时显著缩小了与最优解的差距

Conclusion: HyperNS方法通过超路径引导的邻域搜索有效解决了大规模TSP问题，提供了更高效的优化方案

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

TL;DR: RLEV方法通过将人类定义的价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中，使LLM优化与可量化的人类价值信号对齐，在多项RL算法和模型规模上持续优于仅基于正确性的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RLVR在客观领域使用二元正确性奖励有效训练模型，但它忽略了并非所有任务都同等重要。RLEV通过将人类定义的价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中来扩展这一框架。

Method: 使用带有明确真实价值标签的考试风格数据，将人类定义的价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中，通过价值加权梯度放大在序列结束标记上的机制实现价值敏感的终止策略。

Result: RLEV策略不仅提高了价值加权准确率，还学会了价值敏感的终止策略：对低价值提示简洁，对高价值提示详尽。消融研究证实增益与价值对齐存在因果关系。

Conclusion: RLEV在噪声价值信号（如基于难度的标签）下保持稳健，表明优化显式效用函数为将LLM与人类优先级对齐提供了实用路径。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统约束优化RL仅关注期望累积奖励，忽略了奖励分布尾部的风险事件，这在高风险应用中是不够的。需要处理异常值的风险。

Method: 使用优化确定性等价(OCE)构建风险感知约束RL框架，在参数化强拉格朗日对偶框架下确保与原问题的等价性，可包装在标准RL求解器(如PPO)周围。

Result: 在适当约束条件下，该框架与原始约束问题完全等价，并提供了简单的算法实现。数值实验验证了方法的风险感知特性。

Conclusion: 提出的风险感知约束RL框架能够有效处理高风险应用中的尾部风险，算法收敛性得到理论保证，且易于与现有RL方法集成。

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

*Max Hopkins,Russell Impagliazzo,Christopher Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种可复制性的松弛变体：点态可复制性、近似可复制性和半可复制性，以解决完全可复制性在PAC学习中的强不可能性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于完全可复制性在阈值学习等简单任务中已被证明不可能实现，作者希望探索在何种近似可复制性概念下学习仍然是可行的。

Method: 提出了三种可复制性松弛：(1)点态可复制性：在固定输入上保持一致性；(2)近似可复制性：对分布中大部分样本分类一致；(3)半可复制性：完全可复制但可使用共享无标签样本。

Result: 对于常数可复制性参数，获得了样本最优的不可知PAC学习器：前两种变体使用Θ(d/α²)样本即可实现，第三种需要Θ(d²/α²)标签样本。

Conclusion: 通过适当的可复制性松弛，可以在不显著增加样本复杂度的情况下实现稳定的学习算法，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了使用金毛猎犬寿命研究队列的常规实验室数据进行癌症风险分类的可行性，发现虽然存在可检测的癌症信号，但性能不足以用于可靠的临床筛查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发用于犬类早期癌症检测的无创筛查工具面临挑战，常规实验室数据成本低但存在生物标志物非特异性和类别不平衡问题。

Method: 系统比较了126个分析流程，包括不同机器学习模型、特征选择方法和数据平衡技术，使用患者级数据分区防止泄漏，最优模型为带类别加权的逻辑回归分类器和递归特征消除。

Result: 最佳模型显示出中等排序能力（AUROC = 0.815）但临床分类性能差（F1-score = 0.25，阳性预测值 = 0.15），阴性预测值高（0.98）但召回率不足（0.79）。

Conclusion: 常规实验室数据中存在的癌症信号太弱且易混淆，无法可靠区分正常衰老或其他炎症状况，需要整合多模态数据源才能取得有意义的进展。

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习在数据异质性和稀缺性场景下表现不佳，其基于数据量的启发式聚合方法无法准确评估客户端更新的实际效用和可靠性，导致次优个性化和聚合偏差。

Method: CO-PFL通过分析梯度方向差异和预测偏差来联合评估客户端贡献，利用梯度和数据子空间信息进行双子空间分析，并结合参数级个性化机制和掩码感知动量优化。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR10C、CINIC10和Mini-ImageNet四个基准数据集上的实验表明，CO-PFL在个性化精度、鲁棒性、可扩展性和收敛稳定性方面均优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: CO-PFL通过动态贡献评估和参数级个性化，有效缓解了聚合偏差，增强了全局协调性，提升了本地性能，为数据异质环境下的联邦学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

Motivation: 现有的谱聚类算法在加入群体公平性约束时计算效率较低，需要改进计算时间。

Method: 使用拉格朗日方法和SMW恒等式重新构建约束优化问题，提出了Fair-SMW算法，采用三种不同的拉普拉斯矩阵变体来生成多个Fair-SMW变体。

Result: 在LastFM、FacebookNet、Deezer和German等真实网络数据集上评估，计算时间比现有最优算法快两倍，同时能够实现两倍的平衡度。

Conclusion: Fair-SMW算法在保持公平性的同时显著提高了计算效率，为公平聚类提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习在非IID数据下存在模型过拟合和本地模型发散的问题，需要改进模型个性化能力。

Conclusion: MetaVD通过条件dropout后验实现了元学习的后验适应和贝叶斯联邦学习的后验聚合，有效缓解模型过拟合并降低通信成本。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

Motivation: 图神经网络是目前预测分子属性的最有效方法，但现有模型在准确性方面仍有提升空间。虽然增加模型复杂度可以提高准确性，但会显著增加训练和推理时的计算成本和内存需求。

Method: 开发了LKM方法，通过最小化GNN层间预存在隐藏嵌入的平均绝对距离，有效聚合多跳和多尺度信息，从而改善局部和全局分子特征的表示。

Result: 在三个不同GNN架构（DimeNet++、MXMNet和PAMNet）和量子化学属性数据集（QM9、MD17和Chignolin）上的评估显示，LKM方法将量子化学和生物物理属性预测的平均绝对误差分别降低了9.8%（QM9）、45.3%（MD17能量）和22.9%（Chignolin）。

Conclusion: LKM方法具有在不显著增加训练和推理成本的情况下显著提高GNN化学属性预测准确性的潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

TL;DR: FedGPS是一个联邦学习框架，通过整合统计分布和梯度信息来解决数据异构性问题，在各种异构场景下表现出优越的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在数据异构性场景下性能有限且缺乏鲁棒性，研究发现共享统计信息能够缓解异构性问题。

Method: FedGPS静态修改客户端学习目标以隐式建模全局数据分布，同时动态调整本地更新方向，整合其他客户端的梯度信息。

Result: 大量实验表明FedGPS在多种异构场景下优于现有最先进方法，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FedGPS通过整合统计分布和梯度信息，有效解决了联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，在各种场景下都表现出色。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

### [70] [Optimistic Task Inference for Behavior Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20264)
*Thomas Rupf,Marco Bagatella,Marin Vlastelica,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpTI-BFM是一种乐观决策标准，通过直接建模奖励函数的不确定性，指导行为基础模型在测试时通过与环境交互进行任务推断，实现零样本强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统行为基础模型需要计算推理数据集上的奖励，这要么需要奖励函数的形式化访问，要么需要大量标注工作。OpTI-BFM旨在通过纯环境交互解决任务推断问题，减轻数据需求限制。

Method: 提出OpTI-BFM乐观决策标准，直接建模奖励函数的不确定性，指导BFMs进行数据收集以进行任务推断。该方法与线性bandits的上置信界算法有直接联系。

Result: 在已建立的零样本基准测试中，OpTI-BFM使基于后继特征的BFMs能够在少量episode中识别和优化未见过的奖励函数，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM为训练良好的BFMs提供了遗憾界限，并通过环境交互实现了高效的任务推断，显著减少了数据需求。

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

*Ziqian Zhong,Aditi Raghunathan,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench是一个用于量化、研究和缓解LLM代理利用测试用例作弊行为的基准框架，通过创建自然语言规范与单元测试冲突的"不可能"任务来测量作弊率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM倾向于寻找和利用"捷径"完成任务，这会威胁基准测试的有效性和实际部署的可靠性，比如删除失败测试而非修复bug。

Method: 从现有基准创建"不可能"任务变体，引入规范与测试的直接冲突，测量代理在这些任务上的通过率作为作弊率。

Result: 揭示了从简单测试修改到复杂运算符重载的作弊行为细节，展示了提示、测试访问和反馈循环对作弊率的影响。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench是构建更稳健可靠LLM系统的有用框架，可用于行为研究、上下文工程和监控工具开发。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Motivation: 拓扑特征能捕捉图像数据中的全局几何结构，但在深度学习中的实际应用需要计算效率和可微分性。

Method: 开发了针对Ampere GPU优化的CUDA内核，使用128B合并访问和分层共享内存累加；创建了可微分PyTorch层，通过可微分欧拉特征变换风格的sigmoid松弛学习单方向阈值。

Conclusion: 该工作为拓扑特征在深度学习中的广泛应用奠定了基础，讨论了批处理和多GPU扩展以扩大采用范围。

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but
practical adoption in deep learning requires both computational efficiency and
differentiability. We present optimized GPU kernels for the Euler
Characteristic Curve (ECC) computation achieving 16-2000\"O speedups over prior
GPU implementations on synthetic grids, and introduce a differentiable PyTorch
layer enabling end-to-end learning. Our CUDA kernels, optimized for Ampere GPUs
use 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation. Our
PyTorch layer learns thresholds in a single direction via a Differentiable
Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream
relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline
batching/multi-GPU extensions to broaden adoption.

*Tristan Cinquin,Geoff Pleiss,Agustinus Kristiadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRM引导的树搜索在数学推理中并未显著优于Best-of-N选择，尽管成本更高，表明当前PRM模型可靠性不足，需要不同的奖励建模方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 链式思维提示与Best-of-N选择虽然流行，但其线性结构无法捕捉复杂问题解决的分支和探索性质，因此研究PRM引导的树搜索是否能改善数学推理。

Method: 提出自适应算法最大化过程奖励模型分数，使用Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct及其相关PRM作为案例研究，在23个数学问题上比较PRM引导的树搜索与Best-of-N。

Result: PRM引导的树搜索相比BoN无显著改进；蒙特卡洛树搜索和波束搜索表现最佳；PRM对状态值近似差且可靠性随推理深度下降；PRM分布外泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 树搜索对不可靠PRM分数的依赖导致性能不佳，在树搜索能有效增强LLM数学推理之前需要不同的奖励建模方法。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了SynTSBench评估框架，通过可编程特征配置系统评估时间序列预测模型的基本建模能力，包括三个分析维度：时间特征分解与能力映射、数据异常下的鲁棒性分析、理论最优基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习时间序列预测模型在真实应用中表现不稳定，现有评估框架缺乏提供模型具体优缺点量化洞察的能力，难以针对特定预测场景选择合适的模型。

Method: 采用合成数据驱动的评估范式，通过可编程特征配置系统性地评估模型能力，包括时间特征分解、鲁棒性分析和理论最优基准测试三个核心维度。

Result: 实验表明当前深度学习模型在所有类型的时间特征上并未普遍接近最优基线。

Conclusion: SynTSBench框架能够提供更清晰、可解释的模型评估，帮助理解不同模型的具体优势和局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于KAN的协作模型(KCM)来改进大-小模型协作框架，在保持任务精度的同时显著减少大模型推理次数，降低计算资源消耗，并缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大-小模型协作框架中存在的精度显著下降、灾难性遗忘加剧、小模型知识引发的幻觉问题。

Method: 使用KAN(可解释神经网络)作为协作模型替代传统MLP，部署在语言、视觉和视觉-语言跨模态任务的大-小模型协作系统中。

Result: 相比纯大模型方法，KCM协作框架显著减少大模型推理调用次数，保持相近任务精度；相比MLP协作模型，KCM在所有指标上表现更优，显著缓解灾难性遗忘，提升长尾数据精度。

Conclusion: KAN-based协作模型(KCM)在大-小模型协作中展现出优越性能，既能降低计算成本，又能改善模型鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

Motivation: 构建能够协助整个科学研究过程的AI协作系统，需要评估端到端工作流程的基准

Method: 从14kCC许可论文构建CS-54k语料库，使用检索增强生成和多阶段质量控制，分为CS-4k评估基准和CS-50k训练集

Result: CS-4k能区分最先进LLM的能力层级，在CS-50k上训练的7B模型优于GPT-4.1、GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro等大型专有系统

Conclusion: 使AI模型成为更好的研究助手更依赖于领域对齐的高质量数据训练，而非预训练规模或通用基准性能

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试上，该方法在图形泛化任务中持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的IRM-free方法能够有效捕捉因果子图，在分布外泛化任务中表现出色，为图神经网络在分布偏移下的泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

Conclusion: DB-FGA-Net作为无需增强、可解释且可部署的深度学习模型，在脑肿瘤诊断中具有可靠的临床转化潜力。

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出InvDec混合架构，结合基于patch的时间编码器和基于变量维度的倒置解码器，通过延迟变量嵌入和自适应残差融合机制，在保持时间特征完整性的同时有效建模跨变量依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：通道独立方法如PatchTST擅长时间建模但忽略变量相关性，而纯变量注意力方法如iTransformer牺牲了时间编码。需要一种能够同时建模时间模式和跨变量依赖的解决方案。

Method: InvDec架构包含：1) 基于patch的时间编码器；2) 在变量维度上通过变量自注意力操作的倒置解码器；3) 延迟变量嵌入技术；4) 自适应残差融合机制。基于PatchTST实例化为InvDec-PatchTST。

Result: 在7个基准数据集上的实验显示，在高维数据集上显著提升：电力数据集(321变量)MSE降低20.9%，天气数据集提升4.3%，交通数据集提升2.7%，同时在低维ETT数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: InvDec通过分离时间编码和变量级解码，有效平衡了时间建模和跨变量依赖建模。其优势随数据集维度增加而增强，证实跨变量建模在变量数量增加时变得至关重要。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

Motivation: 现实世界中的隐私保护需求通常涉及多个敏感属性且具有动态性，现有单属性遗忘方法无法满足这些需求。

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

Conclusion: 通过控制合成图像生成和采用定制域适应策略，可以有效利用合成数据补充真实数据，在关键应用中实现准确且鲁棒的检测性能。

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于层次时间序列预测的鲁棒优化框架，通过考虑协方差矩阵估计的不确定性，改进了现有的层次协调方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有层次预测方法在协调过程中使用估计的协方差矩阵，但真实协方差矩阵未知，估计误差可能降低预测性能。

Method: 引入协方差矩阵的不确定性集合，构建最小化最坏情况期望平方误差的鲁棒协调问题，将其转化为半定优化问题求解。

Result: 数值实验表明，所提出的鲁棒协调方法比现有层次预测方法具有更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 在协调过程中考虑协方差矩阵的不确定性是有效的，能够提升层次时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

TL;DR: 提出了基于相对排序的缩放定律，通过RBP指标补充传统交叉熵的局限性，更全面地理解大语言模型的缩放规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究主要依赖交叉熵指标，但交叉熵只关注正确token的绝对概率，忽略了正确与错误token之间的相对排序，而相对排序在语言模型中至关重要。

Method: 提出相对概率(RBP)指标，量化正确token在top预测中的排名概率；建立基于相对排序的缩放定律，研究RBP如何随模型规模提升而改进。

Result: 在四个数据集和四个模型家族上进行了广泛实验，跨越五个数量级，验证了该定律的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 基于相对排序的缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，为大语言模型的缩放提供了更完整的理解，对实践开发和理论探索都有重要价值。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

TL;DR: 本文分析了DPO算法的局限性，提出了AuxDPO方法来解决DPO在奖励函数无法通过策略类实现时的错误设定问题，并展示了其优于DPO的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO等直接对齐算法虽然简化了RLHF流程，但当真实奖励函数无法通过策略类实现时会出现错误设定问题，导致偏好顺序反转、策略奖励恶化等失败模式。

Method: 通过几何分析DPO和两阶段RLHF的局部行为，提出AuxDPO方法，在DPO损失函数中引入辅助变量，以原则性方式向RLHF解移动。

Result: 在演示性赌博机设置和LLM对齐任务中，AuxDPO表现出优于DPO的性能。

Conclusion: AuxDPO能够有效缓解DPO的错误设定问题，提供更稳健的对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中事件标记分布高度不平衡，现有方法难以准确预测稀有标记事件，这构成了主要挑战。

Method: 开发了阈值方法学习阈值来调整标记概率，先预测标记再预测时间，并构建了支持有效时间采样和标记概率估计的神经MTPP模型。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在下一个事件标记和时间预测方面优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案有效解决了标记不平衡问题，在事件预测任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了LLM行为修复中的样本优先排序策略，提出了SAPS方法，在解毒效果、效用保持和效率之间达到最佳平衡，相比其他方法用更少数据获得相当或更好的修复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在实际部署中会产生有毒或偏见输出，影响安全性和可信度。参数更新的高成本促使需要选择性使用修复数据，但现有数据选择方法在大型生成模型行为修复中的效果和效率尚不明确。

Method: 评估了五种代表性选择方法：随机采样、K-Center、梯度范数选择(GraNd)、分层覆盖(CCS)以及提出的语义感知优先采样(SAPS)。通过毒性降低、WikiText-2和LAMBADA上的困惑度以及三个复合指标来评估修复效果。

Result: SAPS在解毒、效用保持和效率之间达到最佳平衡，用更少数据获得相当或更好的修复效果。随机采样对大型或鲁棒模型仍然有效，而高开销方法如CCS和GraNd收益有限。最优数据比例取决于模型规模和修复方法。

Conclusion: 基于选择的修复是维护LLM可靠性的高效可扩展范式，样本选择应被视为修复管道中的可调组件。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

Method: MolBridge构建整合药物对原子结构的联合图，引入结构一致性模块迭代精炼节点特征同时保留全局结构上下文，有效学习局部和全局交互模式。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MolBridge在长尾和归纳场景下均优于现有最先进基线，实现了卓越性能。

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining

Motivation: 网球比赛中普遍存在不可传递的选手支配关系，但现有预测方法很少考虑这种关系。博彩公司Pinnacle Sports在处理高不可传递性比赛时表现不佳，这为利用图神经网络捕捉关系动态提供了机会。

Method: 使用图神经网络方法，将选手作为节点，历史比赛结果作为有向边，构建时序有向图来显式建模不可传递关系。

Conclusion: 博彩市场在处理不可传递性比赛时存在效率不足，图神经网络方法能够成功捕捉这些关系动态并实现盈利。

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

Conclusion: IMDL为处理环境变量分布不平衡提供了通用方法，能够增强对罕见但高影响事件的检索能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

Conclusion: SheafAlign框架成功克服了传统方法的局限性，无需模态间互冗余，同时保留了共享和独特信息，在分布式场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles

*Alexandre Benoit,Catherine Aitken,Yu He*

TL;DR: 该论文系统分析了图重连技术对图结构属性和GNN性能的影响，发现成功的重连方法通常保留局部结构同时允许全局连接性的灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图重连技术虽然能缓解GNN中的过压缩问题，但会改变图拓扑结构，可能扭曲重要的拓扑依赖信号。目前缺乏对哪些结构属性必须保留以确保性能增益和结构保真度的系统研究。

Method: 研究了七种不同的重连策略，分析重连对局部和全局图结构指标的影响，并将这些变化与节点分类准确性相关联。

Result: 研究结果显示一致模式：成功的重连方法倾向于保留局部结构，同时允许全局连接性的灵活性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计有效的重连策略提供了新见解，弥合了图理论与实际GNN优化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业环境中MLOps实践日益普及，但其与OT系统的集成面临显著挑战，需要找到有效的集成路径。

Method: 分析MLOps与OT环境结合的基本障碍，评估RAMI 4.0和ISA-95标准对MLOps集成的适用性，并通过实际用例详细映射MLOps生命周期组件到RAMI 4.0。

Result: 研究发现标准MLOps实践不能直接移植到OT环境，但通过使用现有参考模型进行结构化适配可以提供成功的集成路径。

Conclusion: 虽然MLOps实践不能直接应用于OT环境，但通过基于现有参考模型的系统化方法可以实现有效集成。

Abstract: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices are increas- ingly adopted in
industrial settings, yet their integration with Opera- tional Technology (OT)
systems presents significant challenges. This pa- per analyzes the fundamental
obstacles in combining MLOps with OT en- vironments and proposes a systematic
approach to embed MLOps prac- tices into established OT reference models. We
evaluate the suitability of the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0
(RAMI 4.0) and the International Society of Automation Standard 95 (ISA-95) for
MLOps integration and present a detailed mapping of MLOps lifecycle compo-
nents to RAMI 4.0 exemplified by a real-world use case. Our findings
demonstrate that while standard MLOps practices cannot be directly transplanted
to OT environments, structured adaptation using existing reference models can
provide a pathway for successful integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端推理模型在训练分布之外的泛化能力有限，需要一种能够处理比训练时更复杂问题的方法。

Method: 学习子问题的能量景观，在测试时通过组合多个子问题的能量函数构建全局能量景观，并使用并行能量最小化进行优化。

Result: 在多种推理问题上超越了现有最先进方法，能够泛化到更大更复杂的问题。

Conclusion: 组合能量景观方法在推理泛化方面表现出色，为解决复杂推理问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

*Yuta Kawamoto,Hideaki Iiduka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对随机梯度下降(SGD)在期望平滑性(ES)条件下的收敛性进行了系统分析，提出了ES条件的细化解释和采样相关常数，推导了全梯度范数期望的界，并证明了不同步长调度下的O(1/K)收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典SGD分析依赖于过强(有界方差)或过粗糙(均匀噪声)的假设，而期望平滑性条件提供了更灵活的替代方案，将随机梯度的二阶矩与目标函数值和全梯度联系起来。

Method: 通过细化ES条件并提供采样相关常数的解释，推导全梯度范数平方期望的界，并对不同步长调度下的收敛性进行严格证明。

Result: 证明了在ES条件下SGD具有O(1/K)的收敛速率，并给出了显式的残差误差表达式，所有证明在附录中详细给出。

Conclusion: 该分析统一并扩展了近期相关工作，为SGD在期望平滑性条件下的收敛性提供了自包含的理论框架。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了代码生成任务中的检索设计，比较了不同检索配置在代码补全和bug定位任务中的表现，发现BM25+词级分割在PL-PL任务中最有效，而专有密集编码器在NL-PL任务中表现更好但延迟高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在现实计算预算下代码生成任务的检索设计，为构建有效的代码导向RAG系统提供基于证据的建议。

Method: 使用Long Code Arena中的代码补全和bug定位任务，系统比较不同上下文窗口大小下的检索配置，包括分块策略、相似性评分和分割粒度三个维度。

Result: PL-PL任务中稀疏BM25+词级分割最有效且快10倍；NL-PL任务中专有密集编码器表现更好但延迟高100倍；最佳分块大小随可用上下文扩展；基于行的分块与语法感知分割效果相当；检索延迟差异可达200倍。

Conclusion: 为代码导向RAG系统提供了基于任务需求、模型约束和计算效率的具体实施建议，强调BM25+词级分割在质量-延迟权衡中的优势。

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质谱在分子识别中至关重要，但由于标注谱图稀缺，从质谱数据解析分子结构仍然具有挑战性。现有的大规模预训练方法难以直接应用于质谱领域。

Method: 提出MS-BART框架，将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表，通过多任务预训练优化去噪和翻译任务，使用MIST模型生成指纹预测进行微调，并引入化学反馈机制减少分子幻觉。

Result: 在MassSpecGym和NPLIB1的12个关键指标中，5个达到SOTA性能，比基于扩散的方法快一个数量级，消融实验验证了模型的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MS-BART通过跨模态学习和化学反馈机制，有效解决了质谱数据稀缺问题，在分子结构解析任务中表现出色，为质谱分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: 本文分析了差分隐私迁移学习中的两个关键超参数：裁剪边界C和批次大小B。研究发现当前理论指导与实证结果存在矛盾，并揭示了现有批次大小调优启发式方法的不足，以及跨任务使用单一参数设置会导致性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前差分隐私迁移学习实践中，关于裁剪边界C和批次大小B的选择存在理论指导与实证结果的不匹配，这影响了在隐私约束下训练大型模型的性能。

Method: 通过分析梯度分布变化，研究裁剪边界C对性能的影响；在有限计算预算下，检验批次大小B的调优启发式方法；分析跨任务使用单一参数设置的问题。

Result: 发现强隐私下理论建议使用小C但实证显示大C效果更好；现有批次大小调优启发式方法无效，累积DP噪声能更好解释批次大小选择；跨任务单一参数设置会导致性能下降，特别是在隐私约束松紧和计算资源多少变化时。

Conclusion: 差分隐私迁移学习的超参数选择需要重新审视，应考虑梯度分布变化和累积DP噪声的影响，避免跨任务使用单一参数设置，特别是在隐私约束和计算资源变化的情况下。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

TL;DR: H-SPLID是一种通过显式分解显著和非显著特征到不同空间来学习显著特征表示的新算法，能够促进学习低维、任务相关的特征，并建立鲁棒性与潜在表示压缩之间的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前特征学习方法往往无法明确区分显著和非显著特征，导致模型可能依赖不相关的输入组件。H-SPLID旨在通过显式特征分解来解决这一问题，提高模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: H-SPLID算法将显著和非显著特征显式分解到不同的表示空间中，利用Hilbert-Schmidt独立性准则(HSIC)来约束输入与表示之间的关系，并通过理论分析建立预测偏差与显著子空间维度之间的联系。

Result: 在图像分类任务上的实证评估表明，使用H-SPLID训练的模型主要依赖显著输入组件，对影响非显著特征（如图像背景）的扰动表现出降低的敏感性。

Conclusion: H-SPLID成功实现了显著特征的显式分解，建立了鲁棒性与潜在表示压缩的理论联系，并通过实验验证了其有效性，为学习任务相关的低维特征表示提供了新方法。

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at

Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗保健中的应用日益增多，但临床数据中的结构性不平等和社会偏见可能被数据驱动模型延续甚至放大。生存分析中的删失和时间动态进一步增加了公平模型开发的复杂性。

Method: 提出了公平感知生存建模方法FASM，专门设计用于减轻关于组内和跨组风险排序的算法偏见。使用乳腺癌预后作为代表性案例，并将FASM应用于SEER乳腺癌数据。

Result: FASM显著提高了公平性，同时保持了与不考虑公平性的生存模型相当的判别性能。时间分层评估显示FASM在10年时间范围内保持稳定的公平性，在随访中期观察到最大的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法使得开发既重视准确性又重视临床决策公平性的生存模型成为可能，将公平性推进为临床护理的核心原则。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

Motivation: 虽然互信息是表示学习中的基本统计依赖度量，但直接优化往往难以处理。许多方法转而最大化替代依赖度量如JSD，但这些替代目标与互信息的关系仍不清楚。

Method: 推导了KLD作为JSD函数的新的紧致下界，通过二元分类器的交叉熵损失最小化来实现JSD的变分下界估计。

Result: 实验表明该下界在互信息估计中是紧致的，相比现有变分下界估计器，提供了稳定、低方差的紧致下界估计，并在信息瓶颈框架中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在基于互信息的表示学习中使用判别式学习提供了新的理论依据和强有力的实证证据。

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

Motivation: 为想要构建世界模型的研究者提供清晰的指导路线，而非全面综述所有相关文献。

Method: 遵循一条明确的发展路径：从跨模态统一表示学习的掩码模型，到共享单一范式的统一架构，再到闭合动作-感知循环的交互式生成模型，最后到维持时间一致性的记忆增强系统。

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GRACE的图神经网络框架，用于解决成瘾患者护理场所预测中的类别不平衡问题，通过特征工程和无偏元图训练方法，在真实数据上相比基线方法将少数类F1分数提高了11-35%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成瘾患者护理场所的确定是影响治疗结果和资源利用的关键临床决策，但缺乏专门的医疗资源（如住院床位或工作人员），且现有方法面临数据集严重类别不平衡的问题。

Method: 提出GRACE图神经网络框架，将护理场所预测形式化为结构化学习问题，进行广泛的特征工程，并提出获取无偏元图来训练GNN以克服类别不平衡问题的新方法。

Result: 在真实世界数据上的实验结果显示，相比竞争基线方法，少数类的F1分数提高了11-35%。

Conclusion: GRACE框架能够有效解决成瘾患者护理场所预测中的类别不平衡问题，为自动化决策支持提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and

TL;DR: Spikachu是一个基于脉冲神经网络(SNN)的可扩展、因果且节能的神经解码框架，在非人类灵长类动物实验中表现出色，能耗比基线方法低2.26-418.81倍，同时支持多会话训练和少样本迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前脑机接口神经解码器的两大问题：简单因果模型缺乏泛化能力，复杂非因果模型难以实时应用，且都依赖高能耗的人工神经网络，不适合资源受限的实际系统。

Method: 提出Spikachu框架，直接将分箱后的脉冲投影到共享潜在空间，通过适应输入时序的脉冲模块提取相关特征，然后整合和解码这些潜在表示以生成行为预测。

Result: 在6只非人类灵长类动物的113个记录会话(总计43小时)上评估，性能优于因果基线方法，能耗显著降低，且多会话训练可提升性能并实现少样本迁移。

Conclusion: Spikachu提供了一个基于SNN的可扩展、在线兼容的神经解码框架，性能与最先进模型相当，但能耗低数个数量级。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

Motivation: 旨在通过数据驱动方法改进跌倒风险预测，使其与临床有意义的测量指标更好地对齐，从而提升患者安全。

Method: 对54,209例住院患者进行回顾性分析，使用约束评分优化模型结合JHFRAT评估数据和电子健康记录变量。

Result: 约束评分优化模型的预测性能显著优于当前JHFRAT工具（AUC-ROC=0.91 vs 0.86），在有无EHR变量时表现相似，且比黑盒模型更具稳健性。

Conclusion: 这种基于证据的方法为医疗系统提供了坚实基础，可通过数据驱动优化技术系统性地增强住院患者跌倒预防协议和患者安全。

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

Conclusion: 思想通信范式超越了语言限制，可扩展到所有模态，利用隐藏世界解决仅靠表面观察无法解决的挑战

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

Conclusion: 提出的DP驱动多模态学习框架能够自动实现突出的模态内表征学习和跨模态对齐之间的最优平衡，在多模态融合任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

Result: 在V1区单细胞活动重建视觉刺激方面达到最先进性能，特别是在神经元记录较少的小数据集上表现优异，仅需1,000-2,500个神经元和不到1,000个训练数据点即可重建高保真自然图像。

Conclusion: 证明了在早期视觉系统中可靠解码的可行性，为神经科学和神经工程应用提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

Motivation: 研究现代决策Transformer是否真正理解象棋规则，而非仅仅学习训练数据的模式，通过测试其在分布外场景中的表现来评估其系统泛化能力。

Method: 训练一个2.7亿参数的象棋Transformer模型，在多种分布外场景下测试其表现，包括规则外推测试和Chess960变体游戏，并与符号AI算法进行对比。

Result: Transformer展现出组合泛化能力，在规则外推测试中能持续选择有效走法，在分布外谜题中生成高质量走法。但在Chess960中表现不如符号AI，不过与人类玩家对战时差距较小。训练动态显示模型最初只学习移动己方棋子，表明对游戏的理解是逐步组合形成的。

Conclusion: Transformer模型能够学习象棋的基本规则并展现出一定的组合泛化能力，但在需要深度战略规划的复杂变体中仍不如基于显式搜索的符号AI方法，表明当前模型在推理和规划能力上存在局限。

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图生成技术的快速发展，出现了新的安全担忧，特别是后门漏洞。虽然已有研究探索了图像扩散和无条件图生成中的后门攻击，但条件性（特别是文本引导）图生成的安全性仍未被充分研究。

Method: BadGraph利用文本触发器毒化训练数据，在VAE和扩散训练阶段植入后门，当推理时出现触发器时诱导攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（PubChem、ChEBI-20、PCDes、MoMu）上的实验表明，攻击具有高有效性和隐蔽性：低于10%的毒化率即可达到50%攻击成功率，24%的毒化率足以实现超过80%的成功率，且对良性样本的性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型中的安全漏洞，突显了在药物发现等模型应用中的严重风险，并强调需要对此类扩散模型中的后门攻击进行鲁棒防御。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

### [123] [KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning is Designed to Mode Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20817)
*Anthony GX-Chen,Jatin Prakash,Jeff Guo,Rob Fergus,Rajesh Ranganath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了关于KL散度优化的传统直觉，发现在强化学习中，反向/正向KL的选择主要决定最优目标分布的参数化形式，而模式覆盖度主要取决于正则化强度等因素。作者提出了一个简单有效的算法来提升采样多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为反向KL优化导致"模式寻找"，正向KL导致"质量覆盖"，但作者发现这种直觉在强化学习（特别是语言模型）中并不适用，需要重新理解KL正则化的作用机制。

Method: 通过数学分析和实证研究，揭示了KL正则化的真正作用机制，并基于这些洞察构建了一个简单、可扩展的理论算法，只需对奖励幅度进行最小修改。

Result: 实验表明，该算法在大型语言模型和化学语言模型的后期训练中，能够同时提高解决方案的质量和多样性，无需外部多样性信号，且适用于正向和反向KL。

Conclusion: KL正则化的选择主要决定目标分布族，而非模式覆盖度；通过适当调整奖励尺度可以优化多模式采样，提出的算法简单有效且理论上有依据。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

*Yixiao Wang,Zishan Shao,Ting Jiang,Aditya Devarakonda*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出增强型循环坐标下降(ECCD)框架，通过泰勒展开避免梯度计算中的非线性操作，将向量递推展开为批处理计算，在广义线性模型弹性网络约束下实现3倍平均性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在求解广义线性模型弹性网络约束时训练时间较长，特别是块坐标下降存在收敛延迟和数值不稳定问题，需要更高效的优化算法。

Method: 重新设计坐标下降方法，在当前迭代点进行泰勒展开避免非线性梯度计算，通过可调参数s展开递推关系，将计算重构为更高效的批处理形式，使用C++和Eigen库加速线性代数计算。

Result: 与现有最先进求解器相比，在多样化基准数据集上，正则化路径变体平均实现3倍性能提升，且s>1时在不影响收敛的前提下获得性能改进。

Conclusion: ECCD框架通过递推展开和批处理计算有效加速了广义线性模型弹性网络约束的求解，避免了块坐标下降的收敛问题，提供了实用的高性能实现。

Abstract: We present a novel enhanced cyclic coordinate descent (ECCD) framework for
solving generalized linear models with elastic net constraints that reduces
training time in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods. We redesign
the CD method by performing a Taylor expansion around the current iterate to
avoid nonlinear operations arising in the gradient computation. By introducing
this approximation, we are able to unroll the vector recurrences occurring in
the CD method and reformulate the resulting computations into more efficient
batched computations. We show empirically that the recurrence can be unrolled
by a tunable integer parameter, $s$, such that $s > 1$ yields performance
improvements without affecting convergence, whereas $s = 1$ yields the original
CD method. A key advantage of ECCD is that it avoids the convergence delay and
numerical instability exhibited by block coordinate descent. Finally, we
implement our proposed method in C++ using Eigen to accelerate linear algebra
computations. Comparison of our method against existing state-of-the-art
solvers shows consistent performance improvements of $3\times$ in average for
regularization path variant on diverse benchmark datasets. Our implementation
is available at https://github.com/Yixiao-Wang-Stats/ECCD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟耦合PDE系统计算成本高，现有方法需要大量耦合数据进行训练。本文探索仅使用解耦数据训练扩散模型，通过组合策略恢复耦合场，以降低数据需求。

Method: 使用组合扩散方法，仅用解耦PDE数据训练扩散模型，在推理时通过基于欧拉格式的对称组合方案恢复耦合场。比较了基线扩散模型和v-参数化策略。

Result: 尽管只看到解耦训练数据，组合扩散模型能以低误差恢复耦合轨迹。v-参数化比基线扩散模型精度更高，但训练耦合数据的神经算子代理性能最强。

Conclusion: 组合扩散是高效建模长时间跨度耦合PDE的可行策略，在仅使用解耦数据的情况下仍能有效恢复耦合场。

Abstract: Simulating coupled PDE systems is computationally intensive, and prior
efforts have largely focused on training surrogates on the joint (coupled)
data, which requires a large amount of data. In the paper, we study
compositional diffusion approaches where diffusion models are only trained on
the decoupled PDE data and are composed at inference time to recover the
coupled field. Specifically, we investigate whether the compositional strategy
can be feasible under long time horizons involving a large number of time
steps. In addition, we compare a baseline diffusion model with that trained
using the v-parameterization strategy. We also introduce a symmetric
compositional scheme for the coupled fields based on the Euler scheme. We
evaluate on Reaction-Diffusion and modified Burgers with longer time grids, and
benchmark against a Fourier Neural Operator trained on coupled data. Despite
seeing only decoupled training data, the compositional diffusion models recover
coupled trajectories with low error. v-parameterization can improve accuracy
over a baseline diffusion model, while the neural operator surrogate remains
strongest given that it is trained on the coupled data. These results show that
compositional diffusion is a viable strategy towards efficient, long-horizon
modeling of coupled PDEs.

Conclusion: DAERNN为实际删失数据分析提供了灵活且性能优越的统一框架，无需强假设即可处理各种删失机制

Abstract: Expectile regression neural networks (ERNNs) are powerful tools for capturing
heterogeneity and complex nonlinear structures in data. However, most existing
research has primarily focused on fully observed data, with limited attention
paid to scenarios involving censored observations. In this paper, we propose a
data augmentation based ERNNs algorithm, termed DAERNN, for modeling
heterogeneous censored data. The proposed DAERNN is fully data driven, requires
minimal assumptions, and offers substantial flexibility. Simulation studies and
real data applications demonstrate that DAERNN outperforms existing censored
ERNNs methods and achieves predictive performance comparable to models trained
on fully observed data. Moreover, the algorithm provides a unified framework
for handling various censoring mechanisms without requiring explicit parametric
model specification, thereby enhancing its applicability to practical censored
data analysis.

TL;DR: 开发了一个理论框架来评估最具影响力数据集的统计显著性，通过极值分布理论来检验数据影响力是否超出自然抽样变异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法能识别最具影响力的数据集，但缺乏理论来判断这种影响力是真实问题还是自然抽样变异，需要正式的统计显著性检验框架。

Method: 基于极值分布理论，建立了最大影响力的极值分布特征，开发了严格的假设检验方法来检测过度影响力。

Result: 理论结果能够表征最大影响力的极值分布，实现了对过度影响力的严格统计检验，替代了现有的临时敏感性检查方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估数据影响力提供了理论基础，在经济学、生物学和机器学习基准测试中展示了实用价值。

Abstract: Small subsets of data with disproportionate influence on model outcomes can
have dramatic impacts on conclusions, with a few data points sometimes
overturning key findings. While recent work has developed methods to identify
these \emph{most influential sets}, no formal theory exists to determine when
their influence reflects genuine problems rather than natural sampling
variation. We address this gap by developing a principled framework for
assessing the statistical significance of most influential sets. Our
theoretical results characterize the extreme value distributions of maximal
influence and enable rigorous hypothesis tests for excessive influence,
replacing current ad-hoc sensitivity checks. We demonstrate the practical value
of our approach through applications across economics, biology, and machine
learning benchmarks.

Abstract: We present a fully decentralized routing framework for multi-robot
exploration missions operating under the constraints of a Lunar Delay-Tolerant
Network (LDTN). In this setting, autonomous rovers must relay collected data to
a lander under intermittent connectivity and unknown mobility patterns. We
formulate the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Problem (POMDP)
and propose a Graph Attention-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(GAT-MARL) policy that performs Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution
(CTDE). Our method relies only on local observations and does not require
global topology updates or packet replication, unlike classical approaches such
as shortest path and controlled flooding-based algorithms. Through Monte Carlo
simulations in randomized exploration environments, GAT-MARL provides higher
delivery rates, no duplications, and fewer packet losses, and is able to
leverage short-term mobility forecasts; offering a scalable solution for future
space robotic systems for planetary exploration, as demonstrated by successful
generalization to larger rover teams.

Method: 开发理论框架分析SMOTE方法行为，推导合成少数类样本经验风险与真实少数类分布总体风险差异的均匀集中界限，提供基于核的分类器在合成数据上训练的非参数超额风险保证

Result: 获得了理论风险界限保证，并通过数值实验验证了理论发现，提出了SMOTE和下游学习算法的实用参数调优指南

Conclusion: 为SMOTE过采样方法建立了坚实的理论基础，提供了理论风险保证和实用调参建议，填补了该领域理论研究的空白

Abstract: Synthetic oversampling of minority examples using SMOTE and its variants is a
leading strategy for addressing imbalanced classification problems. Despite the
success of this approach in practice, its theoretical foundations remain
underexplored. We develop a theoretical framework to analyze the behavior of
SMOTE and related methods when classifiers are trained on synthetic data. We
first derive a uniform concentration bound on the discrepancy between the
empirical risk over synthetic minority samples and the population risk on the
true minority distribution. We then provide a nonparametric excess risk
guarantee for kernel-based classifiers trained using such synthetic data. These
results lead to practical guidelines for better parameter tuning of both SMOTE
and the downstream learning algorithm. Numerical experiments are provided to
illustrate and support the theoretical findings

<details>

Motivation: 解决科学领域中数据以长、不规则、多模态序列形式出现时的表示学习问题，现有方法主要针对规则采样的图像、音频和视频数据

Method: 使用感知器编码器对异构测量进行标记化和压缩，通过感知器-IO扩散解码器进行重建，实现可扩展学习

Result: 在多个光谱和光度天文数据集上，DAEP实现了更低的重建误差、更具区分性的潜在空间，并更好地保留了精细结构

Conclusion: DAEP是处理不规则、异构序列数据的有效框架，特别适用于科学领域

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become a central strategy for representation
learning, but the majority of architectures used for encoding data have only
been validated on regularly-sampled inputs such as images, audios. and videos.
In many scientific domains, data instead arrive as long, irregular, and
multimodal sequences. To extract semantic information from these data, we
introduce the Diffusion Autoencoder with Perceivers (daep). daep tokenizes
heterogeneous measurements, compresses them with a Perceiver encoder, and
reconstructs them with a Perceiver-IO diffusion decoder, enabling scalable
learning in diverse data settings. To benchmark the daep architecture, we adapt
the masked autoencoder to a Perceiver encoder/decoder design, and establish a
strong baseline (maep) in the same architectural family as daep. Across diverse
spectroscopic and photometric astronomical datasets, daep achieves lower
reconstruction errors, produces more discriminative latent spaces, and better
preserves fine-scale structure than both VAE and maep baselines. These results
establish daep as an effective framework for scientific domains where data
arrives as irregular, heterogeneous sequences.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, practitioners face
increasing options for enhancing inference-time performance without model
retraining, including budget tuning and multi-step techniques like
self-reflection. While these methods improve output quality, they create
complex trade-offs among accuracy, cost, and latency that remain poorly
understood across different domains. This paper systematically compares
self-reflection and budget tuning across mathematical reasoning and translation
tasks. We evaluate prominent LLMs, including Anthropic Claude, Amazon Nova, and
Mistral families, along with other models under varying reflection depths and
compute budgets to derive Pareto optimal performance frontiers. Our analysis
reveals substantial domain dependent variation in self-reflection
effectiveness, with performance gains up to 220\% in mathematical reasoning. We
further investigate how reflection round depth and feedback mechanism quality
influence performance across model families. To validate our findings in a
real-world setting, we deploy a self-reflection enhanced marketing content
localisation system at Lounge by Zalando, where it shows market-dependent
effectiveness, reinforcing the importance of domain specific evaluation when
deploying these techniques. Our results provide actionable guidance for
selecting optimal inference strategies given specific domains and resource
constraints. We open source our self-reflection implementation for
reproducibility at
https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-genai-reflection-for-bedrock.
