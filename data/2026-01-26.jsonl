Spectral methods for directed SBMs often lack stability in asymmetric, low-degree regimes, and existing non-spectral approaches focus primarily on undirected or dense settings.\n  We propose a fully non-spectral, two-stage procedure for community detection in sparse directed SBMs with potentially growing numbers of communities. The method first estimates the directed probability matrix using a neighborhood-smoothing scheme tailored to the asymmetric setting, and then applies $K$-means clustering to the estimated rows, thereby avoiding the limitations of eigen- or singular value decompositions in sparse, asymmetric networks. Our main theoretical contribution is a uniform row-wise concentration bound for the smoothed estimator, obtained through new arguments that control asymmetric neighborhoods and separate in- and out-degree effects. These results imply the exact recovery of all community labels with probability tending to one, under mild sparsity and separation conditions that allow both $γ_n \\to 0$ and $K_n \\to \\infty$.\n  Simulation studies, including highly directed, sparse, and non-symmetric block structures, demonstrate that the proposed procedure performs reliably in regimes where directed spectral and score-based methods deteriorate.

We prove that a vanishing SKDS guarantees alignment of the learned diffusion's stationary distribution with the target. Furthermore, under broad parametrizations, SKDS is convex with an empirical version that is $ε$-quasiconvex with high probability. Empirically, learning with SKDS attains comparable accuracy to KDS while substantially reducing computational cost and yields improvements over the majority of competitive baselines."}

In contrast, for relatively shallow networks, most notably one-hidden-layer $\\texttt{ReLU}$ models, training admits convex reformulations with global guarantees, motivating learning paradigms that improve stability while scaling to depth. MGDL builds upon this insight by training deep networks grade by grade: previously learned grades are frozen, and each new residual block is trained solely to reduce the remaining approximation error, yielding an interpretable and stable hierarchical refinement process. We develop an operator-theoretic foundation for MGDL and prove that, for any continuous target function, there exists a fixed-width multigrade $\\texttt{ReLU}$ scheme whose residuals decrease strictly across grades and converge uniformly to zero.

Considering a large set of gestures, distinct patterns are difficult to be captured by learning algorithms using backscattered received signal strength (RSS) and phase signals. This is because these features often exhibit similarities across signals from different gestures. To address this limitation, we explore the estimation of Angle of Arrival (AoA) as a distinguishing feature, since AoA characteristically varies during body motion. To ensure reliable estimation in our system, which employs Smart Antenna Switching (SAS), we first validate AoA estimation using the Multiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm while the tags are fixed at specific angles. Building on this, we propose an AoA tracking method based on Kalman smoothing. Our analysis demonstrates that, while RSS and phase alone are insufficient for distinguishing certain gesture data, AoA tracking can effectively differentiate them. To evaluate the effectiveness of AoA tracking, we implement gesture recognition system benchmarks and show that incorporating AoA features significantly boosts their performance. Improvements of up to 15% confirm the value of AoA-based enhancement."}

However, this spatial reliance limits applicability to real-world scenarios, such as the \"cocktail party\" situation, where speakers overlap or move dynamically. To address this challenge, we propose an AAD framework for diotic environments where identical speech mixtures are presented to both ears, eliminating spatial cues. Our approach maps EEG and speech signals into a shared latent space using independent encoders. We extract speech features using wav2vec 2.0 and encode them with a 2-layer 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), while employing the BrainNetwork architecture for EEG encoding. The model identifies the attended speech by calculating the cosine similarity between EEG and speech representations.

The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training."}

Submitted to an IEEE journal for possible publication", "summary": "Cell-free networks leverage distributed access points (APs) to achieve macro-diversity, yet their performance is often constrained by large disparities in channel quality arising from user geometry and blockages. To address this, rotatable antennas (RAs) add a lightweight hardware degree of freedom by steering the antenna boresight toward dominant propagation directions to strengthen unfavorable links, thereby enabling the network to better exploit macro-diversity for higher and more uniform performance. This paper investigates an RA-enabled cell-free downlink network and formulates a max-min rate problem that jointly optimizes transmit beamforming and antenna orientations. To tackle this challenging problem, we develop an alternating-optimization-based algorithm that iteratively updates the beamformers via a second-order cone program (SOCP) and optimizes the antenna orientations using successive convex approximation. To reduce complexity, we further propose an efficient two-stage scheme that first designs orientations by maximizing a proportional-fair log-utility using manifold-aware Frank-Wolfe updates, and then computes the beamformers using an SOCP-based design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed orientation-aware designs achieve a substantially higher worst-user rate than conventional beamforming-only benchmarks. Furthermore, larger antenna directivity enhances fairness with proper orientation but can degrade the worst-user performance otherwise."}

Understanding the NN data flow provides a tool for symbolic NN analysis, e.g.,~robustness analysis or model repair. Unlike the standard approach to NN data flow analysis, which is based on information theory, we employ the notion of graph curvature, specifically Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC). The ORC has been successfully used to identify important graph edges in various domains such as road traffic analysis, biological and social networks. In particular, edges with negative ORC are considered bottlenecks and as such are critical to the graph's overall connectivity, whereas positive-ORC edges are not essential. We use this intuition for the case of NNs as well: we 1)~construct a graph induced by the NN structure and introduce the notion of neural curvature (NC) based on the ORC; 2)~calculate curvatures based on activation patterns for a set of input examples; 3)~aim to demonstrate that NC can indeed be used to rank edges according to their importance for the overall NN functionality. We evaluate our method through pruning experiments and show that removing negative-ORC edges quickly degrades the overall NN performance, whereas positive-ORC edges have little impact. The proposed method is evaluated on a variety of models trained on three image datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

By emulating its event-driven and energy-efficient mechanisms, SNNs enable low-power, real-time signal processing. They differ from ANNs in two key ways: they exhibit inherent temporal dynamics and process and transmit information as short binary signals called spikes. Despite their promise, major challenges remain, e.g., identifying optimal learning rules and effective neural encoding. This thesis investigates the design of SNN-based receivers for nonlinear time-invariant frequency-selective channels. Backpropagation through time with surrogate gradients is identified as a promising update rule and the novel quantization encoding (QE) as promising neural encoding.

While Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled, information-based framework that integrates experimental planning with probabilistic inference, the selection of utility functions in BED is a long-standing and active topic, where different criteria emphasize different notions of information. Although Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence has been one of the most common choices, recent studies have proposed Wasserstein distance as an alternative. In this work, we first employ a toy example to illustrate an issue of Wasserstein distance - the value of Wasserstein distance of a fixed-shape posterior depends on the relative position of its main mass within the support and can exhibit false rewards unrelated to information gain, especially with a non-informative prior (e.g., uniform distribution). We then further provide a systematic comparison between these two criteria through a classical source inversion problem in the BED literature, revealing that the KL divergence tends to lead to faster convergence in the absence of model discrepancy, while Wasserstein metrics provide more robust sequential BED results if model discrepancy is non-negligible. These findings clarify the trade-offs between KL divergence and Wasserstein metrics for the utility function and provide guidelines for selecting suitable criteria in practical BED applications."}

The proposed approach enables the determination of optimal parameters for any target distribution matcher rate. Specifically, lower bounds on energy loss, rate loss, and memory requirements are analytically estimated for HiDM architectures approximating the Maxwell Boltzmann (MB) distribution. A semi analytical optimization framework is employed to jointly optimize rate and energy loss, allowing the selection of the number of hierarchical layers, memory size, and block length required to optimize channel capacity. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated through probabilistic amplitude shaping of 16QAM (PAS 16QAM), showing good agreement between analytical predictions and simulated results. The proposed analytical tool facilitates the design of HiDM structures that are compatible with practical hardware and implementation constraints, such as those imposed by state-of-the-art application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Furthermore, the performance of the optimized HiDM structure, incorporating layer selection based on lower-bound energy loss, is evaluated over the AWGN channel in terms of normalized generalized mutual information (NGMI) as a function of the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). At a net data rate of 200 Gbps with 25% forward error correction (FEC) overhead, the proposed scheme achieves a shaping gain improvement of 2.8% compared to previously reported solutions."}

In this work, we investigate the representability of floating-point transformers that use floating-point parameters and floating-point operations. Unlike existing results under exact operations, we first show that floating-point transformers can represent a class of non-permutation-equivariant functions even without positional encoding. Furthermore, we prove that floating-point transformers can represent all permutation-equivariant functions when the sequence length is bounded, but they cannot when the sequence length is large. We also found the minimal equivariance structure in floating-point transformers, and show that all non-trivial additive positional encoding can harm the representability of floating-point transformers."}

Specifically, adversarial training might increase reliance on spurious features, which can harm distribution robustness, especially the performance on some underrepresented subgroups. We present a theoretical analysis of adversarial and distribution robustness that provides a tractable surrogate for per-step adversarial training by studying models trained on perturbed data. In addition to the tradeoff, our work further identified a nuanced phenomenon that $\\ell_\\infty$ perturbations on data with moderate bias can yield an increase in distribution robustness. Moreover, the gain in distribution robustness remains on highly skewed data when simplicity bias induces reliance on the core feature, characterized as greater feature separability. Our theoretical analysis extends the understanding of the tradeoff by highlighting the interplay of the tradeoff and the feature separability.

Since categorical features are usually with a limited number of qualitative possible values, the nested granular cluster effect is prevalent in the implicit discrete distance space of categorical data. That is, data objects frequently overlap in space or subspace to form small compact clusters, and similar small clusters often form larger clusters. However, the distance space cannot be well-defined like the Euclidean distance due to the qualitative categorical data values, which brings great challenges to the cluster analysis of categorical data. In view of this, we design a Multi-Granular Competitive Penalization Learning (MGCPL) algorithm to allow potential clusters to interactively tune themselves and converge in stages with different numbers of naturally compact clusters. To leverage MGCPL, we also propose a Cluster Aggregation strategy based on MGCPL Encoding (CAME) to first encode the data objects according to the learned multi-granular distributions, and then perform final clustering on the embeddings. It turns out that the proposed MGCPL-guided Categorical Data Clustering (MCDC) approach is competent in automatically exploring the nested distribution of multi-granular clusters and highly robust to categorical data sets from various domains. Benefiting from its linear time complexity, MCDC is scalable to large-scale data sets and promising in pre-partitioning data sets or compute nodes for boosting distributed computing.

Here, we present an adaptive graph model that decouples inference latency from computational complexity. By integrating a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, our framework completely transfers the computational burden of neighbor selection and weighting to the training phase. Within this topological structure, higher graph layers enable rapid navigation, while lower layers encode precise, node-specific decision boundaries with adaptive neighbor counts. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art baselines across six diverse datasets, we demonstrate that this architecture significantly accelerates inference speeds, achieving real-time performance, without compromising classification accuracy.

This contrasts sharply with recurrent architectures, where the optimization error can grow exponentially with $T$.

While recent advancements in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to time series modeling (TSM) have shown great promise, their effectiveness on the irregular ICU data, characterized by particularly high rates of missing values, remains largely unexplored. This work investigates two key components underlying the success of LLMs for TSM: the time series encoder and the multimodal alignment strategy. To this end, we establish a systematic testbed to evaluate their impact across various state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on benchmark ICU datasets against strong supervised and self-supervised baselines. Results reveal that the encoder design is more critical than the alignment strategy. Encoders that explicitly model irregularity achieve substantial performance gains, yielding an average AUPRC increase of $12.8\\%$ over the vanilla Transformer. While less impactful, the alignment strategy is also noteworthy, with the best-performing semantically rich, fusion-based strategy achieving a modest $2.9\\%$ improvement over cross-attention. However, LLM-based methods require at least 10$\\times$ longer training than the best-performing irregular supervised models, while delivering only comparable performance.

With the rise of large language models (LLMs), textual attributes in FGL graphs are gaining attention. Text-attributed graph federated learning (TAG-FGL) improves FGL by explicitly leveraging LLMs to process and integrate these textual features. However, current TAG-FGL methods face three main challenges: \\textbf{(1) Overhead.} LLMs for processing long texts incur high token and computation costs. To make TAG-FGL practical, we introduce graph condensation (GC) to reduce computation load, but this choice also brings new issues. \\textbf{(2) Suboptimal.} To reduce LLM overhead, we introduce GC into TAG-FGL by compressing multi-hop texts/neighborhoods into a condensed core with fixed LLM surrogates.

While recent unlearning methods attempt to mitigate this, we identify a critical flaw: structural fragility. We empirically demonstrate that standard erasure achieves only superficial suppression, trapping the model in sharp minima where hallucinations catastrophically resurge after lightweight relearning. To ensure geometric stability, we propose SARE, which casts unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization problem and uses a Targeted-SAM mechanism to explicitly flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts. By suppressing hallucinations under simulated worst-case parameter perturbations, our framework ensures robust removal stable against weight shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SARE significantly outperforms baselines in erasure efficacy while preserving general generation quality. Crucially, it maintains persistent hallucination suppression against relearning and parameter updates, validating the effectiveness of geometric stabilization."}

Under a strictly iso-parameter setup, the collision-free design does not consistently improve validation loss.\n  Through route-stratified evaluation (decomposing per-token loss into hot/cold contributions), we uncover a consistent \"hot-to-cold advantage flip\" during training: hot (high-frequency) positions initially have lower loss, but cold positions eventually surpass them. Crucially, collision-free configurations flip earlier than collision-prone baselines, suggesting that collisions act as implicit regularization. We also identify a gating mismatch: the gate learns to favor hot positions early in training, but this preference persists even after the flip, assigning higher weights to positions with higher loss.\n  Our findings suggest that improving lookup precision alone does not guarantee better training outcomes. The dominant limitation may lie in gating credit assignment rather than index accuracy, and collision-induced noise may provide beneficial regularization that should not be naively eliminated."}

However, predicting early-stage startup success remains challenging due to data scarcity (e.g., many VC firms have information about only a few dozen of early-stage startups and whether they were successful). This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples. Together, we demonstrate that in-context learning can serve as a decision-making tool for VC firms operating in data-scarce environments."}

To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

We show that for a model with width $d$, there is an elementary algorithm to learn the parameters of single-head attention exactly with $O(d^2)$ queries. Further, we show that if there exists an algorithm to learn ReLU feedforward networks (FFNs), then the single-head algorithm can be easily adapted to learn one-layer Transformers with single-head attention.

We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs."}

To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains."}

Prior work addresses this by modifying the embedding space (whitening, contrastive fine tuning), but such transformations alter geometric structure and require recomputing all embeddings.\n  Using isotonic regression trained on human similarity judgments, we construct a monotonic transformation that achieves near-perfect calibration while preserving rank correlation and local stability(98% across seven perturbation types). Our contribution is not to replace cosine similarity, but to restore interpretability of its absolute values through monotone calibration, without altering its ranking properties.\n  We characterize isotonic calibration as an order-preserving reparameterization and prove that all order-based constructions (angular ordering, nearest neighbors, threshold graphs and quantile-based decisions) are invariant under this transformation."}

Deep Ensembles provide robust epistemic uncertainty (EU) but require training multiple full-size models. BatchEnsemble aims to deliver ensemble-like EU at far lower parameter and memory cost by applying learned rank-1 perturbations to a shared base network. We show that BatchEnsemble not only underperforms Deep Ensembles but closely tracks a single model baseline in terms of accuracy, calibration and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on CIFAR10/10C/SVHN. A controlled study on MNIST finds members are near-identical in function and parameter space, indicating limited capacity to realize distinct predictive modes. Thus, BatchEnsemble behaves more like a single model than a true ensemble."}

Utilising this representation, we employ SE(3)-equivariant generative modelling for de novo 3D molecule generation from rigid motifs. In our evaluations, we observe comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art across benchmarks, surpassing it in atom stability on GEOM-Drugs, while yielding a 2x to 10x reduction in generation steps and offering 3.5x compression in molecular representations compared to the standard atom-based methods."}

In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence. Empirical results demonstrate that ARMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard language modeling benchmarks, outperforming established diffusion baselines while requiring significantly fewer training steps. Furthermore, it establishes a new benchmark for parallel text generation, effectively bridging the performance gap between parallel and sequential decoding."}

However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios."}

The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training."}

We establish non-asymptotic error bounds in terms of the Wasserstein-1 distance, without imposing structural assumptions on the computational graph."}

Spectral methods for directed SBMs often lack stability in asymmetric, low-degree regimes, and existing non-spectral approaches focus primarily on undirected or dense settings.\n  We propose a fully non-spectral, two-stage procedure for community detection in sparse directed SBMs with potentially growing numbers of communities. The method first estimates the directed probability matrix using a neighborhood-smoothing scheme tailored to the asymmetric setting, and then applies $K$-means clustering to the estimated rows, thereby avoiding the limitations of eigen- or singular value decompositions in sparse, asymmetric networks. Our main theoretical contribution is a uniform row-wise concentration bound for the smoothed estimator, obtained through new arguments that control asymmetric neighborhoods and separate in- and out-degree effects. These results imply the exact recovery of all community labels with probability tending to one, under mild sparsity and separation conditions that allow both $γ_n \\to 0$ and $K_n \\to \\infty$.\n  Simulation studies, including highly directed, sparse, and non-symmetric block structures, demonstrate that the proposed procedure performs reliably in regimes where directed spectral and score-based methods deteriorate. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first exact recovery guarantee for this class of non-spectral, neighborhood-smoothing methods in the sparse, directed setting."}

In this context, the growing interest in deploying machine learning on edge devices must be balanced against stringent constraints on computational complexity and memory while supporting high-order modulation. Beyond accurate hard detection, reliable soft information is equally critical, as modern receivers rely on soft-input channel decoding, imposing additional requirements on the detector design. In this work, we propose recurSIC, a lightweight learning-based MIMO detection framework that is structurally inspired by successive interference cancellation (SIC) and incorporates learned processing stages. It generates reliable soft information via multi-path hypothesis tracking with a tunable complexity parameter while requiring only a single forward pass and a minimal parameter count. Numerical results in realistic wireless scenarios show that recurSIC achieves strong hard- and soft-detection performance at very low complexity, making it well suited for edge-constrained MIMO receivers."}

Leveraging the connection between KDS and Stein discrepancies, we introduce the Stein-type KDS (SKDS) as an alternative formulation. We prove that a vanishing SKDS guarantees alignment of the learned diffusion's stationary distribution with the target. Furthermore, under broad parametrizations, SKDS is convex with an empirical version that is $ε$-quasiconvex with high probability. Empirically, learning with SKDS attains comparable accuracy to KDS while substantially reducing computational cost and yields improvements over the majority of competitive baselines."}
