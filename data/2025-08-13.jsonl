To enable tractable\ninference, we replace environment-dependent BDD domain grids with uniformly\nsampled ones, and introduce perturbation parameters in each domain to mitigate\ngrid mismatch.

Besides\nit addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for\nexample, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by\njointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown\nprecoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet\nfollowed by RefinementNet.

We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant\nReasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and\nprediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a\npermutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module\nthat incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and\nin-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This\narchitecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and\nsupport examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions\nfor any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference\ntasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results\nacross diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature\nacquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under\ntest-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These\ncapabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware\ninference over structured data."}

Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,\nespecially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and\nhealthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious\nconsequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying\nthe classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing\napproaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be\nequally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel\nmask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to\nenhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a\ntwo-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask\nretention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.\nExtensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration\nperformance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and\neffective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs."}

Multifidelity methods integrate many inexpensive low-fidelity model\nevaluations with limited, costly high-fidelity evaluations. We introduce two\nprojection-based multifidelity linear regression approaches that leverage\nprincipal component basis vectors for dimensionality reduction and combine\nmultifidelity data through: (i) a direct data augmentation using low-fidelity\ndata, and (ii) a data augmentation incorporating explicit linear corrections\nbetween low-fidelity and high-fidelity data. The data augmentation approaches\ncombine high-fidelity and low-fidelity data into a unified training set and\ntrain the linear regression model through weighted least squares with\nfidelity-specific weights. Various weighting schemes and their impact on\nregression accuracy are explored. The proposed multifidelity linear regression\nmethods are demonstrated on approximating the surface pressure field of a\nhypersonic vehicle in flight. In a low-data regime of no more than ten\nhigh-fidelity samples, multifidelity linear regression achieves approximately\n3% - 12% improvement in median accuracy compared to single-fidelity methods\nwith comparable computational cost."}

We model each task as a sequence of labeled\nprompt samples and a query input, where a pre-trained model estimates the\nconditional class probabilities of the query. The expected excess risk is\ndefined as the average truncated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the\npredicted and ground-truth conditional class distributions, averaged over a\nspecified family of tasks. We establish a new oracle inequality for the\nexpected excess risk based on KL divergence in multiclass classification. This\nallows us to derive tight upper and lower bounds for the expected excess risk\nin transformer-based models, demonstrating that the ICL estimator achieves the\nminimax optimal rate - up to a logarithmic factor - for conditional probability\nestimation. From a technical standpoint, our results introduce a novel method\nfor controlling generalization error using the uniform empirical covering\nentropy of the log-likelihood function class. Furthermore, we show that\nmultilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can also perform ICL and achieve this optimal\nrate under specific assumptions, suggesting that transformers may not be the\nexclusive architecture capable of effective ICL."}

However, the interpretability of\ncomplex models remains a challenge, which limits their utility in medical\napplications. Recently, model-agnostic methods have been proposed to measure\nconditional variable importance and accommodate complex non-linear models.\nHowever, they often lack power when dealing with highly correlated data, a\ncommon problem in medical imaging. We introduce Hierarchical-CPI, a\nmodel-agnostic variable importance measure that frames the inference problem as\nthe discovery of groups of variables that are jointly predictive of the\noutcome. By exploring subgroups along a hierarchical tree, it remains\ncomputationally tractable, yet also enjoys explicit family-wise error rate\ncontrol. Moreover, we address the issue of vanishing conditional importance\nunder high correlation with a tree-based importance allocation mechanism. We\nbenchmarked Hierarchical-CPI against state-of-the-art variable importance\nmethods. Its effectiveness is demonstrated in two neuroimaging datasets:\nclassifying dementia diagnoses from MRI data (ADNI dataset) and analyzing the\nBerger effect on EEG data (TDBRAIN dataset), identifying biologically plausible\nvariables."}

It updates network weights through gradient\ndescent to minimize a loss function representing the mismatch between\npredictions and desired outputs. BP uses the chain rule to propagate the loss\ngradient backward through the network hierarchy, allowing efficient weight\nupdates. However, this process requires weight updates at every layer to rely\non a global error signal generated at the network's output.\n  In contrast, the Hebbian model of synaptic plasticity states that weight\nupdates are local, depending only on the activity of pre- and post-synaptic\nneurons. This suggests biological brains likely do not implement BP directly.\nRecently, Predictive Coding (PC) has gained interest as a biologically\nplausible alternative that updates weights using only local information.\nOriginating from 1950s work on signal compression, PC was later proposed as a\nmodel of the visual cortex and formalized under the free energy principle,\nlinking it to Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. PC weight updates rely\nsolely on local information and provide theoretical advantages such as\nautomatic scaling of gradients based on uncertainty.\n  This lecture notes column offers a novel, tutorial-style introduction to PC,\nfocusing on its formulation, derivation, and connections to well-known\noptimization and signal processing algorithms such as BP and the Kalman Filter\n(KF). It aims to support existing literature by guiding readers from the\nmathematical foundations of PC to practical implementation, including Python\nexamples using PyTorch."}
