However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when\nquantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%\nimprovement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to\nstate-of-the-art techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "QuaRC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5c42\u6821\u6b63\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQuaRC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7ea7\u8054\u5c42\u6821\u6b63\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u57281%\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cQuaRC\u5c06ResNet-18\u76842-bit\u91cf\u5316Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53475.72%\u3002", "conclusion": "QuaRC\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This work\nfocuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and\ncarrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for\nlocating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances\nchannel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an\nexisting multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot\n(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix\n(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs\ndifferent Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via\ncorrelation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a\ncorrelation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot\nstructure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is\nproposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the\ndelay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO\nestimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'\nsignals and accurately estimate their TOs.

We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method\nthrough asymptotic theories, numerical experiments and real-world data from a\nridesharing company, showing its superior performance in comparison to existing\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u7684A/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u7a33\u5065\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u6784\u5efa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u548c\u7f6e\u6362\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97p\u503c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "A/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347A/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u6b65\uff1a(1)\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u7a33\u5065\u4f30\u8ba1\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c(2)\u5728\u4e24\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u6784\u5efa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c(3)\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u6362\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97p\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86A/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance\nmitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method\nthat adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each\ninstance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two\ntasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a\ndynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of\n81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based\nadaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of\n87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off\nrelative to our original early-stopping method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u65e9\u505c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b21\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u65e9\u505c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u91cd\u590d\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1181%\u7684LLM\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u51cf\u5c1187%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u635f\u5931\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u65e9\u505c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540cLLMs\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Geometric observations highlight\nthe unique characteristics of DPE errors stemming from multipath and thermal\nnoise as estimation bias and variance respectively. Expanding upon the\ntheoretical framework of DPE noise variance through geometric analysis, this\npaper focuses on a geometric representation of multipath errors by quantifying\nthe deviations in CAF and PVT solutions caused by off-centering bias relative\nto the azimuth and elevation angles. A satellite circular multipath bias (SCMB)\nmodel is introduced, amalgamating CAF and PVT errors from multiple satellite\nchannels. The boundaries for maximum or minimum PVT bias are established\nthrough discussions encompassing various multipath conditions. The correctness\nof the multipath geometrical portrait is confirmed through both Monte Carlo\nsimulations and urban canyon tests. The findings indicate that the maximum PVT\nbias depends on the largest multipath errors observed across various satellite\nchannels. Additionally, the PVT bias increases with satellite elevation angles,\ninfluenced by the CAF multipath bias projection.

At the receiver side, a turbo equalizer with a modified M-BCJR\nalgorithm is proposed to achieve the recovery of ambiguous bits induced by\nDSLM. Experimental verification in a 56GBaud PAM8 system demonstrates that the\nproposed scheme exhibits 1dB receiver sensitivity improvement over 2km\nsingle-mode fiber transmission.

The key innovation lies in a symbiotic\nlearning loop that enables expert specialization: the router selects the most\nsuitable expert for prediction, the relevant experts update incrementally with\nthe true label, and the router refines its parameters using a multi-hot\ncorrectness mask that reinforces every accurate expert. This feedback loop\nprovides the router with a clear training signal while accelerating expert\nspecialization. We evaluate DriftMoE's performance across nine state-of-the-art\ndata stream learning benchmarks spanning abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts\ntesting two distinct configurations: one where experts specialize on data\nregimes (multi-class variant), and another where they focus on single-class\nspecialization (task-based variant). Our results demonstrate that DriftMoE\nachieves competitive results with state-of-the-art stream learning adaptive\nensembles, offering a principled and efficient approach to concept drift\nadaptation.

However, current\nprediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban\nenvironments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in\npersonal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the\ncomplex dependencies among different network services.

Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level\ndatasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,\nshowing outstanding generalization and adaptability.

Unlike conventional methods that\nadapt wireless data to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), ICWLM is\ntrained directly on large-scale, mixed wireless datasets from scratch. It\njointly solves multiple classical physical layer problems, including multi-user\nprecoding (sum-rate maximization and max-min SINR) and channel prediction. A\nkey innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL),\nenabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel\nconditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive\nretraining. Furthermore, we employ the Dynamic Weight Averaging (DWA) algorithm\nto dynamically balance the individual task losses during multi-task training,\nensuring efficient and stable learning across diverse objectives. Extensive\nsimulation results demonstrate that ICWLM achieves competitive performance\ncompared to task-specific methods while exhibiting remarkable generalization\ncapabilities to unseen system configurations.

In such contexts, it\nis often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\\it additional\nsupervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting\nnaturally raises fundamental questions: {\\it What kinds of additional\nsupervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\\it how do they contribute to\nimproved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a\ntheoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision\nas probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine\ncombination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of\nadditional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,\nbut rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled\nclasses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the\nmixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary\nroles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision\ndetermines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing\nthe hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the\nmixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction.

A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which\nis a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not\ntrivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study\nproposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a\ncombination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy\nof the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.\nThe SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the\ninner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear\ncombination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the\nbasis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term\n(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the\noptimization of the parametrized basis functions.

However, these models struggle with the irregularities\ninherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at\nnon-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.\nTo address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences\nrather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and\ncompromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel\narchitecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).\nTIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent\nirregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention\nmechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence\ninformation. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show\nthat TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%\nreduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below\n0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for\nbroader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series\ndata.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTIDSIT\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u7535\u6c60\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u6c60\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6548\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u3002", "method": "TIDSIT\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u53d8\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728NASA\u7535\u6c60\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTIDSIT\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e50%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e0.58%\u3002", "conclusion": "TIDSIT\u5728\u7535\u6c60\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Taken\ntogether, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the\ndoor to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design\nof future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86GPTQ\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0eBabai\u6700\u8fd1\u5e73\u9762\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76GPTQ\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u8bba\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eGPTQ\u4e0eBabai\u6700\u8fd1\u5e73\u9762\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002", "result": "GPTQ\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u5177\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0\u88c1\u526a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7ee7\u627f\u4e86Babai\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aGPTQ\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}
