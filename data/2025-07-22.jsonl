However, HMC techniques\nare computationally demanding for Bayesian neural networks due to the high\ndimensionality of the network's parameter space and the non-convexity of their\nposterior distributions. Therefore, various approximation techniques, such as\nvariational inference (VI) or stochastic gradient MCMC, are often employed to\ninfer the posterior distribution of the network parameters. Such approximations\nintroduce inaccuracies in the inferred distributions, resulting in unreliable\nuncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that combines\ninexpensive VI and accurate HMC methods to efficiently and accurately quantify\nuncertainties in neural networks and neural operators.

However,\ntraditional supervised deep learning methods require a large amount of training\ndata and labels, which are often located in different clients. Additionally,\nthe cost of data labeling is high, making labels difficult to acquire.\nMeanwhile, differences in data distribution among clients may also hinder the\nmodel's performance. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a\nsemi-supervised federated learning framework, SSFL-DCSL, which integrates dual\ncontrastive loss and soft labeling to address data and label scarcity for\ndistributed clients with few labeled samples while safeguarding user privacy.\nIt enables representation learning using unlabeled data on the client side and\nfacilitates joint learning among clients through prototypes, thereby achieving\nmutual knowledge sharing and preventing local model divergence. Specifically,\nfirst, a sample weighting function based on the Laplace distribution is\ndesigned to alleviate bias caused by low confidence in pseudo labels during the\nsemi-supervised training process. Second, a dual contrastive loss is introduced\nto mitigate model divergence caused by different data distributions, comprising\nlocal contrastive loss and global contrastive loss.

In\npractice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of\ncomputing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the\nheterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across\ndevices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework\nfor optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency\nwhile ensuring convergence.

Our approach enforces two fundamental structures: the Riemannian\ngeometry of inertia, by parameterizing inertia matrices in their natural\nmathematical space of symmetric positive-definite matrices, and the symplectic\ngeometry of phase space, using a constrained autoencoder to ensure the\npreservation of phase space volume in a reduced latent space. We demonstrate\nthrough experiments on systems ranging from coupled oscillators to\nhigh-dimensional deformable objects that GeoHNN significantly outperforms\nexisting models. It achieves superior long-term stability, accuracy, and energy\nconservation, confirming that embedding the geometry of physics is not just a\ntheoretical appeal but a practical necessity for creating robust and\ngeneralizable models of the physical world."}

With a given number of PAs, two deployment strategies\nare considered, namely the centralized PA deployment, where all PAs are\nswitched between waveguides to serve users in a time-division manner to avail\nof beamforming gain, and the distributed PA deployment, where a single PA is\ndeployed on each waveguide to simultaneously serve multiple users by leveraging\nthe multiplexing gain. The spectral efficiency (SE) achieved by each deployment\nstrategy is analyzed: i) For the centralized deployment, the positioning\nstrategy of PAs on each waveguide is determined first with the aim of\nmaximizing the channel gain of the corresponding nearest served user. Based on\nthis, the corresponding system SE is derived. ii) For the distributed\ndeployment, the system SE under the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is first\nobtained. To obtain an analytically tractable form, the stationary phase method\nis utilized to approximate the system SE. The approximation result reveals that\nthe average inter-user interference can be negligible with a large waveguide\nspacing and thus the simple MRT is appealing for PA-based multi-user\ncommunications. Furthermore, the system SEs achieved by the two strategies are\ncompared in both the high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.

This paper establishes bounds\non the minimum number of downlink beamformers, in which sensing performance is\nmeasured in terms of the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound for parameter estimation and\ncommunications performance is measured in terms of the\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise ratios.

FL allows wireless devices (WDs) to\ncooperatively learn by sharing only local model parameters, without needing to\nshare the entire dataset. However, the emergence of large AI models has made\nexisting FL approaches inefficient, due to the significant communication\noverhead required. In this paper, we propose a novel over-the-air federated\ndistillation (FD) framework by synergizing the strength of FL and knowledge\ndistillation to avoid the heavy local model transmission. Instead of sharing\nthe model parameters, only the WDs' model outputs, referred to as knowledge,\nare shared and aggregated over-the-air by exploiting the superposition property\nof the multiple-access channel. We shall study the transceiver design in\nover-the-air FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting\nthe power constraints of the transceivers. The main challenge lies in the\nintractability of the learning performance analysis, as well as the non-convex\nnature and the optimization spanning the whole FD training period. To tackle\nthis problem, we first derive an analytical expression of the convergence rate\nin over-the-air FD. Then, the closed-form optimal solutions of the WDs'\ntransmit power and the estimator for over-the-air aggregation are obtained\ngiven the receiver combining strategy. Accordingly, we put forth an efficient\napproach to find the optimal receiver beamforming vector via semidefinite\nrelaxation. We further prove that there is no optimality gap between the\noriginal and relaxed problem for the receiver beamforming design. Numerical\nresults will show that the proposed over-the-air FD approach achieves a\nsignificant reduction in communication overhead, with only a minor compromise\nin testing accuracy compared to conventional FL benchmarks."}

We then show how flow equivariance can be introduced, and\ndemonstrate that these models significantly outperform their non-equivariant\ncounterparts in terms of training speed, length generalization, and velocity\ngeneralization, on both next step prediction and sequence classification. We\npresent this work as a first step towards building sequence models that respect\nthe time-parameterized symmetries which govern the world around us."}

We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel.

We propose a framework that can\neffectively utilize expert demonstrations, even when they are incomplete and\nimperfect. By applying a mapping function to transform the similarity between\nan agent's state and expert data into a shaped intrinsic reward, our method\nallows for flexible and targeted exploration of expert-like behaviors. We\nemploy a Mixture of Autoencoder Experts to capture a diverse range of behaviors\nand accommodate missing information in demonstrations. Experiments show our\napproach enables robust exploration and strong performance in both sparse and\ndense reward environments, even when demonstrations are sparse or incomplete.\nThis provides a practical framework for RL in realistic settings where optimal\ndata is unavailable and precise reward control is needed."}

For example, Preferential Subspace Identification (PSID) builds\na state-space model of a primary time-series (e.g., neural activity) to\noptimally predict a secondary time-series (e.g., behavior). However, PSID\nfocuses on optimal prediction using past primary data, even though in offline\napplications, better estimation can be achieved by incorporating concurrent\ndata (filtering) or all available data (smoothing). Here, we extend PSID to\nenable optimal filtering and smoothing. First, we show that the presence of a\nsecondary signal makes it possible to uniquely identify a model with an optimal\nKalman update step (to enable filtering) from a family of otherwise equivalent\nstate-space models. Our filtering solution augments PSID with a reduced-rank\nregression step that directly learns the optimal gain required for the update\nstep from data. We refer to this extension of PSID as PSID with filtering.\nSecond, inspired by two-filter Kalman smoother formulations, we develop a novel\nforward-backward PSID smoothing algorithm where we first apply PSID with\nfiltering and then apply it again in the reverse time direction on the\nresiduals of the filtered secondary signal. We validate our methods on\nsimulated data, showing that our approach recovers the ground-truth model\nparameters for filtering, and achieves optimal filtering and smoothing decoding\nperformance of the secondary signal that matches the ideal performance of the\ntrue underlying model.

A consortium comprising GMV GmbH, Saarland\nUniversity, and Thales Alenia Space collaborates to develop AI-driven\nalgorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness over traditional methods for\ntwo crucial operational challenges: data routing and resource allocation. In\nthe routing use case, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to improve the\nend-to-end latency by learning from historical queuing latency, outperforming\nclassical shortest path algorithms. For resource allocation, RL optimizes the\nscheduling of tasks across constellations, focussing on efficiently using\nlimited resources such as battery and memory. Both use cases were tested for\nmultiple satellite constellation configurations and operational scenarios,\nresembling the real-life spacecraft operations of communications and Earth\nobservation satellites.

We plan to apply this\nmethodology to accelerate testing in production pipelines, thereby shortening\ndevelopment cycles and improving overall system efficiency. We believe our\ninsights and lessons learned will aid researchers and practitioners seeking\nscalable, cost-effective solutions for synthetic data generation."}

GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point\nrewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions\ncentered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment\nby measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target\nregions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance\nmechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions.\nThis framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to\ndense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich\ngradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions.\nExtensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro\nbenchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms\nstate-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of\n24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro.

Furthermore, experimental results on the\nseizure-independent division supported our assertion that a more rigorous\nseizure-independent division should be used for patients with abundant EEG\nrecordings."}

We propose a novel, fast, and\neasy-to-use imputation method called missing value imputation with adversarial\nrandom forests (MissARF), based on generative machine learning, that provides\nboth single and multiple imputation. MissARF employs adversarial random forest\n(ARF) for density estimation and data synthesis. To impute a missing value of\nan observation, we condition on the non-missing values and sample from the\nestimated conditional distribution generated by ARF. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that MissARF performs comparably to state-of-the-art single and\nmultiple imputation methods in terms of imputation quality and fast runtime\nwith no additional costs for multiple imputation."}

Leveraging a newly defined notion\nof homoscedasticity, we develop a conformal prediction algorithm that offers\nfinite-sample coverage guarantees and fast convergence rates of the oracle\nestimator. In heteroscedastic settings, we forgo these non-asymptotic\nguarantees to gain statistical efficiency, proposing a local\n$k$--nearest--neighbor method without conformal calibration that is adaptive to\nthe geometry of each particular nonlinear space. Both procedures work with any\nregression algorithm and are scalable to large data sets, allowing\npractitioners to plug in their preferred models and incorporate domain\nexpertise. We prove consistency for the proposed estimators under minimal\nconditions. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach in\npersonalized--medicine applications involving random response objects such as\nprobability distributions and graph Laplacians."}

Pending publication in Springer\n  proceedings", "summary": "In recent decades, hypergraphs and their analysis through Topological Data\nAnalysis (TDA) have emerged as powerful tools for understanding complex data\nstructures. Various methods have been developed to construct hypergraphs --\nreferred to as simplicial complexes in the TDA framework -- over datasets,\nenabling the formation of edges between more than two vertices. This paper\naddresses the challenge of constructing hypergraphs from collections of\nmultivariate time series. While prior work has focused on the case of a single\nmultivariate time series, we extend this framework to handle collections of\nsuch time series. Our approach generalizes the method proposed in Chretien and\nal. by leveraging the properties of signature transforms to introduce\ncontrolled randomness, thereby enhancing the robustness of the construction\nprocess. We validate our method on synthetic datasets and present promising\nresults."}
