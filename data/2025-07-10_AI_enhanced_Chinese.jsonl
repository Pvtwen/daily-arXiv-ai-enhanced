We model the uncertainty that the learner faces by a\ndistribution $\\pi$ in the ground-truth triples $(p, q, f)$ -- which we call a\nUDA class -- where $(p, q)$ is the source -- target distribution pair and $f$\nis the classifier. We define the performance of a learner as the overall target\ndomain risk, averaged over the randomness of the ground-truth triple. This\nformulation couples the source distribution, the target distribution and the\nclassifier in the ground truth, and deviates from the classical worst-case\nanalyses, which pessimistically emphasize the impact of hard but rare UDA\ninstances. In this formulation, we precisely characterize the optimal learner.\nThe performance of the optimal learner then allows us to define the learning\ndifficulty for the UDA class and for the observed sample. To quantify this\ndifficulty, we introduce an information-theoretic quantity -- Posterior Target\nLabel Uncertainty (PTLU) -- along with its empirical estimate (EPTLU) from the\nsample , which capture the uncertainty in the prediction for the target domain.\nBriefly, PTLU is the entropy of the predicted label in the target domain under\nthe posterior distribution of ground-truth classifier given the observed source\nand target samples. By proving that such a quantity serves to lower-bound the\nrisk of any learner, we suggest that these quantities can be used as proxies\nfor evaluating the hardness of UDA learning. We provide several examples to\ndemonstrate the advantage of PTLU, relative to the existing measures, in\nevaluating the difficulty of UDA learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff08UDA\uff09\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u540e\u9a8c\u76ee\u6807\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08PTLU\uff09\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316UDA\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u4e8e\u60b2\u89c2\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u771f\u5b9eUDA\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff08\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff09\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86UDA\u7c7b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e3a\u5e73\u5747\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86PTLU\u53ca\u5176\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4f30\u8ba1EPTLU\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86PTLU\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3aUDA\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "PTLU\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30UDA\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Since human gesture motion\ninduces subtle and random variations in wireless multipath propagation, how to\naccurately model human gesture channels has become a crucial issue for the\ndesign and validation of ISAC systems. To this end, this paper proposes a deep\nlearning-based human gesture channel modeling framework for ISAC scenarios, in\nwhich the human body is decomposed into multiple body parts, and the mapping\nbetween human gestures and their corresponding multipath characteristics is\nlearned from real-world measurements. Specifically, a Poisson neural network is\nemployed to predict the number of Multi-Path Components (MPCs) for each human\nbody part, while Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (C-VAEs) are reused to\ngenerate the scattering points, which are further used to reconstruct\ncontinuous channel impulse responses and micro-Doppler signatures.

Fully exploiting these\ncapabilities requires a unified design that bridges system-level optimization\nwith multi-target parameter estimation. This paper proposes an end-to-end graph\nlearning approach to close this gap, modeling the entire cell-free ISAC network\nas a heterogeneous graph to jointly design the AP mode selection, user\nassociation, precoding, and echo signal processing for multi-target position\nand velocity estimation. In particular, we propose two novel heterogeneous\ngraph learning frameworks: a dynamic graph learning framework and a lightweight\nmirror-based graph attention network (mirror-GAT) framework.

A key desirable property of the calibration map is\ninstance-wise monotonicity (i.e., preserving the ranking of probability\noutputs). However, most existing post-hoc calibration methods do not guarantee\nmonotonicity. Previous monotonic approaches either use an under-parameterized\ncalibration map with limited expressive ability or rely on black-box neural\nnetworks, which lack interpretability and robustness. In this paper, we propose\na family of novel monotonic post-hoc calibration methods, which employs a\nconstrained calibration map parameterized linearly with respect to the number\nof classes. Our proposed approach ensures expressiveness, robustness, and\ninterpretability while preserving the relative ordering of the probability\noutput by formulating the proposed calibration map as a constrained\noptimization problem. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance\nacross datasets with different deep neural network models, outperforming\nexisting calibration methods while being data and computation-efficient.

As these\nsystems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict\ntheir states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control\ndecisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior.\nModern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including\nelectrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges\nfor modeling and prediction.

Previous methods, such as adding noise to gradients for\ndifferential privacy, work well on large datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-100, but\nfail on small, imbalanced medical datasets like HAM10000. This is because the\nimbalanced distribution causes gradients from minority classes to be clipped\nand lose crucial information, while majority classes dominate.

Yet, rare conditions in the intensive care unit (ICU), including\nrecognised rare diseases and low-prevalence conditions in the ICU, remain\nunderserved due to data scarcity and intra-condition heterogeneity. To bridge\nsuch gaps, we developed KnowRare, a domain adaptation-based deep learning\nframework for predicting clinical outcomes for rare conditions in the ICU.\nKnowRare mitigates data scarcity by initially learning condition-agnostic\nrepresentations from diverse electronic health records through self-supervised\npre-training. It addresses intra-condition heterogeneity by selectively\nadapting knowledge from clinically similar conditions with a developed\ncondition knowledge graph. Evaluated on two ICU datasets across five clinical\nprediction tasks (90-day mortality, 30-day readmission, ICU mortality,\nremaining length of stay, and phenotyping), KnowRare consistently outperformed\nexisting state-of-the-art models.

Recently, several studies\nhighlighted the impact of the geometry of training trajectories on the\ngeneralization error, both theoretically and empirically. Among these works, a\nseries of topological generalization bounds have been proposed, relating the\ngeneralization error to notions of topological complexity that stem from\ntopological data analysis (TDA). Despite their empirical success, these bounds\nrely on intricate information-theoretic (IT) terms that can be bounded in\nspecific cases but remain intractable for practical algorithms (such as ADAM),\npotentially reducing the relevance of the derived bounds. In this paper, we\nseek to formulate comprehensive and interpretable topological generalization\nbounds free of intractable mutual information terms. To this end, we introduce\na novel learning theoretic framework that departs from the existing strategies\nvia proof techniques rooted in algorithmic stability. By extending an existing\nnotion of \\textit{hypothesis set stability}, to \\textit{trajectory stability},\nwe prove that the generalization error of trajectory-stable algorithms can be\nupper bounded in terms of (i) TDA quantities describing the complexity of the\ntrajectory of the optimizer in the parameter space, and (ii) the trajectory\nstability parameter of the algorithm.

By combining these two techniques\nsynergistically, expensive computations are expressed as solutions to systems\nof linear equations and obtained by leveraging iterative linear system solvers.\nThis drastically reduces memory requirements, facilitating application to\nsignificantly larger amounts of data, and introduces matrix multiplication as\nthe main computational operation, which is ideal for modern hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this\nstudy, we derive forward-forward algorithms for binary, stochastic units.\nBinarization of the activations transforms matrix multiplications into indexing\noperations, which can be executed efficiently in hardware. Stochasticity,\ncombined with tied weights across units with different biases, bypasses the\ninformation bottleneck imposed by binary units. Furthermore, although slow and\nexpensive in traditional hardware, binary sampling that is very fast can be\nimplemented cheaply with p-bits (probabilistic bits), novel devices made up of\nunstable magnets.

In this study, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of Adam\nstems largely from its similarity to SignSGD in robustly handling large\ngradient fluctuations, yet it is also vulnerable to destabilizing loss spikes\ndue to its uncontrolled update scaling. To enhance the advantage of Adam and\nmitigate its limitation, we propose SignSoftSGD (S3), a novel optimizer with\nthree key innovations. \\emph{First}, S3 generalizes the sign-like update by\nemploying a flexible $p$-th order momentum ($p \\geq 1$) in the denominator,\ndeparting from the conventional second-order momentum (variance)\npreconditioning. This design enables enhanced performance while achieving\nstable training even with aggressive learning rates. \\emph{Second}, S3\nminimizes the occurrences of loss spikes through unified exponential moving\naverage coefficients for numerator and denominator momenta, which inherently\nbound updates to $[-1, 1]$ and simplify hyperparameter tuning. \\emph{Third}, S3\nincorporates an equivalent Nesterov's accelerated gradient(NAG) module,\naccelerating convergence without memory overhead.

In our experimentation, we apply the set of prototype models\non a diverse set of datasets including fine-grained classification, Non-IID\nsettings and multi-label classification to further contrast the performance.\nFurthermore, we also provide our code as an open-source library, which\nfacilitates simple application of the metrics itself, as well as extensibility\n- providing the option for easily adding new metrics and models.\nhttps://github.com/uos-sis/quanproto", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u539f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982ProtoPNet\u3001ProtoPool\u548cPIPNet\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u3002", "motivation": "\u539f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08XAI\uff09\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u539f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff08ProtoPNet\u3001ProtoPool\u3001PIPNet\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u539f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u539f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fbf\u5229\u3002"}}

Since\ndifferent discrete emotions may exist at the same time, compared with\nsingle-class emotion recognition, emotion distribution learning (EDL) that\nidentifies a mixture of basic emotions has gradually emerged as a trend.\nHowever, existing EDL methods face challenges in mining the heterogeneity among\nmultiple modalities. Besides, rich semantic correlations across arbitrary basic\nemotions are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal\nemotion distribution learning framework, named HeLo, aimed at fully exploring\nthe heterogeneity and complementary information in multi-modal emotional data\nand label correlation within mixed basic emotions. Specifically, we first adopt\ncross-attention to effectively fuse the physiological data. Then, an optimal\ntransport (OT)-based heterogeneity mining module is devised to mine the\ninteraction and heterogeneity between the physiological and behavioral\nrepresentations. To facilitate label correlation learning, we introduce a\nlearnable label embedding optimized by correlation matrix alignment. Finally,\nthe learnable label embeddings and label correlation matrices are integrated\nwith the multi-modal representations through a novel label correlation-driven\ncross-attention mechanism for accurate emotion distribution learning.\nExperimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposed method in emotion distribution learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHeLo\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6316\u6398\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u57fa\u672c\u60c5\u611f\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6316\u6398\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u672c\u60c5\u611f\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6316\u6398\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "HeLo\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6316\u6398\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional methods rely heavily on expert interpretation\nand lack scalability. Pioneering machine learning methods have introduced\nretrieval-based strategies, but their reliance on finite libraries limits\ngeneralization to novel molecules. Generative models offer a promising\nalternative, yet most adopt autoregressive SMILES-based architectures that\noverlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In\nthis work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that directly infers\nboth 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data using\ndiffusion models. DiffSpectra formulates structure elucidation as a conditional\ngeneration process. Its denoising network is parameterized by Diffusion\nMolecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture that integrates\ntopological and geometric information. Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer,\na transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral\ndependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nDiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact\nstructures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through\nsampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling,\nSpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. These results highlight\nthe effectiveness of spectrum-conditioned diffusion modeling in addressing the\nchallenge of molecular structure elucidation.

One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level\nperformance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of\nrollout data volume.

Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our NVML approach significantly enhances the\nrobustness and safety of traffic sign recognition systems under adversarial\nconditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdN\u7248\u672c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08NVML\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u52a0\u6743\u8f6f\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u8bc6\u522b\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528NVML\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408FMEA\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e09\u7248\u672cNVML\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6297FGSM\u548cPGD\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNVML\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NVML\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

A similar constraint applies\nto the fully unsupervised PINN setting when boundary labels are sampled\nnoisily. Consequently, increasing the number of noisy supervision labels alone\ndoes not provide a ``free lunch'' in reducing empirical risk.

In this work, we revisit small\nbatch sizes all the way down to batch size one, and we propose a rule for\nscaling Adam hyperparameters to small batch sizes. We find that small batch\nsizes (1) train stably, (2) are consistently more robust to hyperparameter\nchoices, (3) achieve equal or better per-FLOP performance than larger batch\nsizes, and (4) notably enable stable language model training with vanilla SGD,\neven without momentum, despite storing no optimizer state.

The dominant machine\nlearning paradigm is built on the premise that scaling data and model sizes\nwill improve out-of-distribution performance, including compositional\ngeneralization. We test this premise through controlled experiments that\nsystematically vary data scale, concept diversity, and combination coverage. We\nfind that compositional generalization is driven by data diversity, not mere\ndata scale. Increased combinatorial coverage forces models to discover a\nlinearly factored representational structure, where concepts decompose into\nadditive components. We prove this structure is key to efficiency, enabling\nperfect generalization from few observed combinations. Evaluating pretrained\nmodels (DINO, CLIP), we find above-random yet imperfect performance, suggesting\npartial presence of this structure. Our work motivates stronger emphasis on\nconstructing diverse datasets for compositional generalization, and considering\nthe importance of representational structure that enables efficient\ncompositional learning.
