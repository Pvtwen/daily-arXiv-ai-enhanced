<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耳鸣影响10-15%人口但缺乏客观诊断生物标志物，需要开发基于神经影像的客观诊断工具。

Method: 分析64通道EEG数据(80人)和静息态fMRI数据(38人)。EEG提取微状态特征(440特征/人)，fMRI使用切片CNN和混合模型(VGG16、ResNet50结合决策树、随机森林、SVM)。采用5折交叉验证评估性能。

Result: EEG显示耳鸣患者gamma波段微状态B出现显著减少(健康:56.56 vs 耳鸣:43.81, p<0.001)，alpha覆盖度降低。树基分类器准确率98.8%，VGG16小波变换EEG准确率95.4%(delta)和94.1%(alpha)。fMRI切片17准确率达99.0%，VGG16-决策树混合模型准确率98.95%。

Conclusion: EEG和fMRI提供了有效的耳鸣神经生物标志物。树基和混合模型表现优异，表明耳鸣是多网络障碍，需要多模态分析。

Abstract: Objective: Tinnitus affects 10-15% of the population yet lacks objective
diagnostic biomarkers. This study applied machine learning to EEG and fMRI data
to identify neural signatures distinguishing tinnitus patients from healthy
controls. Methods: Two datasets were analyzed: 64-channel EEG recordings from
80 participants (40 tinnitus, 40 controls) and resting-state fMRI data from 38
participants (19 tinnitus, 19 controls). EEG analysis extracted microstate
features across four to seven clustering states and five frequency bands,
producing 440 features per subject. Global Field Power signals were also
transformed into wavelet images for deep learning. fMRI data were analyzed
using slice-wise convolutional neural networks and hybrid models combining
pre-trained architectures (VGG16, ResNet50) with Decision Tree, Random Forest,
and SVM classifiers. Model performance was evaluated using 5-fold
cross-validation based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Results: EEG microstate analysis revealed altered network dynamics in tinnitus,
particularly reduced gamma-band microstate B occurrence (healthy: 56.56 vs
tinnitus: 43.81, p < 0.001) and diminished alpha coverage. Tree-based
classifiers achieved up to 98.8% accuracy, while VGG16 on wavelet-transformed
EEG yielded 95.4% and 94.1% accuracy for delta and alpha bands, respectively.
fMRI analysis identified 12 high-performing axial slices (>=90% accuracy), with
slice 17 reaching 99.0%. The hybrid VGG16-Decision Tree model achieved 98.95%
+/- 2.94% accuracy. Conclusion: EEG and fMRI provided effective neural
biomarkers for tinnitus classification. Tree-based and hybrid models
demonstrated superior performance, highlighting tinnitus as a multi-network
disorder requiring multimodal analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现便携式实时心电图监测，为远程医疗和紧急医疗干预提供基础。

Method: 使用Visual Studio .NET平台开发软件，通过Einthoven三角法放置电极，从串口读取实时心电图数据并在移动设备上图形化显示，设置阈值警报机制。

Result: 成功开发出完全便携的心电图监测系统，能够实时显示心电图信号并在异常时发出警报。

Conclusion: 该系统为未来多用途医疗系统（如在线患者监测、位置跟踪和除颤干预）奠定了基础，具有重要的临床应用前景。

Abstract: This study focuses on the connection of a development kit that enables
real-time monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using a mobile system.
A software developed on the Visual Studio .NET platform reads real-time ECG
signals from the human body through non invasive methods and displays them
graphically on the mobile system. ECG electrodes placed on specific areas of
the body using the method known as Einthoven's triangle. Subsequently, the
software initiates data flow through the serial port, and these data displayed
as signal values on the mobile device's screen via a graphical interface. When
the monitored ECG signals fall below a certain threshold or reach a critical
value, the system provides feedback with an alert based on medical data. The
developed system is fully portable. Additionally, the implemented system has
the potential to form the basis for a multi-purpose system in the future, such
as online patient monitoring, patient location tracking, and even initial
intervention using the defibrillation method.

### [3] [Adaptive Split-MMD Training for Small-Sample Cross-Dataset P300 EEG Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21969)
*Weiyu Chen,Arnaud Delorme*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出AS-MMD方法解决小样本P300检测中的跨数据集迁移学习问题，在严格小样本条件下显著优于目标域单独训练和池化训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG单次P300检测中因标注样本少而难以训练的问题，以及跨数据集迁移时出现的数据分布偏移挑战。

Method: 提出自适应分割最大均值差异训练(AS-MMD)，包含目标加权损失、分割批归一化和径向基核最大均值差异三个组件，基于EEG Conformer实现。

Result: 在两个视觉oddball ERP数据集上，AS-MMD在准确率和AUC指标上均优于目标域单独训练和池化训练，且提升具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: AS-MMD方法能有效解决小样本P300检测中的跨数据集迁移问题，三个组件都对性能提升有贡献，且方法具有骨干网络无关性和推理时模型不变性。

Abstract: Detecting single-trial P300 from EEG is difficult when only a few labeled
trials are available. When attempting to boost a small target set with a large
source dataset through transfer learning, cross-dataset shift arises. To
address this challenge, we study transfer between two public visual-oddball ERP
datasets using five shared electrodes (Fz, Pz, P3, P4, Oz) under a strict
small-sample regime (target: 10 trials/subject; source: 80 trials/subject). We
introduce Adaptive Split Maximum Mean Discrepancy Training (AS-MMD), which
combines (i) a target-weighted loss with warm-up tied to the square root of the
source/target size ratio, (ii) Split Batch Normalization (Split-BN) with shared
affine parameters and per-domain running statistics, and (iii) a parameter-free
logit-level Radial Basis Function kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (RBF-MMD)
term using the median-bandwidth heuristic. Implemented on an EEG Conformer,
AS-MMD is backbone-agnostic and leaves the inference-time model unchanged.
Across both transfer directions, it outperforms target-only and pooled training
(Active Visual Oddball: accuracy/AUC 0.66/0.74; ERP CORE P3: 0.61/0.65), with
gains over pooling significant under corrected paired t-tests. Ablations
attribute improvements to all three components.

Main category: eess.SP

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在真实ISAC环境中实现有效多目标跟踪的可行性，为集成感知与通信系统的实际应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: For a wide range of envisioned integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
use cases, it is necessary to incorporate tracking techniques into cellular
communication systems. While numerous multi-object tracking algorithms exist,
they have not yet been applied to real-world ISAC, with its challenges such as
clutter and non-optimal hardware. In this work, we showcase multi-object
tracking based on the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter in the range
and Doppler speed domain. The measurements are taken with a 5G compliant ISAC
proof-of-concept in a real factory environment, where the pedestrian-like
objects are generated by a radar object emulator. We detail the complete
pipeline, from measurement acquisition to evaluation, with a focus on the
post-processing of the raw captured data and the tracking itself. Our
end-to-end evaluation and comparison to simulations show good multi-object
tracking performance with mean absolute error <1.5m and detection rates >91%
for realistic but challenging scenarios.

### [5] [Angular Estimation Comparison with ISAC PoC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22297)
*Alexander Felix,Rudolf Hoffmann,Marcus Henninger,Stephan ten Brink,Silvio Mandelli*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 评估基于最小DFT角度采样的角度估计方法，发现插值方法在泛化性上更优，DFT插值整体表现最佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC系统采用模拟/混合波束成形结构会限制角度覆盖范围，需要基于最少角度采样实现目标角度估计和分离

Method: 使用ISAC概念验证系统在工业场景中扫描多个波束获取DFT角度采样，比较不同角度估计方法

Result: 插值方法在各类角度场景中泛化性更好；OMP对单个强目标估计最准确；DFT插值整体性能最佳

Conclusion: DFT插值方法在最小角度采样条件下提供了最优的整体角度估计性能

Abstract: The introduction of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) in cellular
systems is not expected to result in a shift away from the popular choice of
cost- and energy-efficient analog or hybrid beamforming structures. However,
this comes at the cost of limiting the angular capabilities to a confined space
per acquisitions. Thus, as a prerequisite for the successful implementation of
numerous ISAC use cases, the need for an optimal angular estimation of targets
and their separation based on the minimal number of angular samples arises.
  In this work, different approaches for angular estimation based on a minimal,
DFT-based set of angular samples are evaluated. The samples are acquired
through sweeping multiple beams of an ISAC proof of concept (PoC) in the
industrial scenario of the ARENA2036. The study's findings indicate that
interpolation approaches are more effective for generalizing across different
types of angular scenarios. While the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)
approach exhibits the most accurate estimation for a single, strong and clearly
discriminable target, the DFT-based interpolation approach demonstrates the
best overall estimation performance.

*Yohei Kono,Yoshiyuki Tajima*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为数据驱动指数框架（DEF）的方法，用于从少量数据中提取没有重复或奇异性的脉冲时间模式，通过线性动态系统模型和Hankel矩阵分析来量化模式持续时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在制造应用中，从少量数据中提取没有重复或奇异性的脉冲时间模式具有重要意义，但科学界对此关注不足。

Method: 基于时间延迟嵌入和数据驱动的Hankel矩阵分析，引入时间延迟坐标上的线性动态系统模型，推导具有不同指数衰减常数的离散时间基，并通过滑动窗口拟合子序列来量化模式持续时间。

Result: 玩具模型实验显示DEF能识别具有不同长度的多个模式，在冲压机电流测量中的应用表明其能从真实世界振荡数据中提取多个模式。

Conclusion: DEF方法能够有效量化时间模式的持续时间，为从少量数据中提取脉冲模式提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Extracting pulsive temporal patterns from a small dataset without their
repetition or singularity shows significant importance in manufacturing
applications but does not sufficiently attract scientific attention. We propose
to quantify how long temporal patterns appear without relying on their
repetition or singularity, enabling to extract such temporal patterns from a
small dataset. Inspired by the celebrated time delay embedding and data-driven
Hankel matrix analysis, we introduce a linear dynamical system model on the
time-delay coordinates behind the data to derive the discrete-time bases each
of which has a distinct exponential decay constant. The derived bases are
fitted onto subsequences that are extracted with a sliding window in order to
quantify how long patterns are dominant in the set of subsequences. We call the
quantification method Data-driven Exponential Framing (DEF). A toy model-based
experiment shows that DEF can identify multiple patterns with distinct lengths.
DEF is also applied to electric current measurement on a punching machine,
showing its possibility to extract multiple patterns from real-world
oscillatory data.

Conclusion: 所提小波框架为具有密集模态和复杂阻尼分布的机械系统提供了鲁棒的模态识别和降阶建模方法

Abstract: This work presents a purely data-driven, wavelet-based framework for modal
identification and reduced-order modeling of mechanical systems with assumed
linear dynamics characterized by closely spaced modes with classical or
non-classical damping distribution. Traditional Fourier-based methods often
fail to reliably identify closely spaced modes or accurately capture modal
interactions and complexities. To address these limitations, we propose a
methodology leveraging the enhanced time -frequency resolution capabilities of
the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). By selecting appropriate harmonic
regions within the wavelet spectra, we effectively isolate modes, and then
invert them back in the temporal domain by applying the inverse CWT (ICWT). In
this way we reconstruct the corresponding modal dynamics in the time domain.
Using the Hilbert transform, instantaneous phases are extracted for each
identified mode, enabling the introduction of a complexified modal matrix which
robustly characterizes the system's modal properties, even under challenging
perturbations such as noise and uncertainties due to modal interference and
unmodeled effects. The identified modal parameters are utilized to reconstruct
the frequency response functions (FRFs) of the system and to develop a
reduced-order model (ROM) that captures accurately the system's dominant
dynamical behavior valid in a specified frequency range.. Validation of the
methodology is conducted both with a numerical non-classical damping and an
experimental testbed representing a model of an airplane structure. Results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in resolving intricate
modal interactions and accurately reproducing the dynamic response of complex
structural systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一个规划导向的集成感知与通信框架，通过降低规划瓶颈障碍物的感知不确定性来提升自动驾驶车辆的安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ISAC设计主要关注感知精度和通信吞吐量，但忽视了关键障碍物对运动效率的影响，需要在物理层优化和运动规划之间建立桥梁。

Method: 推导了连接ISAC发射功率与感知不确定性的安全边界闭式解，构建了双层功率分配和运动规划问题，内层优化波束功率分布，外层计算不确定性感知的安全轨迹。

Conclusion: PISAC框架有效提升了自动驾驶车辆的安全性和效率，验证了规划导向ISAC设计的有效性。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables simultaneous
localization, environment perception, and data exchange for connected
autonomous vehicles. However, most existing ISAC designs prioritize sensing
accuracy and communication throughput, treating all targets uniformly and
overlooking the impact of critical obstacles on motion efficiency. To overcome
this limitation, we propose a planning-oriented ISAC (PISAC) framework that
reduces the sensing uncertainty of planning-bottleneck obstacles and expands
the safe navigable path for the ego-vehicle, thereby bridging the gap between
physical-layer optimization and motion-level planning. The core of PISAC lies
in deriving a closed-form safety bound that explicitly links ISAC transmit
power to sensing uncertainty, based on the Cram\'er-Rao Bound and occupancy
inflation principles. Using this model, we formulate a bilevel power allocation
and motion planning (PAMP) problem, where the inner layer optimizes the ISAC
beam power distribution and the outer layer computes a collision-free
trajectory under uncertainty-aware safety constraints. Comprehensive
simulations in high-fidelity urban driving environments demonstrate that PISAC
achieves up to 40% higher success rates and over 5% shorter traversal times
than existing ISAC-based and communication-oriented benchmarks, validating its
effectiveness in enhancing both safety and efficiency.

### [9] [Genetic Optimization of a Software-Defined GNSS Receiver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22417)
*Laura Train,Rodrigo Castellanos,Miguel Gómez-López*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于遗传算法的优化框架，用于自动优化GNSS接收机在高动态环境下的跟踪环路参数，解决传统接收机在高加速度条件下性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商用GNSS接收机在高动态环境（如火箭发射）中性能严重下降，传统跟踪环路带宽无法应对同步参数的快速变化。虽然软件定义无线电接收机具有灵活性，但手动调参复杂且难以保证最优性能。

Method: 使用遗传算法自主探索接收机配置空间，优化相位、频率和延迟跟踪的环路参数。在SDR环境中使用模拟GPS L1信号进行验证，涵盖火箭飞行、低地球轨道卫星和静态接收机三种动态场景。

Result: 优化后的配置在不同动态条件下均能保持稳健准确的PVT解：静态情况下最大位置和速度误差分别为6米和0.08米/秒；火箭情况下为12米和2.5米/秒；LEO情况下为5米和0.2米/秒。

Conclusion: 进化优化使SDR接收机能够在各种动态条件下保持稳健准确的定位性能，显著提升了高动态环境下的GNSS接收性能。

Abstract: Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
receivers face significant limitations under high-dynamic conditions,
particularly in high-acceleration environments such as those experienced by
launch vehicles. These performance degradations, often observed as
discontinuities in the navigation solution, arise from the inability of
traditional tracking loop bandwidths to cope with rapid variations in
synchronization parameters. Software-Defined Radio (SDR) receivers overcome
these constraints by enabling flexible reconfiguration of tracking loops;
however, manual tuning involves a complex, multidimensional search and seldom
ensures optimal performance. This work introduces a genetic algorithm-based
optimization framework that autonomously explores the receiver configuration
space to determine optimal loop parameters for phase, frequency, and delay
tracking. The approach is validated within an SDR environment using
realistically simulated GPS L1 signals for three representative dynamic regimes
-guided rocket flight, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite, and static
receiver-processed with the open-source GNSS-SDR architecture. Results
demonstrate that evolutionary optimization enables SDR receivers to maintain
robust and accurate Position, Velocity, and Time (PVT) solutions across diverse
dynamic conditions. The optimized configurations yielded maximum position and
velocity errors of approximately 6 m and 0.08 m/s for the static case, 12 m and
2.5 m/s for the rocket case, and 5 m and 0.2 m/s for the LEO case.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于CNN-GPT2的框架来解决毫米波通信中大规模天线阵列的近场波束预测问题，通过上行链路导频传输策略和深度学习模型联合预测角度和距离域的波束索引。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波通信中极大规模天线阵列的出现，特别是在高移动性场景下，凸显了近场波束预测的重要性。与传统远场假设不同，近场波束预测需要联合采样角度和距离域的码本，导致导频开销急剧增加，且最优波束索引呈现非线性的突变动态。

Method: 设计上行链路导频传输策略，通过宽波束模拟预编码和频率变化数字预编码实现高效信道探测。接收的导频信号经过预处理后，通过CNN特征提取器，再由GPT-2模型捕获多帧间的时序依赖关系，以端到端方式直接预测近场波束索引。

Result: 该方法能够有效应对近场波束预测中导频开销大和时序动态非线性的挑战，实现了高效的波束预测。

Conclusion: CNN-GPT2框架为毫米波通信中极大规模天线阵列的近场波束预测提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过深度学习模型成功解决了传统方法面临的挑战。

Abstract: The emergence of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA) in
millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications, particularly in high-mobility
scenarios, highlights the importance of near-field beam prediction. Unlike the
conventional far-field assumption, near-field beam prediction requires
codebooks that jointly sample the angular and distance domains, which leads to
a dramatic increase in pilot overhead. Moreover, unlike the far-field case
where the optimal beam evolution is temporally smooth, the optimal near-field
beam index exhibits abrupt and nonlinear dynamics due to its joint dependence
on user angle and distance, posing significant challenges for temporal
modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural
Network-Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (CNN-GPT2) based near-field beam
prediction framework. Specifically, an uplink pilot transmission strategy is
designed to enable efficient channel probing through widebeam analog precoding
and frequency-varying digital precoding. The received pilot signals are
preprocessed and passed through a CNN-based feature extractor, followed by a
GPT-2 model that captures temporal dependencies across multiple frames and
directly predicts the near-field beam index in an end-to-end manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统被动RIS存在级联信道结构复杂、导频开销大的问题，而主动RIS通过信号放大提高了实际部署的可行性，但需要有效的信道估计方法。

Result: 仿真表明该方法使用极少导频即可达到接近最优性能，相比被动RIS在相同总功率预算下获得更高的频谱效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的参数化信道估计方法有效解决了主动RIS的信道获取难题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology has emerged as a key
enabler for future wireless communications. However, its potential is
constrained by the difficulty of acquiring accurate user-to-RIS channel state
information (CSI), due to the cascaded channel structure and the high pilot
overhead of non-parametric methods. Unlike a passive RIS, where the reflected
signal suffers from multiplicative path loss, an active RIS amplifies the
signal, improving its practicality in real deployments. In this letter, we
propose a parametric channel estimation method tailored for active RISs. The
proposed approach integrates an active RIS model with an adaptive Maximum
Likelihood Estimator (MLE) to recover the main channel parameters using a
minimal number of pilots. To further enhance performance, an adaptive active
RIS configuration strategy is employed, which refines the beam direction based
on an initial user location estimate. Moreover, an orthogonal angle-pair
codebook is used instead of the conventional Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
codebook, significantly reducing the codebook size and ensuring reliable
operation for both far-field and near-field users. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-optimal performance with
very few pilots compared to non-parametric approaches. Its performance is also
benchmarked against that of a traditional passive RIS under the same total
power budget to ensure fairness. Results show that active RIS yields higher
spectral efficiency (SE) by eliminating the multiplicative fading inherent in
passive RISs and allocating more resources to data transmission

Motivation: 现有的RF指纹识别技术依赖专用设备捕获IQ样本，阻碍了广泛应用。虽然商用WiFi设备可轻松获取CSI用于轻量级RF指纹识别，但在开放世界设置中面临CSI测量粒度粗的挑战。

Method: 首先将频域CSI测量转换为与IQ样本共享特征空间的时域信号，然后采用深度辅助学习策略从IQ指纹模型向CSI模型迁移有用知识，最后结合OpenMax函数估计未知设备的可能性。

Result: 在包含85个设备的合成CSI数据集和分别包含10个和25个WiFi路由器的两个真实CSI数据集上评估，系统在合成CSI数据集上准确率至少提高16%，在实验室CSI数据集上提高20%，在野外CSI数据集上提高17%。

Conclusion: CSI2Q系统成功解决了CSI测量在开放世界设置中的粒度问题，实现了与IQ方法相媲美的性能，为轻量级RF指纹识别提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting techniques provide a promising supplement
to cryptography-based approaches but rely on dedicated equipment to capture
in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples, hindering their wide adoption. Recent
advances advocate easily obtainable channel state information (CSI) by
commercial WiFi devices for lightweight RF fingerprinting, while falling short
in addressing the challenges of coarse granularity of CSI measurements in an
open-world setting. In this paper, we propose CSI2Q, a novel CSI fingerprinting
system that achieves comparable performance to IQ-based approaches. Instead of
extracting fingerprints directly from raw CSI measurements, CSI2Q first
transforms frequency-domain CSI measurements into time-domain signals that
share the same feature space with IQ samples. Then, we employ a deep auxiliary
learning strategy to transfer useful knowledge from an IQ fingerprinting model
to the CSI counterpart. Finally, the trained CSI model is combined with an
OpenMax function to estimate the likelihood of unknown ones. We evaluate CSI2Q
on one synthetic CSI dataset involving 85 devices and two real CSI datasets,
including 10 and 25 WiFi routers, respectively. Our system achieves accuracy
increases of at least 16% on the synthetic CSI dataset, 20% on the in-lab CSI
dataset, and 17% on the in-the-wild CSI dataset.

Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) is attractive for unobtrusive

for edge deployment, and even lightweight ViT/SSM variants often exceed
practical compute and memory budgets. We introduce Neural-HAR, a
dimension-gated CNN accelerator tailored for real-time radar HAR on

TL;DR: 提出了一种带带宽约束的鲁棒模态分解方法，结合了数值优化和谱分解方法的优点，通过相空间映射和带宽约束增强抗噪能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模态分解方法存在局限性：数值优化方法缺乏物理约束会产生虚假模态，谱分解方法对噪声敏感且难以处理非线性信号，需要结合两者优势的方法

Method: 提出RMD方法，通过将时间序列映射到相空间的轨迹-GRAM矩阵来保持信号内在结构，并在分解过程中加入带宽约束

Conclusion: RMD方法有效结合了两种模态分解方法的优势，具有鲁棒性和通用性，代码和数据集已在GitHub开源

Abstract: Modal decomposition techniques, such as Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD),
Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA),
have advanced time-frequency signal analysis since the early 21st century.
These methods are generally classified into two categories: numerical
optimization-based methods (EMD, VMD) and spectral decomposition methods (SSA)
that consider the physical meaning of signals. The former can produce spurious
modes due to the lack of physical constraints, while the latter is more
sensitive to noise and struggles with nonlinear signals. Despite continuous
improvements in these methods, a modal decomposition approach that effectively
combines the strengths of both categories remains elusive. This paper thus
proposes a Robust Modal Decomposition (RMD) method with constrained bandwidth,
which preserves the intrinsic structure of the signal by mapping the time
series into its trajectory-GRAM matrix in phase space. Moreover, the method
incorporates bandwidth constraints during the decomposition process, enhancing
noise resistance. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets,
including millimeter-wave radar echoes, electrocardiogram (ECG),
phonocardiogram (PCG), and bearing fault detection data, demonstrate the
method's effectiveness and versatility. All code and dataset samples are
available on GitHub: https://github.com/Einstein-sworder/RMD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上肢无力和震颤（4-12 Hz）限制了日常生活活动能力，并降低了家庭康复的依从性，需要开发能够提供实时辅助的可穿戴设备来改善康复效果。

Method: 设计轻量级传感器节点，集成表面肌电（1 kHz）、IMU（100-200 Hz）和弯曲/力传感器，采用Tiny 1D-CNN/Transformer进行INT8量化推理，实施安全约束辅助策略（角度/扭矩/加速度限制；失速/超时保护）。12名健康成人执行三项日常生活活动任务，评估震颤指数、运动范围、重复次数等指标。

Abstract: Background: Upper-limb weakness and tremor (4--12 Hz) limit activities of
daily living (ADL) and reduce adherence to home rehabilitation. Objective: To
assess technical feasibility and clinician-relevant signals of a sensor-fused
wearable targeting the triceps brachii and extensor pollicis brevis. Methods: A
lightweight node integrates surface EMG (1 kHz), IMU (100--200 Hz), and
flex/force sensors with on-device INT8 inference (Tiny 1D-CNN/Transformer) and
a safety-bounded assist policy (angle/torque/jerk limits; stall/time-out).
Healthy adults (n = 12) performed three ADL-like tasks. Primary outcomes:
Tremor Index (TI), range of motion (ROM), repetitions (Reps min$^{-1}$).
Secondary: EMG median-frequency slope (fatigue trend), closed-loop latency,
session completion, and device-related adverse events. Analyses used
subject-level paired medians with BCa 95\% CIs; exact Wilcoxon $p$-values are
reported in the Results. Results: Assistance was associated with lower tremor
prominence and improved task throughput: TI decreased by $-0.092$ (95\% CI
[$-0.102$, $-0.079$]), ROM increased by $+12.65\%$ (95\% CI [$+8.43$,
$+13.89$]), and Reps rose by $+2.99$ min$^{-1}$ (95\% CI [$+2.61$, $+3.35$]).
Median on-device latency was 8.7 ms at a 100 Hz loop rate; all sessions were
completed with no device-related adverse events. Conclusions: Multimodal
sensing with low-latency, safety-bounded assistance produced improved movement
quality (TI $\downarrow$) and throughput (ROM, Reps $\uparrow$) in a pilot
technical-feasibility setting, supporting progression to IRB-approved patient
studies. Trial registration: Not applicable (pilot non-clinical).

Abstract: The development of the low-altitude economy has led to a growing prominence
of uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) safety management issues. Therefore, accurate
identification, real-time localization, and effective countermeasures have
become core challenges in airspace security assurance. This paper introduces an
integrated UAV management and control system based on deep learning, which
integrates multimodal multi-sensor fusion perception, precise positioning, and
collaborative countermeasures. By incorporating deep learning methods, the
system combines radio frequency (RF) spectral feature analysis, radar
detection, electro-optical identification, and other methods at the detection
level to achieve the identification and classification of UAVs. At the
localization level, the system relies on multi-sensor data fusion and the
air-space-ground integrated communication network to conduct real-time tracking
and prediction of UAV flight status, providing support for early warning and
decision-making. At the countermeasure level, it adopts comprehensive measures
that integrate ``soft kill'' and ``hard kill'', including technologies such as
electromagnetic signal jamming, navigation spoofing, and physical interception,
to form a closed-loop management and control process from early warning to
final disposal, which significantly enhances the response efficiency and
disposal accuracy of low-altitude UAV management.

Conclusion: PASS增强的MEC架构结合自适应上行链路波束成形，能够有效提高任务卸载效率并改善延迟性能，是高频MEC系统的有前景解决方案。

Abstract: A pinching-antenna system (PASS)-enhanced mobile edge computing (MEC)
architecture is investigated to improve the task offloading efficiency and
latency performance in dynamic wireless environments. By leveraging dielectric
waveguides and flexibly adjustable pinching antennas, PASS establishes
short-distance line-of-sight (LoS) links while effectively mitigating the
significant path loss and potential signal blockage, making it a promising
solution for high-frequency MEC systems. We formulate a network latency
minimization problem to joint optimize uplink PASS beamforming and task
offloading. The resulting problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP)
and solved via the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method. To address the
instability introduced by the $\max$ operator in the objective function, we
propose a load balancing-aware proximal policy optimization (LBPPO) algorithm.
LBPPO incorporates both node-level and waveguide-level load balancing
information into the policy design, maintaining computational and transmission
delay equilibrium, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed PASS-enhanced MEC with adaptive uplink PASS beamforming exhibit
stronger convergence capability than fixed-PA baselines and conventional
MIMO-assisted MEC, especially in scenarios with a large number of UEs or high
transmit power.

Motivation: 解决未来大规模机器类型通信场景中对大规模连接和低接入延迟的迫切需求，克服传统正交多址接入在无协调随机接入中的性能限制。

Method: 将经典的时隙ALOHA协议与稀疏码多址接入技术相结合，提出SCMA赋能的URA方案，采用干扰消除优先的解码策略，并引入用户阻拦机制来管理流量负载。

Conclusion: SCMA赋能的URA方案通过集成SCMA技术和干扰消除解码策略，显著提高了无协调随机接入系统的吞吐量性能，用户阻拦机制有效缓解了拥塞情况下的吞吐量下降问题。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel uncoordinated random access (URA) protocol is
presented to address the pressing demand for massive connectivity with low
access latency in future massive machine type communication (mMTC) scenarios.
The proposed URA scheme integrates the classical slotted ALOHA (S-ALOHA)
protocol with sparse code multiple access (SCMA) technique, referred to as
SCMA-empowered URA. Specifically, active users randomly choose an SCMA codebook
to access the communication network in an arbitrary time slot whenever they
want without scheduling. However, due to the lack of central coordination in
the proposed URA scheme, SCMA codebook collisions become inevitable, making
decoding challenging and leading to increased access failures. To cope with the
decoding issue, an interference-canceling (IC) first decoding strategy is
proposed at the access point (AP), which can partially tackles collision
problems, contributing to a higher system throughput. Taking the proposed
IC-first decoding strategy into account, a closed-form theoretical expression
of the throughput is derived. Moreover, to alleviate the throughput degradation
under the congested user traffic, a user barring mechanism is introduced to
manage the traffic load. Firstly, a closed-form expression of idle codebook
probability is developed to help indicate the system state, i.e., congested or
not. Then, in addition to the estimated real-time load, the AP adaptively
adjusts the access probability and redistributes the actual access load.
Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCMA-empowered URA
scheme enjoys higher maximum throughput, compared to the conventional
orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based URA scheme. Moreover, the accuracy of
the presented theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the user barring
mechanism are verified.

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) represent a key enabler for
next-generation wireless networks, offering beamforming gains while
significantly reducing radio-frequency chain requirements. In conventional
space-only SIM architectures, the rate of reconfigurability of the SIM is equal
to the inverse of the channel coherence time. This paper investigates a novel
beamforming strategy for massive downlink connectivity using a randomized
space-time (ST) coded SIM. In addition to conventional space-only metasurface
layers, the proposed design integrates a ST metasurface layer at the input
stage of the SIM that introduces random time variations over each channel
coherence time interval. These artificial time variations enable opportunistic
user scheduling and exploitation of multiuser diversity under slow channel
dynamics. To mitigate the prohibitive overhead associated with full channel
state information at the transmitter (CSIT), we propose a partial-CSIT-based
beamforming scheme that leverages randomized steering vectors and limited
user-side feedback based on signal quality measurements. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed ST-SIM architecture achieves satisfactory
sum-rate performance while significantly reducing CSIT acquisition and feedback
overhead, thereby enabling scalable downlink connectivity in dense networks.

Conclusion: PASS框架通过联合优化天线激活和功率分配，能够有效实现同时同频上下行传输，显著提升系统性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel joint uplink and downlink framework
utilizing a pinching antenna system (PASS). We consider two waveguides, one
dedicated to transmission and one to reception, and both of them are connected
to a base station (BS). Each type of waveguide consists of several pinching
antennas (PAs) in some preconfigured positions. In this framework, we assume
the BS can serve downlink and uplink user equipments (UEs) at the same time
using the same spectrum resources through the presented PASS. In this aspect,
we formulate a sum rate optimization problem that jointly optimizes the antenna
activation factor, the BS transmit power, and the UE's transmit power, subject
to power budget constraints for the BS and the UEs, as well as minimum rate
requirements for the UEs. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and
difficult to solve directly. Hence, we divide the main problem into two
sub-problems: the antenna activation sub-problem and the power allocation
sub-problem. Then, we solve the antenna activation problem utilizing a distance
and spatial correlation-based algorithm. Meanwhile, the resource allocation
problem is solved using a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based
algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed framework can achieve
around 60-90\% performance gains over its time division duplex (TDD) where the
uplink and downlink transmissions are served in different orthogonal time
slots.

Abstract: Instant payment infrastructures have stringent performance requirements,
processing millions of transactions daily with zero-downtime expectations.
Traditional monitoring approaches fail to bridge the gap between technical
infrastructure metrics and business process visibility. We introduce a novel
feature engineering approach based on processing times computed between
consecutive ISO 20022 message exchanges, creating a compact representation of
system state. By applying anomaly detection to these features, we enable early
failure detection and localization, allowing incident classification.
Experimental evaluation on the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system,
using both real-world incidents and controlled simulations, demonstrates the
approach's effectiveness in detecting diverse anomaly patterns and provides
inherently interpretable explanations that enable operators to understand the
business impact. By mapping features to distinct processing phases, the
resulting framework differentiates between internal and external payment system
issues, significantly reduces investigation time, and bridges observability
gaps in distributed systems where transaction state is fragmented across
multiple entities.

Abstract: Transformers trained in low precision can suffer forward-error amplification.
We give a first-order, module-wise theory that predicts when and where errors
grow. For self-attention we derive a per-layer bound that factorizes into three
interpretable diagnostics: a score-scale ratio $\kappa_{\rm score}$, a rowwise
softmax sensitivity $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$, and value conditioning $\kappa(V)$.
We prove a residual relaxation inequality showing that residual blocks
attenuate depth-wise accumulation, and we introduce a precision- and
width-aware LayerNorm indicator $\rho_{\rm LN}$ with a matching first-order
bound in the $\epsilon$-dominated regime. These pieces yield a unified
forward-stability bound whose right-hand side is directly estimable during
training.
  On Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10 we evaluate the bound and components. (1) The combined
predictor $\kappa_{\rm softmax},(1+\kappa_{\rm
score}),\kappa(V),|W_O|2+\kappa{\rm eff}+C_{\rm LN}$ tracks
FP32$\leftrightarrow$LP mismatches across seeds, widths, and precisions;
scaling by $\epsilon_{\rm mach}$ collapses mixed-precision points. (2) The
time-series maximum of $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$ acts as an early-warning signal,
leading error spikes by 16-24 steps (corr. 0.65-0.82; permutation
$p!\approx!10^{-3}$; Precision@K 0.89-1.00). (3) Guided by $\rho_{\rm LN}$, a
small LayerNorm-$\epsilon$ tweak targeting $\rho_\star$ gives consistent
stabilization (mean tail-loss $\downarrow\ \approx0.010$ at $\rho_\star!=!0.6$,
cap$=10^{-2}$) with negligible overhead.
  Overall, our theory supplies actionable, unitless diagnostics that (i)
explain when self-attention is fragile, (ii) forecast instability, and (iii)
motivate a minimally invasive mitigation.

Conclusion: CMR证明直接引导模型进入良好条件区域可以实现稳定、准确的学习，支持优化驱动的谱预处理方法。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)}, a simple,
architecture-agnostic loss that directly optimizes layer spectra. CMR jointly
controls spectral edges via a log-condition proxy and shapes the interior via
Chebyshev moments, with a decoupled, capped mixing rule that preserves task
gradients. We prove strictly monotone descent for the condition proxy, bounded
moment gradients, and orthogonal invariance. In an adversarial
``$\kappa$-stress'' setting (MNIST, 15-layer MLP), \emph{compared to vanilla
training}, CMR reduces mean layer condition numbers by $\sim\!10^3$ (from
$\approx3.9\!\times\!10^3$ to $\approx3.4$ in 5 epochs), increases average
gradient magnitude, and restores test accuracy (
$\approx10\%\!\to\!\approx86\%$ ). These results support
\textbf{optimization-driven spectral preconditioning}: directly steering models

  Results: Our ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 and 77.3\% sensitivity on a
held-out test set. Maximum daily opioid dose, length of stay, and patient age
emerged as the most important predictors. ATE analysis identified significant
causative factors: opioids (0.25 +/- 0.06) and operative site (neck: 0.20 +/-
0.13, head: 0.19 +/- 0.13). Despite equal surgery rates across genders, men
were 1.5 times more likely to aspirate and received 27\% higher maximum daily
opioid dosages compared to women.
  Conclusion: ML models can effectively predict postoperative aspiration risk,
enabling targeted preventative measures. Maximum daily opioid dosage and
operative site significantly influence aspiration risk. The gender disparity in
both opioid administration and aspiration rates warrants further investigation.
These findings have important implications for improving postoperative care
protocols and aspiration prevention strategies.

Conclusion: 提出了结合多个专家提升聚合模型性能的新方法和无遗憾保证，为专家混合学习提供了理论基础和实践框架。

Abstract: We explore the use of expert-guided bandit learning, which we refer to as
online mixture-of-experts (OMoE). In this setting, given a context, a candidate
committee of experts must determine how to aggregate their outputs to achieve
optimal results in terms of aggregate accuracy. We propose two algorithms to
address this problem. The first algorithm combines aggregate voting with
UCB-driven successive elimination, efficiently pruning suboptimal exploration
actions. The second algorithm employs an online weighted-majority-voting
mechanism, leveraging the respective voting power of each expert proportional
to their predictive power. We derive theoretical guarantees for the regret
properties in the bandit setting under ideal circumstances, and empirical
results are provided accordingly. As a modern study on applications, these
methods are applied to the online fine-tuning of a set of expert large language
models (LLMs), where after each response, the generative LLM dynamically
reweighs its set of experts and/or selects the optimal committee of experts to
generate the most accurate response. Our results introduce new methodologies
and no-regret guarantees for combining multiple experts to improve on the
performance of the an aggregate model overall.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种统计测量扩散模型预测误差的方法，并开发了方差减少引导（VRG）技术来减轻这种误差，无需模型微调或修改即可提高生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的采样过程涉及多个步骤，每个步骤的预测误差会累积并降低生成质量，需要一种方法来减轻这种误差。

Method: VRG方法通过搜索新的采样轨迹来减少预测误差，保持相同的采样步数但产生更高质量的结果，适用于条件和非条件生成。

Result: 在多个数据集和基线模型上的实验表明，VRG能显著提高扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: VRG是一种有效的方法，能够在不修改模型的情况下减少扩散模型中的预测误差累积，提升生成性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become emerging generative models. Their sampling
process involves multiple steps, and in each step the models predict the noise
from a noisy sample. When the models make prediction, the output deviates from
the ground truth, and we call such a deviation as \textit{prediction error}.
The prediction error accumulates over the sampling process and deteriorates
generation quality. This paper introduces a novel technique for statistically
measuring the prediction error and proposes the Variance-Reduction Guidance
(VRG) method to mitigate this error. VRG does not require model fine-tuning or
modification. Given a predefined sampling trajectory, it searches for a new
trajectory which has the same number of sampling steps but produces higher
quality results. VRG is applicable to both conditional and unconditional
generation. Experiments on various datasets and baselines demonstrate that VRG
can significantly improve the generation quality of diffusion models. Source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MJO是全球天气和气候极端事件的重要驱动因子，但在业务动力模型中的预报仍具挑战性，有效预报通常仅限于3-4周。

Method: 两阶段模型：首先使用物理信息3D U-Net修正时空场误差，然后使用针对预报技巧优化的LSTM细化MJO的RMM指数。

Result: 应用于CMA、ECMWF和NCEP三个不同业务预报时，统一框架将有效预报范围（双变量相关>0.5）一致延长2-8天，有效缓解"海洋大陆障碍"。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一条物理一致、计算高效且高度可推广的途径，以突破次季节预报中长期存在的障碍。

Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is an important driver of global weather
and climate extremes, but its prediction in operational dynamical models
remains challenging, with skillful forecasts typically limited to 3-4 weeks.
Here, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, the Physics-guided Cascaded
Corrector for MJO (PCC-MJO), which acts as a universal post-processor to
correct MJO forecasts from dynamical models. This two-stage model first employs
a physics-informed 3D U-Net to correct spatial-temporal field errors, then
refines the MJO's RMM index using an LSTM optimized for forecast skill. When
applied to three different operational forecasts from CMA, ECMWF and NCEP, our
unified framework consistently extends the skillful forecast range (bivariate
correlation > 0.5) by 2-8 days. Crucially, the model effectively mitigates the
"Maritime Continent barrier", enabling more realistic eastward propagation and
amplitude. Explainable AI analysis quantitatively confirms that the model's
decision-making is spatially congruent with observed MJO dynamics (correlation
> 0.93), demonstrating that it learns physically meaningful features rather
than statistical fittings. Our work provides a promising physically consistent,
computationally efficient, and highly generalizable pathway to break through
longstanding barriers in subseasonal forecasting.

Abstract: Current mainstream approaches to addressing multimodal imbalance primarily
focus on architectural modifications and optimization-based, often overlooking
a quantitative analysis of the imbalance degree between modalities. To address
this gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of
multi-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level
adaptive loss function.We begin by defining the "Modality Gap" as the
difference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and
visual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap
distribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM). These two components are found to correspond respectively
to "modality-balanced" and "modality-imbalanced" data samples. Subsequently, we
apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each sample
belonging to these two distinct distributions.Informed by this quantitative
analysis, we design a novel adaptive loss function with three objectives: (1)
to minimize the overall Modality Gap; (2) to encourage the imbalanced sample
distribution to shift towards the balanced one; and (3) to apply greater
penalty weights to imbalanced samples. We employ a two-stage training strategy
consisting of a warm-up phase followed by an adaptive training
phase.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the public CREMA-D and AVE datasets,
attaining accuracies of $80.65\%$ and $70.90\%$, respectively. This validates
the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Matrix-based preconditioned optimizers, such as Muon, have recently been
shown to be more efficient than scalar-based optimizers for training
large-scale neural networks, including large language models (LLMs). On the
other hand, recent benchmarks on optimizers for LLM pre-training have
demonstrated that variance-reduction techniques such as MARS can achieve
substantial speedups over standard optimizers that do not employ variance
reduction. In this paper, to achieve the best of both worlds, we introduce
MARS-M, a new optimizer that integrates the variance reduction technique in
MARS with Muon. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove that Muon-M
converges to a first-order stationary point at a rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, which improves upon
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ rate attained by Muon. Our empirical results on
language modeling and computer vision tasks demonstrate that MARS-M
consistently yields lower losses and improved performance across various
downstream benchmarks. The implementation of MARS-M is available at
https://github.com/AGI-Arena/MARS/MARS_M.

Result: 首次实现超过10,000时间步的稳定加速模拟，对未见边界条件具有鲁棒泛化能力，可扩展到3D流动，速度提升达4.98倍，热场相对误差约1E-3，低幅速度动态误差低于1E-2 ms-1。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一个成熟且可扩展的混合方法，为实际工程应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Purely data-driven surrogates for fluid dynamics often fail catastrophically
from error accumulation, while existing hybrid methods have lacked the
automation and robustness for practical use. To solve this, we developed
XRePIT, a novel hybrid simulation strategy that synergizes machine learning
(ML) acceleration with solver-based correction. We specifically designed our
method to be fully automated and physics-aware, ensuring the stability and
practical applicability that previous approaches lacked. We demonstrate that
this new design overcomes long-standing barriers, achieving the first stable,
accelerated rollouts for over 10,000 timesteps. The method also generalizes
robustly to unseen boundary conditions and, crucially, scales to 3D flows. Our
approach delivers speedups up to 4.98$\times$ while maintaining high physical
fidelity, resolving thermal fields with relative errors of ~1E-3 and capturing
low magnitude velocity dynamics with errors below 1E-2 ms-1. This work thus
establishes a mature and scalable hybrid method, paving the way for its use in
real-world engineering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机场雾预测模型在地理泛化方面的挑战，传统机器学习模型依赖位置特定特征，难以在不同地点间迁移。

Method: 使用梯度提升分类器(XGBoost)，基于基本热力学和辐射过程构建无坐标特征集，在智利圣地亚哥训练，在智利、美国、英国等地进行零样本测试。

Result: 模型在相距11650公里的不同雾况下AUC达到0.923-0.947，SHAP分析显示能见度持续性、太阳角度和热梯度是主要预测因子。

Conclusion: 基于物理信息的无坐标特征工程可以产生地理可迁移的大气预测工具。

Abstract: Short-term forecasting of airport fog (visibility < 1.0 km) presents
challenges in geographic generalization because many machine learning models
rely on location-specific features and fail to transfer across sites. This
study investigates whether fundamental thermodynamic and radiative processes
can be encoded in a coordinate-free (location-independent) feature set to
enable geographic transferability. A gradient boosting classifier (XGBoost)
trained on Santiago, Chile (SCEL, 33S) data from 2002-2009 was evaluated on a
2010-2012 holdout set and under strict zero-shot tests at Puerto Montt (SCTE),
San Francisco (KSFO), and London (EGLL). The model achieved AUC values of
0.923-0.947 across distances up to 11,650 km and different fog regimes
(radiative, advective, marine). Consistent SHAP feature rankings show that
visibility persistence, solar angle, and thermal gradients dominate
predictions, suggesting the model learned transferable physical relationships
rather than site-specific patterns. Results suggest that physics-informed,
coordinate-free feature engineering can yield geographically transferable
atmospheric forecasting tools.

Motivation: 高维数据集的激增需要既准确又可解释的机器学习模型，传统深度学习方法缺乏透明度，阻碍了在关键决策应用中的部署。

Method: 使用分层注意力机制、降维技术和解释驱动损失函数，通过梯度加权注意力提供特征级可解释性，通过原型表示提供全局模型解释。

Conclusion: HAIN通过协调预测准确性和可解释性，推进了精准医学和监管合规的透明AI解决方案的发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as genomics,
healthcare, and finance has created an urgent need for machine learning models
that are both highly accurate and inherently interpretable. While traditional
deep learning approaches deliver strong predictive performance, their lack of
transparency often impedes their deployment in critical, decision-sensitive
applications. In this work, we introduce the Hierarchical Attention-based
Interpretable Network (HAIN), a novel architecture that unifies multi-level
attention mechanisms, dimensionality reduction, and explanation-driven loss
functions to deliver interpretable and robust analysis of complex biomedical
data. HAIN provides feature-level interpretability via gradientweighted
attention and offers global model explanations through prototype-based
representations. Comprehensive evaluation on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
dataset demonstrates that HAIN achieves a classification accuracy of 94.3%,
surpassing conventional post-hoc interpretability approaches such as SHAP and
LIME in both transparency and explanatory power. Furthermore, HAIN effectively
identifies biologically relevant cancer biomarkers, supporting its utility for
clinical and research applications. By harmonizing predictive accuracy with
interpretability, HAIN advances the development of transparent AI solutions for
precision medicine and regulatory compliance.

Motivation: 时间序列是高维复杂数据对象，其高效搜索和索引一直是数据挖掘领域的长期挑战。本文旨在评估新提出的MDD相似性度量相对于广泛使用的DTW方法的比较优势和局限性。

Method: 使用多尺度Dubuc距离(MDD)评估时间序列相似性，该方法通过多时间尺度评估并避免点对点对齐。通过模拟实验和UCR档案中的95个数据集进行测试，并将两种方法应用于实际分类任务。

Result: 研究表明，在许多场景下MDD显著优于DTW，特别是在性能差距较大的情况下。在真实世界分类任务中，MDD相比DTW带来了显著改进。

Conclusion: MDD作为一种新型时间序列相似性度量方法，在多尺度评估和避免点对点对齐方面具有独特优势，在实际应用中表现出比DTW更好的性能，具有重要的实用价值。

Abstract: Time series are high-dimensional and complex data objects, making their
efficient search and indexing a longstanding challenge in data mining. Building
on a recently introduced similarity measure, namely Multiscale Dubuc Distance
(MDD), this paper investigates its comparative strengths and limitations
relative to the widely used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). MDD is novel in two key
ways: it evaluates time series similarity across multiple temporal scales and
avoids point-to-point alignment. We demonstrate that in many scenarios where
MDD outperforms DTW, the gains are substantial, and we provide a detailed
analysis of the specific performance gaps it addresses. We provide simulations,
in addition to the 95 datasets from the UCR archive, to test our hypotheses.
Finally, we apply both methods to a challenging real-world classification task
and show that MDD yields a significant improvement over DTW, underscoring its
practical utility.

Motivation: 现实世界代码编辑场景中，奖励分布往往偏斜且包含不可预测的异常值，导致优势计算失真和噪声增加，现有方法如GRPO难以有效处理。

Method: GAPO自适应地为每个提示找到无异常值的高密度区间，使用该区间中位数作为自适应Q值替代组均值进行优势计算，保持即插即用和高效率。

Conclusion: GAPO能鲁棒处理偏斜分布，在代码编辑任务中提供更稳定的强化学习性能，代码已公开。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for post-training large language
models (LLMs) in code editing, where group-relative methods like GRPO are
popular for their critic-free, normalized advantage estimation. However, in
real-world code-editing scenarios, reward distributions are often skewed with
unpredictable outliers, leading to distorted advantage computation and
increased noise. To address this issue, we propose Group Adaptive Policy
Optimization (GAPO), which adaptively finds an outlier-free highest-density
interval (HDI) per prompt and then uses the median of that interval as an
adaptive Q to replace the group mean in advantage calculation. This adaptive Q
robustly handles skewed distributions while remaining plug-and-play and
efficient. We validate GAPO on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) using a
large internal dataset of 51,844 real-world, history-aware code-editing tasks
across 10 languages, demonstrating consistent improvements in exact match
accuracy over GRPO and its variant DAPO. Code is publicly available.

Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法主要针对密集模型设计，忽视了剪枝模型的特性，导致性能恢复效果不佳

Method: 通过对比性探测关键注意力头，从激活差异中提取丢失组件，然后将其注入到对应的剪枝头中进行补偿

Result: 在通用和任务特定性能恢复方面均优于现有最优方法，且不损害剪枝模型的稀疏性和推理效率

Conclusion: RestoreLCC提供了一种有效的剪枝模型性能恢复方案，适用于结构化、半结构化和非结构化剪枝方案

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to reduce the size and inference cost of
large language models (LLMs), but it often causes performance degradation. To
mitigate this, existing restoration methods typically employ
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, to recover the pruned
model's performance. However, most PEFT methods are designed for dense models
and overlook the distinct properties of pruned models, often resulting in
suboptimal recovery. In this work, we propose a targeted restoration strategy
for pruned models that restores performance while preserving their low cost and
high efficiency. We observe that pruning-induced information loss is reflected
in attention activations, and selectively reintroducing components of this
information can significantly recover model performance. Based on this insight,
we introduce RestoreLCC (Restoring Pruned LLMs via Lost Component
Compensation), a plug-and-play method that contrastively probes critical
attention heads via activation editing, extracts lost components from
activation differences, and finally injects them back into the corresponding
pruned heads for compensation and recovery. RestoreLCC is compatible with
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured pruning schemes. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RestoreLCC consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both general and task-specific performance
recovery, without compromising the sparsity or inference efficiency of pruned
models.

Conclusion: 该架构在减少事实幻觉和提高效率方面表现优越，尽管在ROUGE-L得分上比直接视觉到语言模型低3.5%。

Abstract: Manually generating catchy descriptions and names is labor intensive and a
slow process for retailers. Although generative AI provides an automation
solution in form of Vision to Language Models (VLM), the current VLMs are prone
to factual "hallucinations". Siloed, single task models are not only
inefficient but also fail to capture interdependent relationships between
features. To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task
system that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image.
The contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture.
First, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision
encoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute
prediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second,
introduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own
predicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to
improve factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of
this architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent
price regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification,
with a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation
process proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from
12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical
ablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the
autoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to
direct vision to language model of similar size. One minor caveat is that the
model does perform 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language model on ROUGE-L
score.

Conclusion: COLA框架使大语言模型能够高效学习新任务，对先前任务性能影响极小，且无需保留早期训练数据，为持续学习提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Learning a set of tasks over time, also known as continual learning (CL), is
one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence due to
catastrophic forgetting. Large language models (LLMs) are often impractical to
frequent re-training and continual learning , due to high cost of computational
resources for training. Moreover, LLM are not suitable for continual learning
as updating these models over time for acquiring new knowledge leads to
overwrites existing knowledge leading to common phenomenon know as
\textit{catastrophic forgetting}. In this paper, we aim to address these
concerns using a novel framework , COLA that employs an autoencoder to learn
capture low-dimensional embeddings of the weights associated with various
tasks. Our approach facilitates the transfer of knowledge to new tasks while
preventing catastrophic forgetting, all without using data replay or a
substantial set of task-specific parameters. Our approach, COLA, makes the LLM
efficiently learn new tasks with minimal training, insignificant performance
degradation on previous tasks, and eliminates the need for retaining earlier
training data. Empirical evaluation on different datasets ranging from task
oriented dialouge system to intent classsfication datasets showcases that our
method not only overcomes catastrophic forgetting but also achieves significant
reduction in parameter usage and memory size, across multiple tasks and
outperforming the existing state of the art methods across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA drive rapid progress in
generative AI, yet their huge parameter scales create severe computational and
environmental burdens. High training costs, energy use, and limited device
deployment hinder accessibility. Existing compression - pruning, distillation,
low-rank, and quantization - reduces size but ignores complex inter-layer
correlations. We propose KARIPAP, a quantum-inspired tensor network compression

Renormalization Group (TRG) contraction. Unlike 1D Matrix Product States, iPEPS
captures multi-directional entanglement in attention and deep transformer
layers. TRG ensures polynomial-time contraction, making tensorization feasible
while preserving key correlation geometry. Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B show up to
93% memory and 70% parameter reduction, with 50% faster training, 25% faster
inference, and only 2-3% accuracy loss. Layer-wise entanglement profiling
reveals redundancy in deeper layers, confirming their suitability for tensor
factorization. KARIPAP demonstrates that modern LLMs occupy low-dimensional
entanglement manifolds, enabling scalable, energy-efficient, and quantum-aware
AI architectures.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) test whether a data point was part of a
model's training set, posing serious privacy risks. Existing methods often
depend on shadow models or heavy query access, which limits their practicality.
We propose GP-MIA, an efficient and interpretable approach based on Gaussian

dataset statistics, and optional sensitivity features (e.g. gradients, NTK
measures) from a single trained model, GP-MIA trains a GP classifier to
distinguish members from non-members while providing calibrated uncertainty
estimates. Experiments on synthetic data, real-world fraud detection data,
CIFAR-10, and WikiText-2 show that GP-MIA achieves high accuracy and
generalizability, offering a practical alternative to existing MIAs.

TL;DR: 提出K-DAREK算法，通过增强KKAN架构实现高效、可解释的函数逼近和不确定性量化，在安全控制任务中展现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络架构选择影响可解释性、效率和泛化能力，高斯过程在大规模问题上计算昂贵，需要开发更高效且具有不确定性量化的模型。

Method: 通过增强KKAN架构，用Chebyshev层和多层感知机替换部分样条层，开发距离感知误差学习算法K-DAREK，建立反映测试点与训练点邻近度的鲁棒误差界。

Result: K-DAREK比KAN集成快4倍、计算效率高10倍，比GP可扩展性高8.6倍，比DAREK安全50%。

Conclusion: K-DAREK为动态系统中的算子估计和系统建模提供了高效、可解释且具有不确定性量化的强大架构。

Abstract: Neural networks are parametric and powerful tools for function approximation,
and the choice of architecture heavily influences their interpretability,
efficiency, and generalization. In contrast, Gaussian processes (GPs) are
nonparametric probabilistic models that define distributions over functions
using a kernel to capture correlations among data points. However, these models
become computationally expensive for large-scale problems, as they require
inverting a large covariance matrix. Kolmogorov- Arnold networks (KANs),
semi-parametric neural architectures, have emerged as a prominent approach for
modeling complex functions with structured and efficient representations
through spline layers. Kurkova Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KKANs) extend this
idea by reducing the number of spline layers in KAN and replacing them with
Chebyshev layers and multi-layer perceptrons, thereby mapping inputs into
higher-dimensional spaces before applying spline-based transformations.
Compared to KANs, KKANs perform more stable convergence during training, making
them a strong architecture for estimating operators and system modeling in
dynamical systems. By enhancing the KKAN architecture, we develop a novel
learning algorithm, distance-aware error for Kurkova-Kolmogorov networks
(K-DAREK), for efficient and interpretable function approximation with
uncertainty quantification. Our approach establishes robust error bounds that
are distance-aware; this means they reflect the proximity of a test point to
its nearest training points. Through case studies on a safe control task, we
demonstrate that K-DAREK is about four times faster and ten times higher
computationally efficiency than Ensemble of KANs, 8.6 times more scalable than
GP by increasing the data size, and 50% safer than our previous work
distance-aware error for Kolmogorov networks (DAREK).

Motivation: 电子健康记录数据为优化风险评分工具提供了机会，但面临部分监督（干预审查结果）和不对称误分类成本两个挑战。

Method: 使用混合整数规划框架联合优化评分权重和类别阈值，通过每实例可行标签集处理部分监督，结合不对称距离感知目标，并通过最小阈值间隙防止中间类别崩溃。

Result: 开发了CSO松弛方法，使用softplus损失保持序数结构，同时实现高效优化。

Conclusion: 该框架支持治理约束，包括符号限制、稀疏性和对现有工具的最小修改，确保在临床工作流程中的实际可部署性。

Abstract: Risk assessment tools in healthcare commonly employ point-based scoring
systems that map patients to ordinal risk categories via thresholds. While
electronic health record (EHR) data presents opportunities for data-driven
optimization of these tools, two fundamental challenges impede standard
supervised learning: (1) partial supervision arising from intervention-censored
outcomes, where only extreme categories can be reliably labeled, and (2)
asymmetric misclassification costs that increase with ordinal distance. We
propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework that jointly optimizes
scoring weights and category thresholds under these constraints. Our approach
handles partial supervision through per-instance feasible label sets,
incorporates asymmetric distance-aware objectives, and prevents middle-category
collapse via minimum threshold gaps. We further develop a CSO relaxation using
softplus losses that preserves the ordinal structure while enabling efficient
optimization. The framework supports governance constraints including sign
restrictions, sparsity, and minimal modifications to incumbent tools, ensuring
practical deployability in clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次将偏好优化引入降水临近预报，提出SynCast方法，通过两阶段后训练框架解决确定性模型预测过度平滑和概率模型性能波动的问题，协同优化冲突的CSI和FAR指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水临近预报面临确定性模型预测过度平滑难以捕捉极端事件，概率模型性能波动且难以在冲突指标上同时取得最优表现的问题。受大语言模型中人机反馈强化学习启发，引入偏好优化来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出SynCast方法，采用Diffusion-SPO两阶段后训练框架：第一阶段专注于降低FAR，训练模型有效抑制误报；第二阶段在保持FAR对齐约束下进一步优化CSI，实现冲突指标的协同改进。

Result: 该方法能够渐进对齐冲突指标，在降水临近预报中持续实现优越性能，有效解决了CSI和FAR之间的权衡问题。

Conclusion: 偏好优化在降水临近预报中具有重要应用价值，SynCast方法通过两阶段优化策略成功解决了现有模型在冲突指标上难以同时取得最优表现的问题。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting based on radar echoes plays a crucial role in
monitoring extreme weather and supporting disaster prevention. Although deep
learning approaches have achieved significant progress, they still face notable
limitations. For example, deterministic models tend to produce over-smoothed
predictions, which struggle to capture extreme events and fine-scale
precipitation patterns. Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent
randomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and
rarely achieve consistently optimal results. Furthermore, precipitation
nowcasting is typically evaluated using multiple metrics, some of which are
inherently conflicting. For instance, there is often a trade-off between the
Critical Success Index (CSI) and the False Alarm Ratio (FAR), making it
challenging for existing models to deliver forecasts that perform well on both
metrics simultaneously. To address these challenges, we introduce preference
optimization into precipitation nowcasting for the first time, motivated by the
success of reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models.
Specifically, we propose SynCast, a method that employs the two-stage
post-training framework of Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization
(Diffusion-SPO), to progressively align conflicting metrics and consistently
achieve superior performance. In the first stage, the framework focuses on
reducing FAR, training the model to effectively suppress false alarms. Building
on this foundation, the second stage further optimizes CSI with constraints
that preserve FAR alignment, thereby achieving synergistic improvements across
these conflicting metrics.

Motivation: 参数化图族中低通图滤波器的计算成本过高，需要重复求解特征值问题，因此需要更高效的算法。

Method: 基于Grassmann流形上法坐标的黎曼插值方法，推导子空间插值的误差界限。

Result: 提出了两种应用：通过相似性校正调整网络同质性程度的演化图拓扑，以及基于给定静态图的点积图族。

Conclusion: 该方法为参数化图族中的低通滤波器计算提供了高效解决方案，并展示了在演化图拓扑和节点分类中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Low-pass graph filters are fundamental for signal processing on graphs and
other non-Euclidean domains. However, the computation of such filters for
parametric graph families can be prohibitively expensive as computation of the
corresponding low-frequency subspaces, requires the repeated solution of an
eigenvalue problem. We suggest a novel algorithm of low-pass graph filter
interpolation based on Riemannian interpolation in normal coordinates on the
Grassmann manifold. We derive an error bound estimate for the subspace
interpolation and suggest two possible applications for induced parametric
graph families. First, we argue that the temporal evolution of the node
features may be translated to the evolving graph topology via a similarity
correction to adjust the homophily degree of the network. Second, we suggest a
dot product graph family induced by a given static graph which allows to infer
improved message passing scheme for node classification facilitated by the
filter interpolation.

Conclusion: AutoSciDACT为科学发现的严格统计需求提供了一个统一的新颖性检测流程，能够检测并统计量化科学数据中的异常。

Abstract: Novelty detection in large scientific datasets faces two key challenges: the
noisy and high-dimensional nature of experimental data, and the necessity of
making statistically robust statements about any observed outliers. While there
is a wealth of literature on anomaly detection via dimensionality reduction,
most methods do not produce outputs compatible with quantifiable claims of
scientific discovery. In this work we directly address these challenges,
presenting the first step towards a unified pipeline for novelty detection
adapted for the rigorous statistical demands of science. We introduce
AutoSciDACT (Automated Scientific Discovery with Anomalous Contrastive
Testing), a general-purpose pipeline for detecting novelty in scientific data.
AutoSciDACT begins by creating expressive low-dimensional data representations
using a contrastive pre-training, leveraging the abundance of high-quality
simulated data in many scientific domains alongside expertise that can guide
principled data augmentation strategies. These compact embeddings then enable
an extremely sensitive machine learning-based two-sample test using the New
Physics Learning Machine (NPLM) framework, which identifies and statistically
quantifies deviations in observed data relative to a reference distribution
(null hypothesis). We perform experiments across a range of astronomical,
physical, biological, image, and synthetic datasets, demonstrating strong
sensitivity to small injections of anomalous data across all domains.

Result: TowerVision在多个多模态多语言基准测试中取得竞争性表现，在ALM-Bench、Multi30K和ViMUL-Bench上超越基于更大数据集训练的方法。

Conclusion: 多语言视觉语言训练数据显著改善跨语言泛化能力，指令调优的LLM并非总是最佳初始化点。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), most existing
work follows an English-centric design process, limiting their effectiveness in
multilingual settings. In this work, we provide a comprehensive empirical study
analyzing the impact of several multilingual design choices, such as training
data composition, encoder selection, and text backbones. The result is
TowerVision, a family of open multilingual VLMs for both image-text and
video-text tasks, built upon the multilingual text-only model Tower+.
TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multiple multimodal
multilingual benchmarks and shows particular strength in culturally grounded
tasks and multimodal translation. By incorporating visual and cultural context
during fine-tuning, our models surpass existing approaches trained on
substantially larger datasets, as demonstrated on ALM-Bench and Multi30K (image
tasks) and ViMUL-Bench (video tasks). Alongside the models, we release
VisionBlocks, a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. Our findings
highlight that multilingual vision-language training data substantially
improves cross-lingual generalization -- both from high-resource to
underrepresented languages and vice versa -- and that instruction-tuned LLMs
are not always the optimal initialization point. To support further research,
we publicly release all models, data, and training recipes.

Abstract: Spectral decomposition of linear operators plays a central role in many areas
of machine learning and scientific computing. Recent work has explored training
neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions of such operators, enabling
scalable approaches to representation learning, dynamical systems, and partial
differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we revisit a classical
optimization framework from the computational physics literature known as the
\emph{orbital minimization method} (OMM), originally proposed in the 1990s for
solving eigenvalue problems in computational chemistry. We provide a simple
linear-algebraic proof of the consistency of the OMM objective, and reveal
connections between this method and several ideas that have appeared
independently across different domains. Our primary goal is to justify its
broader applicability in modern learning pipelines. We adapt this framework to
train neural networks to decompose positive semidefinite operators, and
demonstrate its practical advantages across a range of benchmark tasks. Our
results highlight how revisiting classical numerical methods through the lens
of modern theory and computation can provide not only a principled approach for
deploying neural networks in numerical simulation, but also effective and
scalable tools for machine learning.

Conclusion: DEIM不仅可作为模型降阶工具，还能作为诊断框架来理解和改进神经微分方程模型的泛化行为。

Abstract: We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical
Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical
system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in
projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points
limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this
limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the
one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to
dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and
physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis
tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The
DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics
of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow
configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a
model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and
improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.

Conclusion: DJGP通过结合局部线性投影和Jump Gaussian Processes，成功解决了高维分段连续函数的建模问题，提供了一种有效的深度高斯过程学习方法。

Abstract: We introduce Deep Jump Gaussian Processes (DJGP), a novel method for
surrogate modeling of high-dimensional piecewise continuous functions. DJGP
overcomes the limitations of conventional Jump Gaussian Processes in
high-dimensional input spaces by adding a locally linear projection layer to
Jump Gaussian Processes. This projection uses region-specific matrices to
capture local subspace structures, naturally complementing the localized nature
of JGP, a variant of local Gaussian Processes. To control model complexity, we
place a Gaussian Process prior on the projection matrices, allowing them to
evolve smoothly across the input space. The projected inputs are then modeled
with a JGP to capture piecewise continuous relationships with the response.
This yields a distinctive two-layer deep learning of GP/JGP. We further develop
a scalable variational inference algorithm to jointly learn the projection
matrices and JGP hyperparameters. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that DJGP delivers superior predictive accuracy and more
reliable uncertainty quantification compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Decision-making for multi-energy system (MES) dispatch depends on accurate
load forecasting. Traditionally, load forecasting and decision-making for MES
are implemented separately. Forecasting models are typically trained to
minimize forecasting errors, overlooking their impact on downstream
decision-making. To address this, decision-focused learning (DFL) has been
studied to minimize decision-making costs instead. However, practical adoption
of DFL in MES faces significant challenges: the process requires sharing
sensitive load data and model parameters across multiple sectors, raising
serious privacy issues. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving DFL
framework tailored for MES. Our approach introduces information masking to
safeguard private data while enabling recovery of decision variables and
gradients required for model training. To further enhance security for DFL, we
design a safety protocol combining matrix decomposition and homomorphic
encryption, effectively preventing collusion and unauthorized data access.
Additionally, we developed a privacy-preserving load pattern recognition
algorithm, enabling the training of specialized DFL models for heterogeneous
load patterns. Theoretical analysis and comprehensive case studies, including
real-world MES data, demonstrate that our framework not only protects privacy
but also consistently achieves lower average daily dispatch costs compared to
existing methods.

Abstract: Machine-learning methods in biochemistry commonly represent molecules as
graphs of pairwise intermolecular interactions for property and structure
predictions. Most methods operate on a single graph, typically the minimal free
energy (MFE) structure, for low-energy ensembles (conformations) representative
of structures at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce a thermodynamically
parameterized exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding that models
molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs. We evaluate
this embedding on SELEX datasets, where experimental biases (e.g., PCR
amplification or sequencing noise) can obscure true aptamer-ligand affinity,
producing anomalous candidates whose observed abundance diverges from their
actual binding strength. We show that the proposed embedding enables robust
community detection and subgraph-level explanations for aptamer ligand
affinity, even in the presence of biased observations. This approach may be
used to identify low-abundance aptamer candidates for further experimental
evaluation.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of deep learning, applying such techniques to EM
methods has emerged as a promising research direction to overcome the
limitations of conventional approaches. The effectiveness of deep learning
methods depends heavily on the quality of datasets, which directly influences
model performance and generalization ability. Existing application studies
often construct datasets from random one-dimensional or structurally simple
three-dimensional models, which fail to represent the complexity of real
geological environments. Furthermore, the absence of standardized, publicly
available three-dimensional geoelectric datasets continues to hinder progress
in deep learning based EM exploration. To address these limitations, we present
OpenEM, a large scale, multi structural three dimensional geoelectric dataset
that encompasses a broad range of geologically plausible subsurface structures.
OpenEM consists of nine categories of geoelectric models, spanning from simple
configurations with anomalous bodies in half space to more complex structures
such as flat layers, folded layers, flat faults, curved faults, and their
corresponding variants with anomalous bodies. Since three-dimensional forward
modeling in electromagnetics is extremely time-consuming, we further developed
a deep learning based fast forward modeling approach for OpenEM, enabling
efficient and reliable forward modeling across the entire dataset. This
capability allows OpenEM to be rapidly deployed for a wide range of tasks.
OpenEM provides a unified, comprehensive, and large-scale dataset for common EM
exploration systems to accelerate the application of deep learning in
electromagnetic methods. The complete dataset, along with the forward modeling
codes and trained models, is publicly available at

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to solve long-horizon tasks even when
training data contains only short fragments of the behaviors. This experience
stitching capability is often viewed as the purview of temporal difference (TD)
methods. However, outside of small tabular settings, trajectories never
intersect, calling into question this conventional wisdom. Moreover, the common
belief is that Monte Carlo (MC) methods should not be able to recombine
experience, yet it remains unclear whether function approximation could result
in a form of implicit stitching. The goal of this paper is to empirically study
whether the conventional wisdom about stitching actually holds in settings
where function approximation is used. We empirically demonstrate that Monte
Carlo (MC) methods can also achieve experience stitching. While TD methods do
achieve slightly stronger capabilities than MC methods (in line with
conventional wisdom), that gap is significantly smaller than the gap between
small and large neural networks (even on quite simple tasks). We find that
increasing critic capacity effectively reduces the generalization gap for both
the MC and TD methods. These results suggest that the traditional TD inductive
bias for stitching may be less necessary in the era of large models for RL and,
in some cases, may offer diminishing returns. Additionally, our results suggest
that stitching, a form of generalization unique to the RL setting, might be
achieved not through specialized algorithms (temporal difference learning) but
rather through the same recipe that has provided generalization in other
machine learning settings (via scale). Project website:

### [55] [The Mirror Loop: Recursive Non-Convergence in Generative Reasoning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21861)
*Bentley DeVilling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在没有外部反馈的递归自我评估中会出现信息闭合现象，而最小程度的验证干预能显著恢复信息流动，这表明自回归训练存在结构性的自我修正限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试大语言模型在无外部反馈的递归自我评估中是否真的能够进行反思性推理，还是仅仅产生重新表述而非实质性进展。

Method: 跨提供商研究，使用三个模型（GPT-4o-mini、Claude 3 Haiku、Gemini 2.0 Flash）和四类任务（算术、代码、解释、反思），每种任务迭代十次，比较无基础自我批判和最小基础干预（第三次迭代时进行单次验证）两种条件。

Result: 无基础运行中，平均信息变化从早期到后期下降55%；基础运行在干预后立即出现28%的信息变化反弹，并保持非零方差；多种测量指标一致显示无接触反思趋向信息闭合。

Conclusion: 生成推理中的自我修正存在结构性限制，没有独立验证者或环境的信息交换，递归推理会趋向认知静止状态；最小基础干预作为耗散耦合重新引入信息流；跨架构一致性表明镜像循环源于共享的自回归训练目标。

Abstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning,
yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields
reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider
study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini,
Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families
(arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two
conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a
single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta
I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to
late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all
three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change
immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter.
Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level
entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward
informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on
self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information
with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an
attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative
coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency
suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives
rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when
reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles
for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了因果可解释性概念，分析了两类常见模型在反事实查询方面的局限性，并开发了一个框架来构建具有因果可解释性的模型，揭示了因果可解释性与预测准确性之间的权衡关系。

Motivation: 理解深度学习模型的预测仍然是一个核心挑战，特别是在高风险应用中。需要让模型能够回答反事实问题，即超越观测数据的假设性"如果...会怎样"场景，以提供对模型推理的洞察。

Method: 引入因果可解释性概念，分析黑盒和基于概念的预测器的局限性；开发构建因果可解释模型的框架，推导出确定模型架构是否支持特定反事实查询的完整图形准则；识别出在保持最大预测表达能力的同时实现可解释性的独特最大特征集。

Result: 理论分析表明黑盒和基于概念的预测器通常不具有因果可解释性；提出的框架能够构建具有因果可解释性的模型；实验证实了理论发现。

Conclusion: 存在因果可解释性与预测准确性之间的基本权衡关系，通过识别适当的特征集可以实现具有最大预测表达能力的可解释模型。

Abstract: Understanding the predictions made by deep learning models remains a central
challenge, especially in high-stakes applications. A promising approach is to
equip models with the ability to answer counterfactual questions --
hypothetical ``what if?'' scenarios that go beyond the observed data and
provide insight into a model reasoning. In this work, we introduce the notion
of causal interpretability, which formalizes when counterfactual queries can be
evaluated from a specific class of models and observational data. We analyze
two common model classes -- blackbox and concept-based predictors -- and show
that neither is causally interpretable in general. To address this gap, we
develop a framework for building models that are causally interpretable by
design. Specifically, we derive a complete graphical criterion that determines
whether a given model architecture supports a given counterfactual query. This
leads to a fundamental tradeoff between causal interpretability and predictive
accuracy, which we characterize by identifying the unique maximal set of
features that yields an interpretable model with maximal predictive
expressiveness. Experiments corroborate the theoretical findings.

Result: 揭示了三种视角共享的共同骨架：时间依赖的速度场，其流将简单先验传输到数据。采样相当于求解将噪声演化为数据的微分方程。

Conclusion: 扩散模型提供了一个统一的框架，通过连续轨迹将噪声转换为数据，为可控生成、高效求解等应用奠定了数学基础。

Abstract: This monograph presents the core principles that have guided the development
of diffusion models, tracing their origins and showing how diverse formulations
arise from shared mathematical ideas. Diffusion modeling starts by defining a
forward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data
distribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate
distributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise
back into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three
complementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational
autoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The
score-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the
evolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely
regions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation
as following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a
learned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a
time-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.
Sampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise
into data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph
discusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,
and diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between
arbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded
understanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning
knowledge.

Motivation: 现有文本水印方法假设完美伪随机性，但实际中生成文本的重复会导致结构化依赖，破坏I类错误控制并使标准分析失效。

Method: 引入分层两层分区的统计框架，定义最小单元概念，将水印检测建模为极小极大假设检验问题，应用于Gumbel-max和逆变换水印。

Conclusion: 该框架为不完美伪随机性下的水印检测提供了首个原则性基础，为模型输出的可靠追踪提供了理论洞见和实践指导。

Abstract: Text watermarking plays a crucial role in ensuring the traceability and
accountability of large language model (LLM) outputs and mitigating misuse.
While promising, most existing methods assume perfect pseudorandomness. In
practice, repetition in generated text induces collisions that create
structured dependence, compromising Type I error control and invalidating
standard analyses.
  We introduce a statistical framework that captures this structure through a
hierarchical two-layer partition. At its core is the concept of minimal units
-- the smallest groups treatable as independent across units while permitting
dependence within. Using minimal units, we define a non-asymptotic efficiency
measure and cast watermark detection as a minimax hypothesis testing problem.
  Applied to Gumbel-max and inverse-transform watermarks, our framework
produces closed-form optimal rules. It explains why discarding repeated
statistics often improves performance and shows that within-unit dependence
must be addressed unless degenerate. Both theory and experiments confirm
improved detection power with rigorous Type I error control. These results
provide the first principled foundation for watermark detection under imperfect
pseudorandomness, offering both theoretical insight and practical guidance for
reliable tracing of model outputs.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms
generally depends on data representation. That is why, much of the current
effort in performing machine learning algorithms goes into the design of
preprocessing frameworks and data transformations able to support effective
machine learning. The method proposed in this work consists of a hybrid linear
feature extraction scheme to be used in supervised multi-class classification
problems. Inspired by two recent linear discriminant methods: robust sparse
linear discriminant analysis (RSLDA) and inter-class sparsitybased
discriminative least square regression (ICS_DLSR), we propose a unifying
criterion that is able to retain the advantages of these two powerful methods.
The resulting transformation relies on sparsity-promoting techniques both to
select the features that most accurately represent the data and to preserve the
row-sparsity consistency property of samples from the same class. The linear
transformation and the orthogonal matrix are estimated using an iterative
alternating minimization scheme based on steepest descent gradient method and
different initialization schemes. The proposed framework is generic in the
sense that it allows the combination and tuning of other linear discriminant
embedding methods. According to the experiments conducted on several datasets
including faces, objects, and digits, the proposed method was able to
outperform competing methods in most cases.

TL;DR: 提出加权准确率(WA)作为二元分类器的评估指标，该指标与最小化总分类成本(TCC)一致，并澄清了在成本敏感场景中处理类别不平衡的概念框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类器评估缺乏统一标准，且存在对数据集平衡的误解。由于分类器优化的最终目标通常是最大化投资回报或最小化总分类成本(TCC)，需要开发与TCC最小化一致的评估指标。

Method: 定义加权准确率(WA)作为二元分类器的评估指标，该指标是标准准确率的加权版本。提出处理类别不平衡的概念框架，提供重新平衡技术的替代方案，并开发在缺乏完全指定UCCs时估计WA权重参数的程序。

Result: WA与TCC在示例依赖场景中具有强相关性，证明了该指标的鲁棒性。该框架允许在不同数据集间比较结果，并解决开发数据集与目标数据集之间的差异。

Conclusion: WA是一个与TCC最小化一致的实用评估指标，澄清了在成本敏感分类中何时使用重新平衡技术是合适的，何时是适得其反的。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate evaluation metric for classifiers is crucial for
model comparison and parameter optimization, yet there is not consensus on a
universally accepted metric that serves as a definitive standard. Moreover,
there is often a misconception about the perceived need to mitigate imbalance
in datasets used to train classification models. Since the final goal in
classifier optimization is typically maximizing the return of investment or,
equivalently, minimizing the Total Classification Cost (TCC), we define
Weighted Accuracy (WA), an evaluation metric for binary classifiers with a
straightforward interpretation as a weighted version of the well-known accuracy
metric, coherent with the need of minimizing TCC. We clarify the conceptual
framework for handling class imbalance in cost-sensitive scenarios, providing
an alternative to rebalancing techniques. This framework can be applied to any
metric that, like WA, can be expressed as a linear combination of
example-dependent quantities and allows for comparing the results obtained in
different datasets and for addressing discrepancies between the development
dataset, used to train and validate the model, and the target dataset, where
the model will be deployed. It also specifies in which scenarios using
UCCs-unaware class rebalancing techniques or rebalancing metrics aligns with
TCC minimization and when it is instead counterproductive. Finally, we propose
a procedure to estimate the WA weight parameter in the absence of fully
specified UCCs and demonstrate the robustness of WA by analyzing its
correlation with TCC in example-dependent scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性训练方法难以防御新出现的越狱攻击，因为传统方法面临优化挑战和威胁模型定义困难。论文假设新型越狱攻击本质上是先前对抗性技能的重组而非全新攻击。

Method: 通过大规模分析32个攻击论文，提取并压缩对抗性技能为稀疏字典基元，使用LLM生成可读描述，然后提出对抗性技能组合训练(ASCoT)，训练模型识别技能组合而非孤立攻击实例。

Result: ASCoT显著提高了对未见攻击的鲁棒性，包括多轮越狱攻击，同时保持较低的过度拒绝率。研究表明扩展对抗性技能覆盖范围而非仅增加数据规模是防御新攻击的关键。

Conclusion: 对抗性技能组合训练通过将对抗性技能视为可组合基元的新范式，为防御新型越狱攻击提供了有效解决方案，验证了对抗性既视感假设的正确性。

Abstract: Large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
safety guardrails to elicit harmful outputs. Defending against novel jailbreaks
represents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed
to make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant
paradigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges
and difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training
methods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper
proposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,
centered on the Adversarial D\'ej\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not
fundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from
previous attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32
attack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract
and compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with
LLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen
attacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,
with explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided
by this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),
which trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated
attack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,
including multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates. We
also demonstrate that expanding adversarial skill coverage, not just data
scale, is key to defending against novel attacks.

Abstract: We study the problem of Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL), where the
goal is to learn a reward-maximizing policy from fixed data under a cumulative
cost constraint. We propose a novel OSRL approach that frames the problem as a
minimax objective and solves it by combining offline RL with online
optimization algorithms. We prove the approximate optimality of this approach
when integrated with an approximate offline RL oracle and no-regret online
optimization. We also present a practical approximation that can be combined
with any offline RL algorithm, eliminating the need for offline policy
evaluation. Empirical results on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that our method
reliably enforces safety constraints under stringent cost budgets, while
achieving high rewards. The code is available at

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is a fundamental task in artificial
intelligence, with far-reaching implications for decision-making, predictions,
and interventions. Despite significant advances, existing methods can be
broadly categorized as constraint-based or score-based approaches.
Constraint-based methods offer rigorous causal discovery but are often hindered
by small sample sizes, while score-based methods provide flexible optimization
but typically forgo explicit conditional independence testing. This work
explores a third avenue: developing differentiable $d$-separation scores,
obtained through a percolation theory using soft logic. This enables the
implementation of a new type of causal discovery method: gradient-based
optimization of conditional independence constraints. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate the robust performance of our approach in low-sample regimes,
surpassing traditional constraint-based and score-based baselines on a
real-world dataset. Code and data of the proposed method are publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究发现神经网络存在瓶颈秩特性：随着深度增加，基于梯度方法训练的神经网络激活和权重趋于近似低秩。本文旨在探讨这一现象对泛化能力的影响。

Method: 通过分析权重矩阵的Schatten p拟范数，构建泛化边界理论框架。当p较小时，边界表现出与权重矩阵秩相关的样本复杂度特性。

Result: 证明了基于Schatten p拟范数的泛化边界：对于小的p，样本复杂度为O(WrL²)，其中W、L分别为网络宽度和深度，r为权重矩阵秩；随着p增大，边界行为更接近基于范数的边界。

Conclusion: 神经网络的瓶颈秩特性可被用于推导更紧致的泛化边界，这为理解深度网络泛化能力提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: It has been recently observed in much of the literature that neural networks
exhibit a bottleneck rank property: for larger depths, the activation and
weights of neural networks trained with gradient-based methods tend to be of
approximately low rank. In fact, the rank of the activations of each layer
converges to a fixed value referred to as the ``bottleneck rank'', which is the
minimum rank required to represent the training data. This perspective is in
line with the observation that regularizing linear networks (without
activations) with weight decay is equivalent to minimizing the Schatten $p$
quasi norm of the neural network. In this paper we investigate the implications
of this phenomenon for generalization. More specifically, we prove
generalization bounds for neural networks which exploit the approximate low
rank structure of the weight matrices if present. The final results rely on the
Schatten $p$ quasi norms of the weight matrices: for small $p$, the bounds
exhibit a sample complexity $ \widetilde{O}(WrL^2)$ where $W$ and $L$ are the
width and depth of the neural network respectively and where $r$ is the rank of
the weight matrices. As $p$ increases, the bound behaves more like a norm-based
bound instead.

Method: 采用线性最优传输框架，将不规则点云嵌入固定维度的欧几里得空间，保持分布结构并形成患者间的配准。

Conclusion: LOT建立了连接预测性能、可解释性和生成建模的统一框架，为理解高维生物系统中的免疫变异和治疗效果开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells,
enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment
responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather
than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare
biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels
and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes,
offering little biological interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT)
framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a
fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure.
This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves
optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a
registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their
cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \textbf{accurate
and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier
weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions;
and (ii) \textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids,
exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged
cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug
interaction testing.
  Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges
predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By
transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly
traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding
immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.

Abstract: The classic Mallows model is a foundational tool for modeling user
preferences. However, it has limitations in capturing real-world scenarios,
where users often focus only on a limited set of preferred items and are
indifferent to the rest. To address this, extensions such as the top-k Mallows
model have been proposed, aligning better with practical applications. In this
paper, we address several challenges related to the generalized top-k Mallows
model, with a focus on analyzing buyer choices. Our key contributions are: (1)
a novel sampling scheme tailored to generalized top-k Mallows models, (2) an
efficient algorithm for computing choice probabilities under this model, and
(3) an active learning algorithm for estimating the model parameters from
observed choice data. These contributions provide new tools for analysis and
prediction in critical decision-making scenarios. We present a rigorous
mathematical analysis for the performance of our algorithms. Furthermore,
through extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world data, we
demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our proposed methods, and we
compare the predictive power of Mallows model for top-k lists compared to the
simpler Multinomial Logit model.

Abstract: The original softmax-based attention mechanism (regular attention) in the
extremely successful Transformer architecture computes attention between $N$
tokens, each embedded in a $D$-dimensional head, with a time complexity of
$O(N^2D)$. Given the success of Transformers, improving their runtime during
both training and inference is a popular research area. One such approach is
the introduction of the linear attention (LA) mechanisms, which offers a linear
time complexity of $O(ND^2)$ and have demonstrated comparable accuracy to
regular attention. However, LA in practice lags behind its theoretical
efficiency. We propose a novel method for LA's forward and backward passes,
along with a highly-optimized CUDA implementation. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by 3.3 times in speed and reduces memory consumption by 3.6
times. We validate these improvements in both single-layer and end-to-end
settings by training a 1.4 billion parameter language model, which demonstrates
similar expressivity to regular attention on major reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Sampling from constrained statistical distributions is a fundamental task in
various fields including Bayesian statistics, computational chemistry, and
statistical physics. This article considers the cases where the constrained
distribution is described by an unconstrained density, as well as additional
equality and/or inequality constraints, which often make the constraint set
nonconvex. Existing methods for nonconvex constraint set $\Sigma \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ defined by equality or inequality constraints commonly rely on
costly projection steps. Moreover, they cannot handle equality and inequality
constraints simultaneously as each method only specialized in one case. In
addition, rigorous and quantitative convergence guarantee is often lacking. In
this paper, we introduce Overdamped Langevin with LAnding (OLLA), a new
framework that can design overdamped Langevin dynamics accommodating both
equality and inequality constraints. The proposed dynamics also
deterministically corrects trajectories along the normal direction of the
constraint surface, thus obviating the need for explicit projections. We show
that, under suitable regularity conditions on the target density and $\Sigma$,
OLLA converges exponentially fast in $W_2$ distance to the constrained target
density $\rho_\Sigma(x) \propto \exp(-f(x))d\sigma_\Sigma$. Lastly, through
experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of OLLA compared to projection-based
constrained Langevin algorithms and their slack variable variants, highlighting
its favorable computational cost and reasonable empirical mixing.

TL;DR: PUNT是一种模型无关的采样器，通过识别token依赖关系并移除低置信度token来解决掩码扩散模型中并行采样的条件独立性与高置信度预测之间的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型支持并行token采样，比自回归模型推理更快，但并行采样面临条件独立性和高置信度预测之间的冲突。

Method: 通过近似条件独立性测试识别token依赖关系，移除冲突组中的低置信度token，生成满足独立性和置信度标准的索引集进行并行解掩码。

Result: 在IFEval基准测试中，PUNT比基线方法（包括顺序生成）准确率提高高达16%，尤其在生成长序列时表现更优，且对超参数不敏感。

Conclusion: PUNT在准确性和计算效率之间实现了优越的权衡，并诱导出层次化生成策略，表现出类似规划的生成过程，有助于强对齐性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive models (ARMs) for discrete text generation because they enable
parallel token sampling, rather than sequential, left-to-right generation. This
means potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling
faces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be
conditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence
predictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often
cluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates.
  We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our
method identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from
conflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy
both independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved
parallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing.
  Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy
and compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially
for generation of longer sequences. On the IFEval benchmark, it achieves up to
16\% higher accuracy over baseline methods, including sequential generation
(one-by-one). These gains hold across different values of hyperparameters,
mitigating the need for brittle hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, we observe
that PUNT induces an emergent hierarchical generation strategy, where the model
first establishes high-level paragraph structure before local refinement,
suggesting a planning-like generation process that contributes to strong
alignment performance.

Motivation: 现有方法如函数线性模型和神经算子要么无法捕捉复杂非线性关系，要么在噪声、稀疏和不规则采样数据下缺乏可靠的不确定性量化。

Method: 设计了一系列基于高斯过程的线性和非线性变换，利用核的积分变换、GP插值和从GP采样的非线性激活函数，通过固定位置简化实现，并使用诱导点和白化变换进行变分学习。

Result: 在真实世界和PDE基准数据集上的实验结果表明，DGPFM在预测性能和不确定性校准方面具有优势。

Conclusion: DGPFM方法成功解决了函数空间映射学习中的非线性建模和不确定性量化问题，为函数数据分析提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: Learning mappings between functional spaces, also known as
function-on-function regression, plays a crucial role in functional data
analysis and has broad applications, e.g. spatiotemporal forecasting, curve
prediction, and climate modeling. Existing approaches, such as functional
linear models and neural operators, either fall short of capturing complex
nonlinearities or lack reliable uncertainty quantification under noisy, sparse,
and irregularly sampled data. To address these issues, we propose Deep Gaussian
Processes for Functional Maps (DGPFM). Our method designs a sequence of
GP-based linear and nonlinear transformations, leveraging integral transforms
of kernels, GP interpolation, and nonlinear activations sampled from GPs. A key
insight simplifies implementation: under fixed locations, discrete
approximations of kernel integral transforms collapse into direct functional
integral transforms, enabling flexible incorporation of various integral
transform designs. To achieve scalable probabilistic inference, we use inducing
points and whitening transformations to develop a variational learning
algorithm. Empirical results on real-world and PDE benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the advantage of DGPFM in both predictive performance and
uncertainty calibration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RMAB假设二元动作和单一全局预算，但现实场景（如医疗保健）涉及多种干预措施和异构约束，需要更通用的框架。

Method: 使用神经网络学习臂-动作对的索引，通过熵正则化最优传输问题构建可微背包层，将索引预测和约束优化统一在端到端可微框架中。

Result: NIP在异构预算约束下实现了接近最优的性能（与oracle策略相差5%以内），并能扩展到数百个臂。

Conclusion: 为复杂资源受限环境中的索引策略学习建立了一个通用、理论基础坚实且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) provide a scalable framework for
sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical formulations assume
binary actions and a single global budget. Real-world settings, such as
healthcare, often involve multiple interventions with heterogeneous costs and
constraints, where such assumptions break down. We introduce a Neural Index
Policy (NIP) for multi-action RMABs with heterogeneous budget constraints. Our
approach learns to assign budget-aware indices to arm--action pairs using a
neural network, and converts them into feasible allocations via a
differentiable knapsack layer formulated as an entropy-regularized optimal
transport (OT) problem. The resulting model unifies index prediction and
constrained optimization in a single end-to-end differentiable framework,
enabling gradient-based training directly on decision quality. The network is
optimized to align its induced occupancy measure with the theoretical upper
bound from a linear programming relaxation, bridging asymptotic RMAB theory
with practical learning. Empirically, NIP achieves near-optimal performance
within 5% of the oracle occupancy-measure policy while strictly enforcing
heterogeneous budgets and scaling to hundreds of arms. This work establishes a
general, theoretically grounded, and scalable framework for learning
index-based policies in complex resource-constrained environments.

<details>

Motivation: RLVR训练虽然提升了数学和多模态推理能力，但会导致模型基础能力（如感知和忠实度）的退化，现有正则化方法无法保证广泛知识的保留

Method: 提出RECAP方法，使用动态目标重加权机制，基于收敛和不稳定性信号在线调整训练重点，从饱和目标转向表现不佳或波动的目标

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B和Qwen2.5-VL-7B上的实验表明，该方法有效保护通用能力，同时通过更灵活的任务奖励权衡提升推理能力

Conclusion: RECAP是一种端到端的重放策略，无需额外模型训练或大量调参即可应用于现有RLVR流程，有效解决能力退化问题

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has delivered
impressive gains in mathematical and multimodal reasoning and has become a
standard post-training paradigm for contemporary language and vision-language
models. However, the RLVR recipe introduces a significant risk of capability
regression, where models forget foundational skills after prolonged training
without employing regularization strategies. We empirically confirm this
concern, observing that open-source reasoning models suffer performance
degradation on core capabilities such as perception and faithfulness. While
imposing regularization terms like KL divergence can help prevent deviation
from the base model, these terms are calculated on the current task, thus they
do not guarantee broader knowledge. Meanwhile, commonly used experience replay
across heterogeneous domains makes it nontrivial to decide how much training
focus each objective should receive. To address this, we propose RECAP-a replay
strategy with dynamic objective reweighting for general knowledge preservation.
Our reweighting mechanism adapts in an online manner using short-horizon
signals of convergence and instability, shifting the post-training focus away
from saturated objectives and toward underperforming or volatile ones. Our
method is end-to-end and readily applicable to existing RLVR pipelines without
training additional models or heavy tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmarks
based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, which not only preserves general capabilities but also improves
reasoning by enabling more flexible trade-offs among in-task rewards.

Abstract: Generative modeling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation
learning, but its direct applicability to challenging fields like medical
imaging remains limited: mere generation, without task alignment, fails to
provide a robust foundation for clinical use. We propose MAGIC-Flow, a
conditional multiscale normalizing flow architecture that performs generation
and classification within a single modular framework. The model is built as a
hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections, where the Jacobian
determinant factorizes across sub-transformations. We show how this ensures
exact likelihood computation and stable optimization, while invertibility
enables explicit visualization of sample likelihoods, providing an
interpretable lens into the model's reasoning. By conditioning on class labels,
MAGIC-Flow supports controllable sample synthesis and principled
class-probability estimation, effectively aiding both generative and
discriminative objectives. We evaluate MAGIC-Flow against top baselines using
metrics for similarity, fidelity, and diversity. Across multiple datasets, it
addresses generation and classification under scanner noise, and
modality-specific synthesis and identification. Results show MAGIC-Flow creates
realistic, diverse samples and improves classification. MAGIC-Flow is an
effective strategy for generation and classification in data-limited domains,
with direct benefits for privacy-preserving augmentation, robust
generalization, and trustworthy medical AI.

Conclusion: AniDS框架通过各向异性噪声建模显著提升了分子去噪预训练的性能，更好地反映了分子系统的方向性和结构变异性。

Abstract: Coordinate denoising has emerged as a promising method for 3D molecular
pretraining due to its theoretical connection to learning molecular force
field. However, existing denoising methods rely on oversimplied molecular
dynamics that assume atomic motions to be isotropic and homoscedastic. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel denoising framework AniDS:
Anisotropic Variational Autoencoder for 3D Molecular Denoising. AniDS
introduces a structure-aware anisotropic noise generator that can produce
atom-specific, full covariance matrices for Gaussian noise distributions to
better reflect directional and structural variability in molecular systems.
These covariances are derived from pairwise atomic interactions as anisotropic
corrections to an isotropic base. Our design ensures that the resulting
covariance matrices are symmetric, positive semi-definite, and
SO(3)-equivariant, while providing greater capacity to model complex molecular
dynamics. Extensive experiments show that AniDS outperforms prior isotropic and
homoscedastic denoising models and other leading methods on the MD17 and OC22
benchmarks, achieving average relative improvements of 8.9% and 6.2% in force
prediction accuracy. Our case study on a crystal and molecule structure shows
that AniDS adaptively suppresses noise along the bonding direction, consistent
with physicochemical principles. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文研究节点监控系统中查询成本与预测准确性之间的权衡问题，提出贪婪策略及其学习变体来优化查询决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在节点状态监控中，每次状态查询都有固定成本，而预测方法存在不确定性。需要设计智能的查询策略来平衡查询成本和预测准确性。

Method: 采用贪婪策略：当预期预测损失低于查询成本时进行预测，否则查询。对于未知转移概率的情况，提出基于投影随机梯度下降的学习变体。

Result: 贪婪策略在一般情况下可能是次优的且竞争比无界，但在常见条件下（如相同分布的转移概率）接近最优。学习变体在计算效率上优于最优策略。

Conclusion: 贪婪策略及其学习变体在节点监控系统中提供了有效的查询-预测权衡解决方案，特别适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: We consider a node-monitor pair, where the node's state varies with time. The
monitor needs to track the node's state at all times; however, there is a fixed
cost for each state query. So the monitor may instead predict the state using
time-series forecasting methods, including time-series foundation models
(TSFMs), and query only when prediction uncertainty is high. Since query
decisions influence prediction accuracy, determining when to query is
nontrivial. A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the
expected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We
analyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is
a state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query
cost and prediction losses. We show that, in general, the greedy policy is
suboptimal and can have an unbounded competitive ratio, but under common
conditions such as identically distributed transition probabilities, it
performs close to OPT. For the case of unknown transition probabilities, we
further propose a projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based learning
variant of the greedy policy, which achieves a favorable predict-query tradeoff
with improved computational efficiency compared to OPT.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型可解释性研究主要依赖代理模块进行特征发现，但缺乏对这些学习特征与原始模型参数特征的系统性比较。

Method: 重新评估前馈层作为键值记忆存储的特征向量，使用现代可解释性基准进行广泛评估。

Result: SAE和FF在可解释性范围上相似，SAE在某些方面有微小改进，但在某些方面FF甚至比SAE表现更好，且两者发现的特征存在分歧。

Conclusion: SAE在特征质量和忠实性方面的优势受到质疑，FF键值参数应作为现代可解释性研究的强基线。

Abstract: Recent interpretability work on large language models (LLMs) has been
increasingly dominated by a feature-discovery approach with the help of proxy
modules. Then, the quality of features learned by, e.g., sparse auto-encoders
(SAEs), is evaluated. This paradigm naturally raises a critical question: do
such learned features have better properties than those already represented
within the original model parameters, and unfortunately, only a few studies
have made such comparisons systematically so far. In this work, we revisit the
interpretability of feature vectors stored in feed-forward (FF) layers, given
the perspective of FF as key-value memories, with modern interpretability
benchmarks. Our extensive evaluation revealed that SAE and FFs exhibits a
similar range of interpretability, although SAEs displayed an observable but
minimal improvement in some aspects. Furthermore, in certain aspects,
surprisingly, even vanilla FFs yielded better interpretability than the SAEs,
and features discovered in SAEs and FFs diverged. These bring questions about
the advantage of SAEs from both perspectives of feature quality and
faithfulness, compared to directly interpreting FF feature vectors, and FF
key-value parameters serve as a strong baseline in modern interpretability
research.

Conclusion: 提出的四步部分贝叶斯框架有效解决了本构模型发现中的不确定性量化问题，无需先验选择且支持非线性模型发现。

Abstract: Constitutive model discovery refers to the task of identifying an appropriate
model structure, usually from a predefined model library, while simultaneously
inferring its material parameters. The data used for model discovery are
measured in mechanical tests and are thus inevitably affected by noise which,
in turn, induces uncertainties. Previously proposed methods for uncertainty
quantification in model discovery either require the selection of a prior for
the material parameters, are restricted to the linear coefficients of the model
library or are limited in the flexibility of the inferred parameter probability
distribution. We therefore propose a four-step partially Bayesian framework for
uncertainty quantification in model discovery that does not require prior
selection for the material parameters and also allows for the discovery of
non-linear constitutive models: First, we augment the available
stress-deformation data with a Gaussian process. Second, we approximate the
parameter distribution by a normalizing flow, which allows for capturing
complex joint distributions. Third, we distill the parameter distribution by
matching the distribution of stress-deformation functions induced by the
parameters with the Gaussian process posterior. Fourth, we perform a Sobol'
sensitivity analysis to obtain a sparse and interpretable model. We demonstrate
the capability of our framework for both isotropic and anisotropic experimental
data as well as linear and non-linear model libraries.

this gap by providing AlphaFold2-derived embeddings for computational modeling.

Abstract: Low-precision streaming PCA estimates the top principal component in a
streaming setting under limited precision. We establish an
information-theoretic lower bound on the quantization resolution required to
achieve a target accuracy for the leading eigenvector. We study Oja's algorithm
for streaming PCA under linear and nonlinear stochastic quantization. The
quantized variants use unbiased stochastic quantization of the weight vector
and the updates. Under mild moment and spectral-gap assumptions on the data
distribution, we show that a batched version achieves the lower bound up to
logarithmic factors under both schemes. This leads to a nearly dimension-free
quantization error in the nonlinear quantization setting. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic streams validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our
low-precision methods closely track the performance of standard Oja's
algorithm.

TL;DR: 本文分析了连续扩散在离散数据上表现不佳的原因，提出了token可识别性框架来解释高斯噪声对离散数据的双重破坏机制，并提出了CANDI混合框架来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续扩散在连续域（如图像生成）表现出色，但在离散数据上表现不如纯离散方法。这种差距令人困惑，因为连续扩散学习到的评分函数能够实现多位置的联合演化。

Method: 提出了CANDI（连续和离散扩散）混合框架，将离散和连续破坏解耦，同时学习条件结构和连续几何。通过分析token可识别性，揭示了离散身份破坏和连续秩退化的双重机制。

Result: CANDI成功避免了时间失调现象，在受控生成中能够使用现成的分类器进行基于分类器的引导，在文本生成中在低NFE下优于掩码扩散。

Conclusion: CANDI解锁了连续扩散在离散空间中的优势，证明了学习连续梯度对离散空间的价值，为离散数据生成提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: While continuous diffusion has shown remarkable success in continuous domains
such as image generation, its direct application to discrete data has
underperformed compared to purely discrete formulations. This gap is
counterintuitive, given that continuous diffusion learns score functions that
enable joint evolution across multiple positions. To understand this gap, we
introduce token identifiability as an analytical framework for understanding
how Gaussian noise corrupts discrete data through two mechanisms: discrete
identity corruption and continuous rank degradation. We reveal that these
mechanisms scale differently with vocabulary size, creating a temporal
dissonance: at noise levels where discrete corruption preserves enough
structure for conditional learning, continuous denoising is trivial; at noise
levels where continuous denoising is meaningful, discrete corruption destroys
nearly all conditional structure. To solve this, we propose CANDI (Continuous
ANd DIscrete diffusion), a hybrid framework that decouples discrete and
continuous corruption, enabling simultaneous learning of both conditional
structure and continuous geometry. We empirically validate the temporal
dissonance phenomenon and demonstrate that CANDI successfully avoids it. This
unlocks the benefits of continuous diffusion for discrete spaces: on controlled
generation, CANDI enables classifier-based guidance with off-the-shelf
classifiers through simple gradient addition; on text generation, CANDI
outperforms masked diffusion at low NFE, demonstrating the value of learning
continuous gradients for discrete spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一个考虑制度信任的强化学习算法，用于社区资源分配，发现在组织目标不确定时，纳入信任能产生更成功的政策，但组织成功与社区福祉之间存在张力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL工作假设公民会遵循政策，但现实中缺乏制度信任时公民不会遵循政府政策，因此需要开发信任感知的算法来改善资源分配。

Method: 使用深度确定性策略梯度方法学习资源分配策略，模拟资源分配过程并建模社区成员制度信任的变化，研究信任纳入对结果的影响。

Result: 纳入信任的RL算法能产生更成功的政策，保守的信任估计能提高公平性和平均社区信任，但会降低组织成功率；配额系统干预能在某些情况下改善公平和信任。

Conclusion: 制度信任在算法设计和实施中至关重要，组织成功与社区福祉之间存在张力，需要平衡两者关系。

Abstract: Many governmental bodies are adopting AI policies for decision-making. In
particular, Reinforcement Learning has been used to design policies that
citizens would be expected to follow if implemented. Much RL work assumes that
citizens follow these policies, and evaluate them with this in mind. However,
we know from prior work that without institutional trust, citizens will not
follow policies put in place by governments. In this work, we develop a
trust-aware RL algorithm for resource allocation in communities. We consider
the case of humanitarian engineering, where the organization is aiming to
distribute some technology or resource to community members. We use a Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient approach to learn a resource allocation that fits
the needs of the organization. Then, we simulate resource allocation according
to the learned policy, and model the changes in institutional trust of
community members. We investigate how this incorporation of institutional trust
affects outcomes, and ask how effectively an organization can learn policies if
trust values are private. We find that incorporating trust into RL algorithms
can lead to more successful policies, specifically when the organization's
goals are less certain. We find more conservative trust estimates lead to
increased fairness and average community trust, though organization success
suffers. Finally, we explore a strategy to prevent unfair outcomes to
communities. We implement a quota system by an external entity which decreases
the organization's utility when it does not serve enough community members. We
find this intervention can improve fairness and trust among communities in some
cases, while decreasing the success of the organization. This work underscores
the importance of institutional trust in algorithm design and implementation,
and identifies a tension between organization success and community well-being.

Conclusion: 基于高阶累积量矩阵的方法能够在复杂潜在变量场景下有效识别因果关系，且无需迭代过程，为因果发现提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Recovering causal structure in the presence of latent variables is an
important but challenging task. While many methods have been proposed to handle
it, most of them require strict and/or untestable assumptions on the causal
structure. In real-world scenarios, observed variables may be affected by
multiple latent variables simultaneously, which, generally speaking, cannot be
handled by these methods. In this paper, we consider the linear, non-Gaussian
case, and make use of the joint higher-order cumulant matrix of the observed
variables constructed in a specific way. We show that, surprisingly, causal
asymmetry between two observed variables can be directly seen from the rank
deficiency properties of such higher-order cumulant matrices, even in the
presence of an arbitrary number of latent confounders. Identifiability results
are established, and the corresponding identification methods do not even
involve iterative procedures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and asymptotic correctness of our proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习依赖显式模型和领域假设，限制了灵活性和可解释性，需要一种更直接的数据分析方法。

Method: 使用surprisal（信息论不确定性）量化相关性，通过不确定性实现通用推理，包括生成推理、因果发现、异常检测和时间序列预测。

Result: 在大多数常见机器学习任务中达到或接近最先进性能，能够有效处理复杂数据类型（包括缺失数据）。

Conclusion: 这可能是神经网络之外的可扩展机器学习替代路径，能够保持底层机制的人类可理解性，创建了信息的"物理学"基础。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning relies on explicit models and domain
assumptions, limiting flexibility and interpretability. We introduce a
model-free framework using surprisal (information theoretic uncertainty) to
directly analyze and perform inferences from raw data, eliminating distribution
modeling, reducing bias, and enabling efficient updates including direct edits
and deletion of training data. By quantifying relevance through uncertainty,
the approach enables generalizable inference across tasks including generative
inference, causal discovery, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting. It
emphasizes traceability, interpretability, and data-driven decision making,
offering a unified, human-understandable framework for machine learning, and
achieves at or near state-of-the-art performance across most common machine
learning tasks. The mathematical foundations create a ``physics'' of
information, which enable these techniques to apply effectively to a wide
variety of complex data types, including missing data. Empirical results
indicate that this may be a viable alternative path to neural networks with
regard to scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence that can
maintain human understandability of the underlying mechanics.

Abstract: We study the effect of normalization schemes on token representations in deep

we show that normalization acts as a form of speed regulation. This perspective
enables a unified analysis of several schemes -- including Post-LN, Pre-LN,
Mix-LN, Peri-LN, nGPT, and LN-Scaling -- revealing how they influence

different schemes shape token representations across layers and provides a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序数据存在测量噪声和生物变异性，导致在标准潜在空间中不同细胞类型的数据可能投影得很接近，使得准确聚类变得困难。

Method: 引入潜在即插即用扩散框架，分离观测和去噪空间。通过新颖的吉布斯采样程序：在低维潜在空间应用学习的扩散先验进行去噪，同时在原始高维观测空间重新引入噪声来指导这一过程。

Result: 在合成数据和真实单细胞基因组数据上评估了鲁棒性。在合成数据上，在不同噪声水平和数据集偏移下提高了聚类精度。在真实单细胞数据上，得到的细胞簇具有更好的生物一致性，簇边界与已知细胞类型标记和发育轨迹更吻合。

Conclusion: 该方法通过输入空间指导的独特机制，提供了自适应噪声处理、不确定性量化和可泛化去噪三个关键优势，显著提高了单细胞数据的聚类质量和生物解释性。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular
heterogeneity. Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based
on cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological
variability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from
different cell types can be projected close together, making accurate
clustering difficult. We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework
that separates the observation and denoising space. This separation is
operationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion
prior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while
to steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional
observation space. This unique "input-space steering" ensures the denoising
trajectory remains faithful to the original data structure. Our approach offers
three key advantages: (1) adaptive noise handling via a tunable balance between
prior and observed data; (2) uncertainty quantification through principled
uncertainty estimates for downstream analysis; and (3) generalizable denoising
by leveraging clean reference data to denoise noisier datasets, and via
averaging, improve quality beyond the training set. We evaluate robustness on
both synthetic and real single-cell genomics data. Our method improves
clustering accuracy on synthetic data across varied noise levels and dataset
shifts. On real-world single-cell data, our method demonstrates improved
biological coherence in the resulting cell clusters, with cluster boundaries
that better align with known cell type markers and developmental trajectories.

TL;DR: 提出了一个物理信息机器学习框架，用于建模和预测随机FitzHugh-Nagumo神经元中的自诱导随机共振现象，通过将随机微分方程和物理约束嵌入神经网络，显著提高了预测精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自诱导随机共振(SISR)是慢-快可激发系统中仅由噪声驱动产生相干振荡的现象，传统方法计算成本高且缺乏物理可解释性，需要开发数据高效且物理一致的建模方法。

Method: 基于噪声增强状态预测器的物理信息神经网络(PINN)，将随机微分方程和SISR渐近时间尺度匹配约束直接嵌入网络，复合损失函数包含数据保真度、动力学残差和基于Kramers逃逸理论的物理约束。

Result: 训练后的PINN准确预测了尖峰序列相干性对噪声强度、可激发性和时间尺度分离的依赖关系，与直接随机模拟结果匹配，相比纯数据驱动方法在精度和泛化方面有显著提升，且计算量大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该框架为模拟和分析多尺度随机系统中的噪声诱导相干性提供了一个数据高效且可解释的代理模型，在神经科学和复杂系统研究中具有应用价值。

Abstract: Self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR) is the emergence of coherent
oscillations in slow-fast excitable systems driven solely by noise, without
external periodic forcing or proximity to a bifurcation. This work presents a
physics-informed machine learning framework for modeling and predicting SISR in
the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron. We embed the governing stochastic
differential equations and SISR-asymptotic timescale-matching constraints
directly into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based on a
Noise-Augmented State Predictor architecture. The composite loss integrates
data fidelity, dynamical residuals, and barrier-based physical constraints
derived from Kramers' escape theory. The trained PINN accurately predicts the
dependence of spike-train coherence on noise intensity, excitability, and
timescale separation, matching results from direct stochastic simulations with
substantial improvements in accuracy and generalization compared with purely
data-driven methods, while requiring significantly less computation. The
framework provides a data-efficient and interpretable surrogate model for
simulating and analyzing noise-induced coherence in multiscale stochastic
systems.

Method: 引入分数各向异性方向(SADs)作为架构依赖的方向，分析其如何形成与架构输出几何对齐的自适应基，提供预测分数模型泛化能力的原则性方法。

Result: 在合成数据和标准图像基准上的实验表明，SADs可靠地捕捉了细粒度模型行为，并与基于Wasserstein度量的下游性能相关。

Conclusion: 该工作为解释和预测生成模型的方向性偏置提供了新的视角，SADs能够揭示架构相关的归纳偏置模式。

Abstract: We investigate the role of network architecture in shaping the inductive
biases of modern score-based generative models. To this end, we introduce the
Score Anisotropy Directions (SADs), architecture-dependent directions that
reveal how different networks preferentially capture data structure. Our
analysis shows that SADs form adaptive bases aligned with the architecture's
output geometry, providing a principled way to predict generalization ability
in score models prior to training. Through both synthetic data and standard
image benchmarks, we demonstrate that SADs reliably capture fine-grained model
behavior and correlate with downstream performance, as measured by Wasserstein
metrics. Our work offers a new lens for explaining and predicting directional
biases of generative models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在高维空间中生成反事实解释的方法SSBA，通过分段采样逼近决策边界并找到最近可行点，在四个数据集上相比现有方法将L2距离减少5%-50%，并能处理现实约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法在高维空间中效果有限，难以处理现实约束（如年龄、性别等不可变特征），需要一种简单有效的模型无关方法来生成可行的反事实解释。

Method: 使用四步法：拟合数据集到模型、找到决策边界、确定问题约束、计算边界上最近点。提出分段采样边界逼近(SSBA)方法，通过二分查找找到决策边界点，然后搜索最近边界点。

Result: 在四个不同维度数据集上，SSBA方法相比当前方法在L2距离上减少5%-50%，能处理不可变和分类特征的约束，运行时间比基于网格的方法快多个数量级。

Conclusion: SSBA提供了一种简单有效的模型无关方法，能够计算最近可行（符合现实约束）的反事实解释，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: In our article, we describe a method for generating counterfactual
explanations in high-dimensional spaces using four steps that involve fitting
our dataset to a model, finding the decision boundary, determining constraints
on the problem, and computing the closest point (counterfactual explanation)
from that boundary. We propose a discretized approach where we find many
discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible
counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\textit{Segmented
Sampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find
decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point.
Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can
outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in
distance between $5\%$ to $50\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can
also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and
categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related
characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of
runtime, the SSBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple
orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based
approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic
method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints)
counterfactual explanations. All of our results and our code can be found here

Motivation: CKA作为流行的表示比较指标，未考虑底层流形结构且依赖启发式方法，在不同数据规模下表现不一致

Method: 开发了MKA的理论框架，在合成数据集和真实世界示例上进行实证评估，与现有方法对比

Result: 流形感知的核对齐为表示度量提供了更稳健的基础

Conclusion: MKA在表示学习等领域具有潜在应用价值

Abstract: Centered kernel alignment (CKA) is a popular metric for comparing
representations, determining equivalence of networks, and neuroscience
research. However, CKA does not account for the underlying manifold and relies
on numerous heuristics that cause it to behave differently at different scales
of data. In this work, we propose Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA),
which incorporates manifold geometry into the alignment task. We derive a
theoretical framework for MKA. We perform empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets and real-world examples to characterize and compare MKA to its
contemporaries. Our findings suggest that manifold-aware kernel alignment
provides a more robust foundation for measuring representations, with potential
applications in representation learning.

Motivation: 随着Muon和Shampoo等谱感知矩阵值优化器在深度学习中的广泛应用，需要系统研究它们的泛化特性，特别是确定在什么情况下它们能胜过竞争算法。

Method: 使用不平衡数据作为测试平台，研究谱梯度下降(SpecGD)的规范形式，并在高斯混合数据模型和线性/双线性模型中量化SpecGD何时优于传统GD。

Result: 研究发现，与GD优先学习数据的主要主成分不同，SpecGD以相等的速率学习所有数据主成分，这导致SpecGD在训练早期具有更好的平衡准确率，且这种优势在使用自适应步长时仍然保持。

Conclusion: 谱优化器通过促进数据底层组件的更平衡学习来实现更好的泛化性能，深度会放大这些效应，这一发现在各种不平衡数据集上得到了实证验证。

Abstract: The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon
and Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their
generalization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform
competitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate
simplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a
testbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is
Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\Sigma
V^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we
identify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD
outperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both
linear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning
dominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal
components of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a
growing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further
show that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive
step-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models,
we show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our
theoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments
compare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against
their Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that
these spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more
balanced learning of the data's underlying components.

Abstract: Power flow (PF) calculations are the backbone of real-time grid operations,
across workflows such as contingency analysis (where repeated PF evaluations
assess grid security under outages) and topology optimization (which involves
PF-based searches over combinatorially large action spaces). Running these
calculations at operational timescales or across large evaluation spaces
remains a major computational bottleneck. Additionally, growing uncertainty in
power system operations from the integration of renewables and climate-induced
extreme weather also calls for tools that can accurately and efficiently
simulate a wide range of scenarios and operating conditions. Machine learning
methods offer a potential speedup over traditional solvers, but their
performance has not been systematically assessed on benchmarks that capture
real-world variability. This paper introduces PF$\Delta$, a benchmark dataset
for power flow that captures diverse variations in load, generation, and
topology. PF$\Delta$ contains 859,800 solved power flow instances spanning six
different bus system sizes, capturing three types of contingency scenarios (N ,
N -1, and N -2), and including close-to-infeasible cases near steady-state
voltage stability limits. We evaluate traditional solvers and GNN-based
methods, highlighting key areas where existing approaches struggle, and
identifying open problems for future research. Our dataset is available at

Abstract: Random Forests (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are two of the
most widely used and highly performing classification and regression models.
They aggregate equally weighted CART trees, generated randomly in RF or
sequentially in XGBoost. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Forests (AF), a
novel approach that adaptively selects the weights of the underlying CART
models. AF combines (a) the Optimal Predictive-Policy Trees (OP2T) framework to
prescribe tailored, input-dependent unequal weights to trees and (b) Mixed
Integer Optimization (MIO) to refine weight candidates dynamically, enhancing
overall performance. We demonstrate that AF consistently outperforms RF,
XGBoost, and other weighted RF in binary and multi-class classification
problems over 20+ real-world datasets.

Abstract: With the rise of online and virtual learning, monitoring and enhancing
student engagement have become an important aspect of effective education.
Traditional methods of assessing a student's involvement might not be
applicable directly to virtual environments. In this study, we focused on this
problem and addressed the need to develop an automated system to detect student
engagement levels during online learning. We proposed a novel training method
which can discourage a model from leveraging sensitive features like gender for
its predictions. The proposed method offers benefits not only in the
enforcement of ethical standards, but also to enhance interpretability of the
model predictions. We applied an attribute-orthogonal regularization technique
to a split-model classifier, which uses multiple transfer learning strategies
to achieve effective results in reducing disparity in the distribution of
prediction for sensitivity groups from a Pearson correlation coefficient of
0.897 for the unmitigated model, to 0.999 for the mitigated model. The source

Motivation: 在大规模和动态数据流中，设计能够保持数据结构特性同时支持高效查询的紧凑草图是一个核心挑战。

Method: 开发了新的草图算法，在流式模型中使用局部敏感哈希存储子线性比例的数据，在滑动窗口模型中设计特定大小的草图结构。

Result: ANN算法仅需存储总输入的n^{-η}比例，内存为O(n^{1+ρ-η})；A-KDE在滑动窗口中的草图大小为O(RW·(1/√(1+ε)-1)·log²N)，均为首个理论子线性保证。

Conclusion: 所提出的草图算法在理论和实验上都表现出色，为动态数据流中的ANN和A-KDE问题提供了轻量级且低误差的解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search and Approximate Kernel Density
Estimation (A-KDE) are fundamental problems at the core of modern machine
learning, with broad applications in data analysis, information systems, and
large-scale decision making. In massive and dynamic data streams, a central
challenge is to design compact sketches that preserve essential structural
properties of the data while enabling efficient queries.
  In this work, we develop new sketching algorithms that achieve sublinear
space and query time guarantees for both ANN and A-KDE for a dynamic stream of
data. For ANN in the streaming model, under natural assumptions, we design a
sublinear sketch that requires only $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\rho-\eta})$ memory by
storing only a sublinear ($n^{-\eta}$) fraction of the total inputs, where
$\rho$ is a parameter of the LSH family, and $0<\eta<1$. Our method supports
sublinear query time, batch queries, and extends to the more general Turnstile
model. While earlier works have focused on Exact NN, this is the first result
on ANN that achieves near-optimal trade-offs between memory size and
approximation error.
  Next, for A-KDE in the Sliding-Window model, we propose a sketch of size
$\mathcal{O}\left(RW \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\epsilon} - 1} \log^2 N\right)$,
where $R$ is the number of sketch rows, $W$ is the LSH range, $N$ is the window
size, and $\epsilon$ is the approximation error. This, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first theoretical sublinear sketch guarantee for A-KDE in the
Sliding-Window model.
  We complement our theoretical results with experiments on various real-world
datasets, which show that the proposed sketches are lightweight and achieve
consistently low error in practice.

TL;DR: 该研究实证分析了三种剪枝方法和三种量化方法在不同GNN模型上的效果，发现非结构化细粒度和全局剪枝能显著减少模型大小(50%)，同时保持或提高精度；量化方法在不同数据集上对精度、推理时间和模型大小的影响各异。

Conclusion: 剪枝和量化是有效的GNN压缩技术，非结构化剪枝在保持精度的同时显著减少模型大小，而量化方法的效果取决于具体数据集。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to operate with high accuracy on
learning from graph-structured data, but they suffer from high computational
and resource costs. Neural network compression methods are used to reduce the
model size while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Two of the common neural
network compression techniques include pruning and quantization. In this
research, we empirically examine the effects of three pruning methods and three
quantization methods on different GNN models, including graph classification
tasks, node classification tasks, and link prediction. We conducted all
experiments on three graph datasets, including Cora, Proteins, and BBBP. Our
findings demonstrate that unstructured fine-grained and global pruning can
significantly reduce the model's size(50\%) while maintaining or even improving
precision after fine-tuning the pruned model. The evaluation of different
quantization methods on GNN shows diverse impacts on accuracy, inference time,
and model size across different datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的框架阐明了基准分数支持多样化科学主张的条件，将预测性基准测试置于机器学习中概念和理论推理的关键位置。

Abstract: Predictive benchmarking, the evaluation of machine learning models based on
predictive performance and competitive ranking, is a central epistemic practice
in machine learning research and an increasingly prominent method for
scientific inquiry. Yet, benchmark scores alone provide at best measurements of
model performance relative to an evaluation dataset and a concrete learning
problem. Drawing substantial scientific inferences from the results, say about
theoretical tasks like image classification, requires additional assumptions
about the theoretical structure of the learning problems, evaluation functions,
and data distributions. We make these assumptions explicit by developing
conditions of construct validity inspired by psychological measurement theory.
We examine these assumptions in practice through three case studies, each
exemplifying a typical intended inference: measuring engineering progress in
computer vision with ImageNet; evaluating policy-relevant weather predictions
with WeatherBench; and examining limitations of the predictability of life
events with the Fragile Families Challenge. Our framework clarifies the
conditions under which benchmark scores can support diverse scientific claims,
bringing predictive benchmarking into perspective as an epistemological
practice and a key site of conceptual and theoretical reasoning in machine
learning.

Motivation: 现有的隐量子马尔可夫模型学习算法对数据损坏高度敏感，缺乏在对抗性扰动下确保鲁棒性的机制。

Method: 提出RILA算法，结合了基于熵过滤的移除损坏行模块和迭代随机重采样过程，使用L1惩罚似然目标来增强稳定性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，RILA展现出优越的收敛稳定性、损坏恢复能力和物理有效性保持能力。

Conclusion: RILA为稳健的量子序列学习建立了一个原则性且高效的方法。

Abstract: Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs) extend classical Hidden Markov Models to
the quantum domain, offering a powerful probabilistic framework for modeling
sequential data with quantum coherence. However, existing HQMM learning
algorithms are highly sensitive to data corruption and lack mechanisms to
ensure robustness under adversarial perturbations. In this work, we introduce
the Adversarially Corrupted HQMM (AC-HQMM), which formalizes robustness
analysis by allowing a controlled fraction of observation sequences to be
adversarially corrupted. To learn AC-HQMMs, we propose the Robust Iterative
Learning Algorithm (RILA), a derivative-free method that integrates a Remove
Corrupted Rows by Entropy Filtering (RCR-EF) module with an iterative
stochastic resampling procedure for physically valid Kraus operator updates.
RILA incorporates L1-penalized likelihood objectives to enhance stability,
resist overfitting, and remain effective under non-differentiable conditions.
Across multiple HQMM and HMM benchmarks, RILA demonstrates superior convergence
stability, corruption resilience, and preservation of physical validity
compared to existing algorithms, establishing a principled and efficient
approach for robust quantum sequential learning.

TL;DR: 提出GCAO聚类算法，通过群体驱动的引力优化机制解决高维非均匀分布数据中低密度边界样本易受干扰的问题，显著提升聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法在高维非均匀分布数据中表现不佳，低密度边界样本容易被邻近聚类干扰，导致聚类结果不稳定和失真。

Method: 引入群体级优化机制，将低密度边界点聚合成协作移动的群体；结合局部密度估计和邻域拓扑构建群体与周围环境的有效引力交互；使用群体作为基本运动单元，采用引力收缩策略确保全局稳定和方向一致的收敛。

Result: 在多个高维数据集上的实验表明，GCAO优于11种代表性聚类方法，在NMI、ARI、Homogeneity和ACC指标上分别平均提升37.13%、52.08%、44.98%和38.81%，同时保持竞争性的效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: GCAO在保持聚类完整性、增强边界可分性和确保复杂数据分布上的鲁棒性能方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Traditional clustering algorithms often struggle with high-dimensional and
non-uniformly distributed data, where low-density boundary samples are easily
disturbed by neighboring clusters, leading to unstable and distorted clustering
results. To address this issue, we propose a Group-driven Clustering via
Gravitational Attraction and Optimization (GCAO) algorithm. GCAO introduces a
group-level optimization mechanism that aggregates low-density boundary points
into collaboratively moving groups, replacing the traditional point-based
contraction process. By combining local density estimation with neighborhood
topology, GCAO constructs effective gravitational interactions between groups
and their surroundings, enhancing boundary clarity and structural consistency.
Using groups as basic motion units, a gravitational contraction strategy
ensures globally stable and directionally consistent convergence. Experiments
on multiple high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that GCAO outperforms 11
representative clustering methods, achieving average improvements of 37.13%,
52.08%, 44.98%, and 38.81% in NMI, ARI, Homogeneity, and ACC, respectively,
while maintaining competitive efficiency and scalability. These results
highlight GCAO's superiority in preserving cluster integrity, enhancing
boundary separability, and ensuring robust performance on complex data
distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统近端梯度算法在图像重建等逆问题中经常产生不稳定收敛和次优解，主要原因是梯度下降步骤引入负值并导致对超参数高度敏感。

Method: 用可学习的Sigmoid算子替代梯度下降步骤，将减法更新转换为乘法更新，强制实施非负性和有界性；通过滑动参数增强稳定性和收敛性；将优化算法展开为深度网络。

Result: 大量数值和真实世界实验表明，该方法显著优于传统PGA和其他最先进算法，确保卓越性能和稳定性。

Conclusion: SSO-PGA通过乘法更新机制有效解决了非负逆问题中的约束违反问题，结合了优化的可解释性和深度学习的强大能力。

Abstract: Proximal gradient algorithms (PGA), while foundational for inverse problems
like image reconstruction, often yield unstable convergence and suboptimal
solutions by violating the critical non-negativity constraint. We identify the
gradient descent step as the root cause of this issue, which introduces
negative values and induces high sensitivity to hyperparameters. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel multiplicative update proximal gradient
algorithm (SSO-PGA) with convergence guarantees, which is designed for
robustness in non-negative inverse problems. Our key innovation lies in
superseding the gradient descent step with a learnable sigmoid-based operator,
which inherently enforces non-negativity and boundedness by transforming
traditional subtractive updates into multiplicative ones. This design,
augmented by a sliding parameter for enhanced stability and convergence, not
only improves robustness but also boosts expressive capacity and noise
immunity. We further formulate a degradation model for multi-modal restoration
and derive its SSO-PGA-based optimization algorithm, which is then unfolded
into a deep network to marry the interpretability of optimization with the
power of deep learning. Extensive numerical and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses traditional PGA and other
state-of-the-art algorithms, ensuring superior performance and stability.

Result: 从GPT-4.1轨迹蒸馏的SFT模型性能相当但体积小56倍；RL在匹配训练测试条件下带来7-20%的绝对提升；"思考模式"在实验中表现相同或更差；SFT和RL模型都无法跨环境泛化。

Conclusion: 训练测试环境的匹配对于构建可靠的现实世界代码修复代理至关重要，模型在跨环境泛化方面存在挑战。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of training reliable code-fixing agents in real
repositories, where complex builds and shifting dependencies make evaluation
unstable. We developed a verifiable pipeline with success defined as post-fix
build validation and improved reproducibility across ~1K real issues by pinning
dependencies and disabling automatic upgrades. Building on this, we introduced
a scalable simplified pipeline for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL).
Using this setup, we supervised fine-tuned Qwen3-32B in the full pipeline and
applied RL on top of the SFT model in the simplified environment. The SFT model
distilled from GPT-4.1 trajectories performs on par while being 56x smaller,
and RL added 7-20% absolute gains under matched train-test conditions.
"Thinking mode" was on par or worse in our experiments. Both SFT and RL models
failed to generalize across environments, highlighting the importance of
matching train-test environments for building reliable real-world code-fixing
agents.

Motivation: 当输入数据集被随机噪声污染时，评估核心集质量具有挑战性，因为真实的基础数据集无法观测。需要研究使用可处理的替代误差度量来构建核心集。

Method: 分析了传统度量方法，引入了一种新的误差度量方法，该方法更接近真实聚类成本。设计了基于该度量的核心集构建算法，并在数据和噪声的温和假设下实施ε-边界约束。

Result: 实验证明，与经典度量方法相比，使用新度量方法可以获得更小的核心集（最多可减少poly(k)倍）和更紧的真实聚类成本保证。

Conclusion: 提出的新误差度量方法在理论和实践中都优于传统方法，能够在噪声环境下构建更高效的核心集。

Abstract: We study the problem of constructing coresets for $(k, z)$-clustering when
the input dataset is corrupted by stochastic noise drawn from a known
distribution. In this setting, evaluating the quality of a coreset is
inherently challenging, as the true underlying dataset is unobserved. To
address this, we investigate coreset construction using surrogate error metrics
that are tractable and provably related to the true clustering cost. We analyze
a traditional metric from prior work and introduce a new error metric that more
closely aligns with the true cost. Although our metric is defined independently
of the noise distribution, it enables approximation guarantees that scale with
the noise level. We design a coreset construction algorithm based on this
metric and show that, under mild assumptions on the data and noise, enforcing
an $\varepsilon$-bound under our metric yields smaller coresets and tighter
guarantees on the true clustering cost than those obtained via classical
metrics. In particular, we prove that the coreset size can improve by a factor
of up to $\mathrm{poly}(k)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Experiments on
real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
practical advantages of our approach.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了长期天气预报的准确性和可靠性，还通过降低训练成本解决了机器学习规模增长带来的可持续性和可访问性问题。

Abstract: Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by
global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure.
Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes
unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods
cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale
representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends,
weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast
and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a
multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a
Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward
traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields
across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead
times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability
for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a
single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such
efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges
sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in
the supplementary materials.

from an information-theoretic perspective. We focus on two scenarios: (i) when
the testing environment mismatches the training environment, and (ii) when the
training environment is broader than the testing environment. The first
corresponds to the standard distribution mismatch setting, while the second
reflects a broad-to-narrow training scenario. We further formalize the

corresponding generalization bounds. Finally, we analyze the generalization
performance of a gradient-based meta-reinforcement learning algorithm.

Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling plays a critical role
in drug development by predicting drug concentration dynamics across organs.
Traditional approaches rely on ordinary differential equations with strong
simplifying assumptions, which limit their adaptability to nonlinear
physiological interactions. In this study, we explore data-driven alternatives
for PBPK prediction using deep learning. Two baseline architectures - a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - are
implemented to capture molecular and temporal dependencies, respectively. To
incorporate inter-organ interactions, we propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Network
(Dynamic GNN) that models physiological connections as recurrent
message-passing processes between organs. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed Dynamic GNN achieves the highest predictive performance among all
models, with an R^2 of 0.9342, an RMSE of 0.0159, and an MAE of 0.0116. In
comparison, the MLP baseline obtains an R^2 of 0.8705 and the LSTM achieves
0.8059. These results highlight that explicitly modeling the spatial and
temporal dependencies of organ interactions enables more accurate and
generalizable drug concentration prediction. The Dynamic GNN provides a
scalable, equation-free alternative to traditional PBPK formulations and
demonstrates strong potential for data-driven pharmacokinetic modeling in
preclinical and clinical research.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves
privacy by eliminating the need to exchange raw data during training. In its
prototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled
by analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \emph{over-the-air
FL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \emph{frenemy}
in the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while
providing a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms,
formally quantified by \emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains,
nevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as
prior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted
types of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a
single-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study
AirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station
(BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which
claimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to
ensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as
a \emph{perk} even \emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a
novel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on
model parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and
non-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power
allocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which
also reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising
training. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive
numerical results.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to efficiently remove sensitive or harmful
memory from a pre-trained model. The key challenge is to balance the potential
tradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves
forgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's
original performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use
multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and
utility preservation objectives. However, existing multi-objective methods only
guarantee finding a Pareto-optimal solution without fine-grained control, which
causes under-optimization of the unlearning objective. To this end, we first
model MU as a constrained optimization problem, that is, optimizing the
unlearning objective under the constraint of a bounded increase for utility
loss. We then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to
unilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective. To resolve the
additional computational cost brought by gradient surgery, we propose an
implicit gradient surgery method, which approximates the solution to the
aforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation,
thereby achieving efficient utility-preserving MU. Theoretically, we provide a
tight convergence analysis of the algorithm. Empirically, our extensive
experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better tradeoff results
than existing baselines. Codes are available at

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has achieved remarkable performance,
yet its learned model representations and decision rationale remain a black
box. This impedes both academic research and practical deployment, since
researchers and stakeholders require deeper insights into NCO models. In this
paper, we take the first critical step towards interpreting NCO models by
investigating their representations through various probing tasks. Moreover, we
introduce a novel probing tool named Coefficient Significance Probing
(CS-Probing) to enable deeper analysis of NCO representations by examining the
coefficients and statistical significance during probing. Extensive experiments
and analysis reveal that NCO models encode low-level information essential for
solution construction, while capturing high-level knowledge to facilitate
better decisions. Using CS-Probing, we find that prevalent NCO models impose
varying inductive biases on their learned representations, uncover direct
evidence related to model generalization, and identify key embedding dimensions
associated with specific knowledge. These insights can be potentially
translated into practice, for example, with minor code modifications, we
improve the generalization of the analyzed model. Our work represents a first
systematic attempt to interpret black-box NCO models, showcasing probing as a
promising tool for analyzing their internal mechanisms and revealing insights
for the NCO community. The source code is publicly available.

*Farzaneh Heidari,Chao Li,Farzaneh Heidari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TN-SHAP使用张量网络替代模型，将Shapley值的O(2^n)联盟枚举简化为少量评估，显著加速特征交互分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Shapley值和交互指数需要枚举所有特征联盟，计算复杂度为O(2^n)，在大规模特征下不可行

Method: 将预测器的局部行为表示为因子化多线性映射，通过张量网络代理模型，用少量针对性评估提取k阶Shapley交互

Result: 在UCI数据集上，方法在保持精度的同时实现25-1000倍加速，显著减少评估次数

Conclusion: TN-SHAP通过张量网络有效解决了Shapley值计算的高复杂度问题，为大规模特征交互分析提供了可行方案

Abstract: We show how to replace the O(2^n) coalition enumeration over n features
behind Shapley values and Shapley-style interaction indices with a
few-evaluation scheme on a tensor-network (TN) surrogate: TN-SHAP. The key idea
is to represent a predictor's local behavior as a factorized multilinear map,
so that coalitional quantities become linear probes of a coefficient tensor.
TN-SHAP replaces exhaustive coalition sweeps with just a small number of
targeted evaluations to extract order-k Shapley interactions. In particular,
both order-1 (single-feature) and order-2 (pairwise) computations have cost
O(n*poly(chi) + n^2), where chi is the TN's maximal cut rank. We provide
theoretical guarantees on the approximation error and tractability of TN-SHAP.
On UCI datasets, our method matches enumeration on the fitted surrogate while
reducing evaluation by orders of magnitude and achieves 25-1000x wall-clock
speedups over KernelSHAP-IQ at comparable accuracy, while amortizing training
across local cohorts.

<details>

Motivation: 解决现有终身知识编辑方法在编辑过程中错误累积导致编辑精度和泛化能力逐渐下降的问题。

Method: 结合神经元功能归因识别知识通用神经元和知识特定神经元，引入熵引导的动态稀疏掩码定位目标知识相关神经元，实现精确的神经元级知识编辑。

Result: 在数千次顺序编辑实验中，NMKE在保持高编辑成功率和维护模型通用能力方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NMKE通过细粒度的神经元级编辑策略，有效解决了终身知识编辑中的错误累积问题，实现了更精确和可持续的知识更新。

Abstract: Lifelong knowledge editing enables continuous, precise updates to outdated
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without computationally expensive
full retraining. However, existing methods often accumulate errors throughout
the editing process, causing a gradual decline in both editing accuracy and
generalization. To tackle this problem, we propose Neuron-Specific Masked
Knowledge Editing (NMKE), a novel fine-grained editing framework that combines
neuron-level attribution with dynamic sparse masking. Leveraging neuron
functional attribution, we identify two key types of knowledge neurons, with
knowledge-general neurons activating consistently across prompts and
knowledge-specific neurons activating to specific prompts. NMKE further
introduces an entropy-guided dynamic sparse mask, locating relevant neurons to
the target knowledge. This strategy enables precise neuron-level knowledge
editing with fewer parameter modifications. Experimental results from thousands
of sequential edits demonstrate that NMKE outperforms existing methods in
maintaining high editing success rates and preserving model general
capabilities in lifelong editing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了"独裁者客户端"这一新型恶意参与者类别，能够在联邦学习中完全消除其他客户端的贡献，同时保留自己的贡献。论文分析了单/多独裁者客户端的不同攻击场景及其对模型收敛的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性使其容易受到恶意客户端的攻击，现有研究缺乏对能够完全控制模型训练过程的恶意参与者的系统性分析。

Method: 提出具体的攻击策略，让独裁者客户端能够操纵训练过程；理论分析单/多独裁者客户端在不同场景（合作、独立、背叛）下的影响；在计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准上进行实证评估。

Result: 独裁者客户端能够成功消除其他客户端的贡献；多独裁者场景中，合作、独立或背叛行为对模型收敛产生不同影响；理论分析得到实验验证。

Conclusion: 独裁者客户端构成了联邦学习中的严重安全威胁，需要开发新的防御机制来应对这类攻击。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized
model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared
model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of
FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or
manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a
novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants
capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the
server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies
that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the
learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple
dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or
form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these
settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global
model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex
scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by
empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing
benchmarks.

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了将深度强化学习技术应用于复杂均值场博弈问题的重要进展，使该领域更接近现实世界的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling
interactions in large-scale multi-agent systems. Despite recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) for MFGs, existing methods are typically limited to
finite spaces or stationary models, hindering their applicability to real-world
problems. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithm specifically designed for non-stationary continuous MFGs. The
proposed approach builds upon a Fictitious Play (FP) methodology, leveraging
DRL for best-response computation and supervised learning for average policy
representation. Furthermore, it learns a representation of the time-dependent
population distribution using a Conditional Normalizing Flow. To validate the
effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on three different examples of
increasing complexity. By addressing critical limitations in scalability and
density approximation, this work represents a significant advancement in
applying DRL techniques to complex MFG problems, bringing the field closer to
real-world multi-agent systems.

*Nadav Dym,Matthias Wellershoff,Efstratios Tsoukanis,Daniel Levy,Radu Balan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于排序的嵌入方法β_A，改进了嵌入维度D的上界并给出了下界，证明了双Lipschitz失真与n的二次方相关且与d无关，并给出了至少Ω(√n)的失真下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像深度学习中，需要处理图节点排列不变性的问题。之前的排序嵌入方法虽然证明了对于足够大的D和适当的A，映射β_A是单射且满足双Lipschitz条件，但存在两个关键问题：最优嵌入维度D未知，且缺乏双Lipschitz常数的估计。

Method: 使用基于排序的嵌入方法β_A: X ↦ ↓(XA)，其中↓表示矩阵的列排序。通过构造特定的矩阵A来分析嵌入维度和双Lipschitz失真，并对β_A的变体应用线性投影来降低输出维度。

Result: 改进了嵌入维度D的上界并提供了最小单射维度的下界；构造了使得β_A的双Lipschitz失真与n二次相关且与d无关的矩阵A；证明了β_A的失真至少为Ω(√n)；对β_A的变体也得到了类似结果。

Conclusion: 本文在排序嵌入的两个关键问题上取得了重要进展：确定了更优的嵌入维度边界，并首次给出了双Lipschitz失真的定量分析，为图深度学习中的排列不变表示提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study the sorting-based embedding $\beta_{\mathbf A} : \mathbb R^{n \times
d} \to \mathbb R^{n \times D}$, $\mathbf X \mapsto {\downarrow}(\mathbf X
\mathbf A)$, where $\downarrow$ denotes column wise sorting of matrices. Such
embeddings arise in graph deep learning where outputs should be invariant to
permutations of graph nodes. Previous work showed that for large enough $D$ and
appropriate $\mathbf A$, the mapping $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is injective, and
moreover satisfies a bi-Lipschitz condition. However, two gaps remain: firstly,
the optimal size $D$ required for injectivity is not yet known, and secondly,
no estimates of the bi-Lipschitz constants of the mapping are known.
  In this paper, we make substantial progress in addressing both of these gaps.
Regarding the first gap, we improve upon the best known upper bounds for the
embedding dimension $D$ necessary for injectivity, and also provide a lower
bound on the minimal injectivity dimension. Regarding the second gap, we
construct matrices $\mathbf A$, so that the bi-Lipschitz distortion of
$\beta_{\mathbf A} $ depends quadratically on $n$, and is completely
independent of $d$. We also show that the distortion of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is
necessarily at least in $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we provide similar results
for variants of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ obtained by applying linear projections to
reduce the output dimension of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对脑电信号情感识别的任务特定多数据集联合预训练框架，通过跨数据集协方差对齐损失和混合编码器，显著提升了少样本和零样本情感识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用预训练脑电模型在处理复杂任务（如情感识别）时存在困难，因为任务特定特征与广泛预训练方法不匹配。需要解决跨数据集分布差异、情感类别定义不一致和个体间变异性大的问题。

Method: 使用跨数据集协方差对齐损失来对齐不同数据集的二阶统计特性，无需大量标签或个体校准。提出混合编码器，结合类Mamba线性注意力通道编码器和时空动态模型，捕捉脑电信号的长期依赖和复杂动态。

Result: 在少样本情感识别中平均AUROC提升4.57%，在零样本泛化到新数据集时准确率提升11.92%。多数据集联合预训练比单数据集训练性能提升8.55%，且性能随预训练数据集数量增加而提升。

Conclusion: 该工作为任务特定预训练提供了可扩展框架，并展示了其在可泛化情感计算中的优势，代码已开源。

Abstract: Task-specific pre-training is essential when task representations diverge
from generic pre-training features. Existing task-general pre-training EEG
models struggle with complex tasks like emotion recognition due to mismatches
between task-specific features and broad pre-training approaches. This work
aims to develop a task-specific multi-dataset joint pre-training framework for
cross-dataset emotion recognition, tackling problems of large inter-dataset
distribution shifts, inconsistent emotion category definitions, and substantial
inter-subject variability. We introduce a cross-dataset covariance alignment
loss to align second-order statistical properties across datasets, enabling
robust generalization without the need for extensive labels or per-subject
calibration. To capture the long-term dependency and complex dynamics of EEG,
we propose a hybrid encoder combining a Mamba-like linear attention channel
encoder and a spatiotemporal dynamics model. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art large-scale EEG models by an average of 4.57% in AUROC for
few-shot emotion recognition and 11.92% in accuracy for zero-shot
generalization to a new dataset. Performance scales with the increase of
datasets used in pre-training. Multi-dataset joint pre-training achieves a
performance gain of 8.55% over single-dataset training. This work provides a
scalable framework for task-specific pre-training and highlights its benefit in
generalizable affective computing. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在有损压缩领域的应用，在重建保真度和压缩比之间进行权衡。

Method: 使用掩码语言模型预测被掩盖的内容，仅当模型预测错误时存储最小化的基于排名的修正，创建残差通道。

Result: EPC在比特率显著降低的情况下提供优于预测掩码基线的保真度，更有效地利用模型内在知识。

Conclusion: EPC在有损文本压缩中表现优异，通过残差通道实现连续率失真控制，比基线方法更高效。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve near-optimal lossless compression by
acting as powerful probability models. We investigate their use in the lossy
domain, where reconstruction fidelity is traded for higher compression ratios.
This paper introduces Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC), a lossy text codec
that leverages a Masked Language Model (MLM) as a decompressor. Instead of
storing a subset of original tokens, EPC allows the model to predict masked
content and stores minimal, rank-based corrections only when the model's top
prediction is incorrect. This creates a residual channel that offers continuous
rate-distortion control. We compare EPC to a simpler Predictive Masking (PM)
baseline and a transform-based Vector Quantisation with a Residual Patch
(VQ+RE) approach. Through an evaluation that includes precise bit accounting
and rate-distortion analysis, we demonstrate that EPC consistently dominates
PM, offering superior fidelity at a significantly lower bit rate by more
efficiently utilising the model's intrinsic knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练模型在不同设计选择下表现出不同的泛化行为，某些模型能掌握其他模型无法获得的数据特定洞察。本文旨在利用大型公开模型库作为模型改进的辅助资源。

Method: 提出数据分区策略，让预训练模型自主选择扮演学生（寻求知识）或教师（传授知识）角色，支持双向知识迁移和跨架构知识转移。

Result: 在图像分类中，ViT-B通过双向知识迁移性能提升约1.4%；在语义分割中，所有评估指标均得到提升；在视频显著性预测中达到新的SOTA；多模型知识迁移使所有参与者模型性能大幅提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用模型多样性进行知识迁移，在多个视觉任务中实现显著性能改进，证明了利用公开模型库作为辅助改进资源的可行性。

Abstract: Pretrained models are ubiquitous in the current deep learning landscape,
offering strong results on a broad range of tasks. Recent works have shown that
models differing in various design choices exhibit categorically diverse
generalization behavior, resulting in one model grasping distinct data-specific
insights unavailable to the other. In this paper, we propose to leverage large
publicly available model repositories as an auxiliary source of model
improvements. We introduce a data partitioning strategy where pretrained models
autonomously adopt either the role of a student, seeking knowledge, or that of
a teacher, imparting knowledge. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In image classification, we
improved the performance of ViT-B by approximately 1.4% through bidirectional
knowledge transfer with ViT-T. For semantic segmentation, our method boosted
all evaluation metrics by enabling knowledge transfer both within and across
backbone architectures. In video saliency prediction, our approach achieved a
new state-of-the-art. We further extend our approach to knowledge transfer
between multiple models, leading to considerable performance improvements for
all model participants.

Motivation: 在算法决策中，公平机器学习方法通常产生多个平衡预测公平性和性能的模型，这种多样性给利益相关者选择符合其特定需求和价值观的模型带来了挑战。

Method: 利用弱监督度量学习学习反映公平性和性能结果相似性的马氏距离，根据利益相关者相关标准构建模型特征重要性空间，然后应用k-means聚类基于转换后的特征重要性表示对模型进行分组。

Result: 该方法允许用户探索具有相似预测行为和公平性特征的模型集群，促进明智决策，帮助用户理解模型不仅在公平性-性能平衡方面存在差异，还在驱动预测的特征方面有所不同。

Conclusion: 提出的交互式框架通过结构化的模型探索和解释，有效解决了从多个公平机器学习模型中选择合适模型的问题，增强了利益相关者的决策能力。

Abstract: In the context of algorithmic decision-making, fair machine learning methods
often yield multiple models that balance predictive fairness and performance in
varying degrees. This diversity introduces a challenge for stakeholders who
must select a model that aligns with their specific requirements and values. To
address this, we propose an interactive framework that assists in navigating
and interpreting the trade-offs across a portfolio of models. Our approach
leverages weakly supervised metric learning to learn a Mahalanobis distance
that reflects similarity in fairness and performance outcomes, effectively
structuring the feature importance space of the models according to
stakeholder-relevant criteria. We then apply clustering technique (k-means) to
group models based on their transformed representations of feature importances,
allowing users to explore clusters of models with similar predictive behaviors
and fairness characteristics. This facilitates informed decision-making by
helping users understand how models differ not only in their
fairness-performance balance but also in the features that drive their
predictions.

Method: 通过广泛的实验，分析层剪枝对测试时扩展的影响，包括在不同推理基准上的性能变化，并深入分析其脆弱性机制。

Result: 即使只剪枝1-2层也会严重损害测试时扩展能力，长推理基准上的性能急剧下降，而知识密集和浅层推理任务性能保持稳定。标准监督微调无法恢复受损的测试时扩展。

Conclusion: 层剪枝对推理密集型LLMs存在根本性风险，需要重新思考层剪枝策略，开发能够保持推理鲁棒性的方法。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a widely adopted technique for improving the
efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods
demonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their
effect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on
long-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in
modern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more
computation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
pruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with
performance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when
performance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.
Furthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to
recover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated. Through in-depth analyses,
we identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of test-time scaling and
highlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to
reasoning-intensive LLMs. These findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning
strategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the
robustness of reasoning. We open-source the codebase in

Motivation: 解决脑电图数据中电极布局异构性问题，传统方法难以在不同电极配置间泛化，限制了大规模模型构建。

Method: 使用学习查询和交叉注意力将多通道EEG压缩到固定大小的拓扑无关潜在空间，下游transformer块仅在此潜在表示上操作，采用掩码补丁重建目标进行预训练。

Conclusion: LUNA成功解决了EEG电极布局异构性问题，为构建可扩展的脑电图基础模型提供了有效方案，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive lens into human brain
activity, but building large-scale models is hampered by topological
heterogeneity: each public EEG data defines its own electrode layout, limiting
generalization. We introduce LUNA (Latent Unified Network Architecture), a
self-supervised foundation model that reconciles disparate electrode geometries
while scaling linearly -- not quadratically -- with channel count. LUNA
compresses multi-channel EEG into a fixed-size, topology-agnostic latent space
via learned queries and cross-attention. Downstream transformer blocks then
operate exclusively on this latent representation using patch-wise temporal
self-attention, decoupling computation from electrode count. Pre-trained on
TUEG and Siena (over 21,000 hours of raw EEG across diverse montages) using a
masked-patch reconstruction objective, LUNA transfers effectively to four
downstream tasks: abnormality detection, artifact rejection, slowing
classification, and emotion recognition. It demonstrates highly competitive
performance across several benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on
TUAR and TUSL, e.g., 0.921 AUROC on TUAR, while reducing FLOPs by 300x and
trimming GPU memory use by up to 10x. Critically, these gains are consistent
across all evaluated electrode configurations. Code is available at

Conclusion: 真正的智能涉及识别和管理自身知识的局限，'知道何时不知道'的能力应成为稳健可靠系统的标志。

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable successes, yet its deployment in
safety-critical domains remains hindered by an inherent inability to manage
uncertainty, resulting in overconfident and unreliable predictions when models
encounter out-of-distribution data, adversarial perturbations, or naturally
fluctuating environments. This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling
Machine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these
critical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial
Intelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the
uncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as
opposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby
empowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from
overconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.
  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network
(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief
functions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty
through the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including
its adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather
classification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a
unified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers. Extensive
experiments validate that integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning
not only mitigates the risks associated with overconfident predictions but also
lays the foundation for a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where the
ability to 'know when it does not know' becomes a hallmark of robust and
dependable systems. The title encapsulates the core philosophy of this work,
emphasizing that true intelligence involves recognizing and managing the limits
of one's own knowledge.

Abstract: Identifying the factors that influence student performance in basic education
is a central challenge for formulating effective public policies in Brazil.
This study introduces a multi-level machine learning approach to classify the
proficiency of 9th-grade and high school students using microdata from the
System of Assessment of Basic Education (SAEB). Our model uniquely integrates
four data sources: student socioeconomic characteristics, teacher professional
profiles, school indicators, and director management profiles. A comparative
analysis of four ensemble algorithms confirmed the superiority of a Random
Forest model, which achieved 90.2% accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC)
of 96.7%. To move beyond prediction, we applied Explainable AI (XAI) using
SHAP, which revealed that the school's average socioeconomic level is the most
dominant predictor, demonstrating that systemic factors have a greater impact
than individual characteristics in isolation. The primary conclusion is that
academic performance is a systemic phenomenon deeply tied to the school's
ecosystem. This study provides a data-driven, interpretable tool to inform
policies aimed at promoting educational equity by addressing disparities
between schools.

Abstract: The growing instability of both global and domestic economic environments has
increased the risk of financial distress at the household level. However,
traditional econometric models often rely on delayed and aggregated data,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a machine learning-based
early warning system that utilizes real-time digital and macroeconomic signals
to identify financial distress in near real-time. Using a panel dataset of 750
households tracked over three monitoring rounds spanning 13 months, the
framework combines socioeconomic attributes, macroeconomic indicators (such as
GDP growth, inflation, and foreign exchange fluctuations), and digital economy
measures (including ICT demand and market volatility). Through data
preprocessing and feature engineering, we introduce lagged variables,
volatility measures, and interaction terms to capture both gradual and sudden
changes in financial stability. We benchmark baseline classifiers, such as
logistic regression and decision trees, against advanced ensemble models
including random forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Our results indicate that the
engineered features from the digital economy significantly enhance predictive
accuracy. The system performs reliably for both binary distress detection and
multi-class severity classification, with SHAP-based explanations identifying
inflation volatility and ICT demand as key predictors. Crucially, the framework
is designed for scalable deployment in national agencies and low-bandwidth
regional offices, ensuring it is accessible for policymakers and practitioners.
By implementing machine learning in a transparent and interpretable manner,
this study demonstrates the feasibility and impact of providing near-real-time
early warnings of financial distress. This offers actionable insights that can
strengthen household resilience and guide preemptive intervention strategies.

### [124] [Does Homophily Help in Robust Test-time Node Classification?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22289)
*Yan Jiang,Ruihong Qiu,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了GrapHoST方法，通过在测试时调整图结构（增加同质性图的同质性或降低异质性图的同质性）来提升预训练GNN模型在节点分类任务中的鲁棒性和性能，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的测试图常存在数据质量问题和分布偏移，这会显著降低预训练模型的鲁棒性和性能。研究发现通过调整测试图结构中的同质性水平可以有效解决这一问题。

Method: 开发了同质性预测器来识别测试边，根据预测的同质性得分置信度自适应地进行测试时图结构转换。

Result: 在9个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，GrapHoST在各种测试时数据质量问题下始终达到最先进性能，提升幅度最高达10.92%。

Conclusion: 测试时图结构转换是提升预训练GNN模型鲁棒性的有效方法，GrapHoST通过自适应调整同质性水平实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Homophily, the tendency of nodes from the same class to connect, is a
fundamental property of real-world graphs, underpinning structural and semantic
patterns in domains such as citation networks and social networks. Existing
methods exploit homophily through designing homophily-aware GNN architectures
or graph structure learning strategies, yet they primarily focus on GNN
learning with training graphs. However, in real-world scenarios, test graphs
often suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts, such as domain
shifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal
evolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time
periods. These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's
robustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical
observations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test
graph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it
in heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance
of pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training
or update. Motivated by these insights, a novel test-time graph structural
transformation method grounded in homophily, named GrapHoST, is proposed.
Specifically, a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges,
facilitating adaptive test-time graph structural transformation by the
confidence of predicted homophily scores. Extensive experiments on nine
benchmark datasets under a range of test-time data quality issues demonstrate
that GrapHoST consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 10.92%. Our code has been released at
https://github.com/YanJiangJerry/GrapHoST.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了MASER预测模型，用于预测代谢功能障碍相关脂肪肝病(MASLD)，使用LASSO逻辑回归和公平性后处理，在大型电子健康记录数据库中实现了竞争性性能(AUROC 0.84)和跨种族亚组的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MASLD影响约33%的美国成年人，是最常见的慢性肝病。早期检测很重要，因为生活方式干预可以预防疾病进展。需要开发公平、严谨且可重复的预测模型。

Method: 评估了LASSO逻辑回归、随机森林、XGBoost和神经网络，使用临床特征子集(包括前10个SHAP排名特征)。应用机会均等后处理方法减少种族和民族亚组间的真阳性率差异。

Result: 训练数据59,492人，验证数据24,198人，测试数据25,188人。选择前10个特征的LASSO逻辑回归模型，公平性调整前：AUROC 0.84，准确率78%，敏感性72%，特异性79%，F1分数0.617。调整后：准确率81%，特异性94%，敏感性41%，F1分数0.515。

Conclusion: MASER预测模型实现了竞争性性能(AUROC 0.836，准确率77.6%)，与先前报告的集成和基于树的模型相当。可解释模型可以在不同患者群体中实现预测性能和公平性的平衡。

Abstract: Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)
affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease.
Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection
is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We
developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and
compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.
  Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and
a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including
the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates
across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity
postprocessing method.
  Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in
the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic
regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability
and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved
AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and
F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly
increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and
F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.
  Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk
Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive
performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to
previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach
demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive
performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前实验室检测依赖侵入性静脉采样且存在延迟，心电图作为非侵入性广泛可用的信号，为快速实验室估计提供了有前景的途径。

Method: 使用迁移学习方法在斯坦福MC-MED数据集上微调ECGFounder大规模预训练心电图基础模型，生成超过2000万个标准化10秒ECG片段以增强对生化相关性的敏感性。

Result: 内部验证显示，模型对33个实验室指标表现出强预测性能（AUC>0.65），对59个指标表现中等（AUC 0.55-0.65），对16个指标表现有限（AUC<0.55）。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了高效的人工智能驱动解决方案，并确立了实时、非侵入性实验室值估计的可行性范围。

Abstract: Timely access to laboratory values is critical for clinical decision-making,
yet current approaches rely on invasive venous sampling and are intrinsically
delayed. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a non-invasive and widely available
signal, offers a promising modality for rapid laboratory estimation. Recent
progress in deep learning has enabled the extraction of latent hematological
signatures from ECGs. However, existing models are constrained by low
signal-to-noise ratios, substantial inter-individual variability, limited data
diversity, and suboptimal generalization, especially when adapted to low-lead
wearable devices. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study leveraging
transfer learning to fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pre-trained ECG
foundation model, on the Multimodal Clinical Monitoring in the Emergency
Department (MC-MED) dataset from Stanford. We generated a corpus of more than
20 million standardized ten-second ECG segments to enhance sensitivity to
subtle biochemical correlates. On internal validation, the model demonstrated
strong predictive performance (area under the curve above 0.65) for
thirty-three laboratory indicators, moderate performance (between 0.55 and
0.65) for fifty-nine indicators, and limited performance (below 0.55) for
sixteen indicators. This study provides an efficient artificial-intelligence
driven solution and establishes the feasibility scope for real-time,
non-invasive estimation of laboratory values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类类比推理受限于领域专业知识和表面偏见，而LLMs拥有跨领域数据训练优势，有望在科学发现中发挥类比推理潜力

Method: 使用两种明确类比推理策略：(1)检索跨领域类比和类比引导范例来扩展探索范围；(2)从少量标记样本构建领域内类比模板来指导定向开发

Result: 这些策略产生了既定成分空间之外的候选材料，并优于标准提示基准

Conclusion: LLMs可作为可解释的、类似专家的假设生成器，利用类比驱动的泛化能力推动科学创新

Abstract: Analogical reasoning, the transfer of relational structures across contexts
(e.g., planet is to sun as electron is to nucleus), is fundamental to
scientific discovery. Yet human insight is often constrained by domain
expertise and surface-level biases, limiting access to deeper, structure-driven
analogies both within and across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast cross-domain data, present a promising yet underexplored tool
for analogical reasoning in science. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can
generate novel battery materials by (1) retrieving cross-domain analogs and
analogy-guided exemplars to steer exploration beyond conventional dopant
substitutions, and (2) constructing in-domain analogical templates from few
labeled examples to guide targeted exploitation. These explicit analogical
reasoning strategies yield candidates outside established compositional spaces
and outperform standard prompting baselines. Our findings position LLMs as
interpretable, expert-like hypothesis generators that leverage analogy-driven
generalization for scientific innovation.

TL;DR: 提出了Concept Walk框架，通过分析模型内部激活在概念方向上的演化来评估推理过程的忠实性，发现简单案例中扰动推理链会被快速忽略，而困难案例中扰动会持续影响内部激活。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维链追踪虽然承诺提供推理透明度，但并非总是忠实反映内部计算，可能导致实践者误将装饰性推理视为真实推理。

Method: Concept Walk框架在激活空间中操作，将每个推理步骤投影到从对比数据学习的概念方向上，追踪模型内部立场如何随概念方向演化。

Result: 在Qwen 3-4B模型的安全领域案例研究中，发现简单案例中扰动思维链被快速忽略，而困难案例中扰动会持续改变内部激活。

Conclusion: Concept Walk提供了通过概念特定内部动态重新审视忠实性的方法，有助于识别何时可以信任推理追踪以及何时可能误导实践者。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) traces promise transparency for reasoning language
models, but prior work shows they are not always faithful reflections of
internal computation. This raises challenges for oversight: practitioners may
misinterpret decorative reasoning as genuine. We introduce Concept Walk, a
general framework for tracing how a model's internal stance evolves with
respect to a concept direction during reasoning. Unlike surface text, Concept
Walk operates in activation space, projecting each reasoning step onto the
concept direction learned from contrastive data. This allows us to observe
whether reasoning traces shape outcomes or are discarded. As a case study, we
apply Concept Walk to the domain of Safety using Qwen 3-4B. We find that in
'easy' cases, perturbed CoTs are quickly ignored, indicating decorative
reasoning, whereas in 'hard' cases, perturbations induce sustained shifts in
internal activations, consistent with faithful reasoning. The contribution is
methodological: Concept Walk provides a lens to re-examine faithfulness through
concept-specific internal dynamics, helping identify when reasoning traces can
be trusted and when they risk misleading practitioners.

TL;DR: 提出平滑梯度上升(SGA)方法来解决LLM遗忘中的梯度上升(GA)不稳定性问题，通过在遗忘数据与构造的正常数据之间进行可调平滑，实现更稳定的遗忘同时更好保持模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度上升(GA)方法在LLM遗忘中存在严重不稳定性，导致模型效用急剧下降，需要一种更稳定的遗忘方法。

Method: SGA将遗忘数据与多个构造的正常数据通过可调平滑率结合，从仅学习遗忘数据扩展到联合学习遗忘和正常数据。

Result: 在TOFU、Harry Potter和MUSE-NEWS三个基准测试中，SGA在所有指标上均优于原始GA方法，并在多个关键指标上达到所有基线方法的前2名性能。

Conclusion: SGA通过平滑梯度上升有效解决了GA的不稳定性问题，实现了更稳定的LLM遗忘同时更好保持模型效用。

Abstract: LLM unlearning has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to enable models
to forget hazardous/undesired knowledge at low cost while preserving as much
model utility as possible. Among existing techniques, the most straightforward
method is performing Gradient Ascent (GA) w.r.t. the forget data, thereby
forcing the model to unlearn the forget dataset. However, GA suffers from
severe instability, as it drives updates in a divergent direction, often
resulting in drastically degraded model utility. To address this issue, we
propose Smoothed Gradient Ascent (SGA). SGA combines the forget data with
multiple constructed normal data through a tunable smoothing rate. Intuitively,
this extends GA from learning solely on the forget data to jointly learning
across both forget and normal data, enabling more stable unlearning while
better preserving model utility. Theoretically, we provide the theoretical
guidance on the selection of the optimal smoothing rate. Empirically, we
evaluate SGA on three benchmarks: TOFU, Harry Potter, and MUSE-NEWS.
Experimental results demonstrate that SGA consistently outperforms the original
Gradient Ascent (GA) method across all metrics and achieves top-2 performance
among all baseline methods on several key metrics.

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，该方法达到与传统dropout相当的性能，并能通过演化模式可视化网络行为

Conclusion: 生命游戏正则化在深层架构中增强不同dropout技术的性能，提供动态且可解释的正则化方案

Abstract: Regularization techniques play a crucial role in preventing overfitting and
improving the generalization performance of neural networks. Dropout, a widely
used regularization technique, randomly deactivates units during training to
introduce redundancy and prevent co-adaptation among neurons. Despite its
effectiveness, dropout has limitations, such as its static nature and lack of
interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to regularization
by substituting dropout with Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a cellular automata
with simple rules that govern the evolution of a grid of cells. We introduce
dynamic unit deactivation during training by representing neural network units
as cells in a GoL grid and applying the game's rules to deactivate units. This
approach allows for the emergence of spatial patterns that adapt to the
training data, potentially enhancing the network's ability to generalize. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing
that dynamic unit deactivation using GoL achieves comparable performance to
traditional dropout techniques while offering insights into the network's
behavior through the visualization of evolving patterns. Furthermore, our
discussion highlights the applicability of our proposal in deeper
architectures, demonstrating how it enhances the performance of different
dropout techniques.

Motivation: 在线平台用户行为不断变化导致数据漂移，使模型性能随时间下降。持续微调会引发灾难性遗忘，而传统回放方法受限于固定缓冲区大小。

Method: 在回放式持续学习框架中引入基于外部知识的数据增强策略，通过知识库扩充训练实例来克服缓冲区大小限制。

Result: 在三个异常行为分类数据集上的评估表明，增强方法优于基线回放式方法。

Conclusion: 外部知识增强能有效提升回放式持续学习在应对数据漂移和灾难性遗忘方面的性能。

Abstract: User behavior on online platforms is evolving, reflecting real-world changes
in how people post, whether it's helpful messages or hate speech. Models that
learn to capture this content can experience a decrease in performance over
time due to data drift, which can lead to ineffective behavioral analytics
systems. However, fine-tuning such a model over time with new data can be
detrimental due to catastrophic forgetting. Replay-based approaches in
continual learning offer a simple yet efficient method to update such models,
minimizing forgetting by maintaining a buffer of important training instances
from past learned tasks. However, the main limitation of this approach is the
fixed size of the buffer. External knowledge bases can be utilized to overcome
this limitation through data augmentation. We propose a novel
augmentation-based approach to incorporate external knowledge in the
replay-based continual learning framework. We evaluate several strategies with
three datasets from prior studies related to deviant behavior classification to
assess the integration of external knowledge in continual learning and
demonstrate that augmentation helps outperform baseline replay-based
approaches.

Motivation: 大多数神经网络架构仍然依赖固定、统一的激活函数，但激活函数的选择对网络性能至关重要。

Method: 第一阶段：神经元通过可微分硬混合机制从候选激活函数池（ReLU、Sigmoid、Tanh、Leaky ReLU、ELU、SELU）中自适应选择；第二阶段：根据学习到的选择固定每个神经元的激活函数。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上的评估显示，不同层的神经元表现出对激活函数的不同偏好，揭示了神经网络架构内的功能多样性。

Conclusion: SmartMixed能够有效学习每个神经元的最优激活函数，同时保持计算效率，支持继续训练和优化的向量化操作。

Abstract: The choice of activation function plays a critical role in neural networks,
yet most architectures still rely on fixed, uniform activation functions across
all neurons. We introduce SmartMixed, a two-phase training strategy that allows
networks to learn optimal per-neuron activation functions while preserving
computational efficiency at inference. In the first phase, neurons adaptively
select from a pool of candidate activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh,
Leaky ReLU, ELU, SELU) using a differentiable hard-mixture mechanism. In the
second phase, each neuron's activation function is fixed according to the
learned selection, resulting in a computationally efficient network that
supports continued training with optimized vectorized operations. We evaluate
SmartMixed on the MNIST dataset using feedforward neural networks of varying
depths. The analysis shows that neurons in different layers exhibit distinct
preferences for activation functions, providing insights into the functional
diversity within neural architectures.

Conclusion: GraphTOP是首个图拓扑导向的提示框架，通过边重连有效适应预训练GNN，在多个任务上展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of graph learning
by learning expressive graph representations from massive graph data. As a
common pattern to train powerful GNNs, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme
first pre-trains GNNs over unlabeled graph data and subsequently adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. In the adaptation phase, graph prompting is an
effective strategy that modifies input graph data with learnable prompts while
keeping pre-trained GNN models frozen. Typically, existing graph prompting
studies mainly focus on *feature-oriented* methods that apply graph prompts to
node features or hidden representations. However, these studies often achieve
suboptimal performance, as they consistently overlook the potential of
*topology-oriented* prompting, which adapts pre-trained GNNs by modifying the
graph topology. In this study, we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph
prompting in terms of graph topology. We propose the first **Graph**
**T**opology-**O**riented **P**rompting (GraphTOP) framework to effectively
adapt pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks. More specifically, we
reformulate topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within
multi-hop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space
through reparameterization while ensuring tight relaxation and preserving graph
sparsity. Extensive experiments on five graph datasets under four pre-training
strategies demonstrate that our proposed GraphTOP outshines six baselines on
multiple node classification datasets. Our code is available at

TL;DR: GradLite是一种内存高效的优化器，通过近似梯度和误差反馈技术，在大语言模型训练中减少50%的内存消耗，同时保持与Adam相当的收敛性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化器如SGD或Adam需要精确梯度，导致大语言模型全参数微调时内存消耗巨大。现有解决方案要么改变模型架构，要么以计算换内存，但优化器本身未被改进。

Method: 采用两种关键技术：1）低秩雅可比近似，降低反向传播误差信号的维度；2）误差反馈校正，累积并补偿迭代中的近似误差以保持收敛保证。

Result: 实验显示GradLite将优化器状态和激活内存消耗减少高达50%，在推理（MMLU、GSM8K）、多语言和对话基准测试中达到与检查点和优化器基线相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: GradLite通过放松对精确梯度的要求，提供了一种无需架构改变的高效训练方法，在保持收敛性能的同时显著降低内存消耗。

Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is notoriously
memory-intensive, primarily because conventional optimizers such as SGD or Adam
assume access to exact gradients derived from cached activations. Existing
solutions either alter the model architecture (e.g., reversible networks) or
trade memory for computation (e.g., activation checkpointing), but the
optimizer itself remains untouched. In this work, we introduce GradLite, a
backward-friendly optimizer that relaxes the requirement of exact gradients,
enabling efficient training even when intermediate activations are aggressively
discarded or approximated. GradLite leverages two key techniques: (i) low-rank
Jacobian approximation, which reduces the dimensionality of backpropagated
error signals, and (ii) error-feedback correction, which accumulates and
compensates approximation errors across iterations to preserve convergence
guarantees. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that GradLite maintains
unbiased gradient estimates with bounded variance, ensuring convergence rates
comparable to Adam. Empirically, GradLite reduces optimizer-state and
activation memory consumption by up to 50\% without architectural changes, and
achieves on-par or superior downstream performance on reasoning (MMLU, GSM8K),
multilingual, and dialogue benchmarks compared to checkpointing and
optimizer-centric baselines (LoMo, GaLore).

Conclusion: CORGII是首个使用离散令牌映射到高效倒排列表的密集图表示索引器，实现了更好的检索性能。

Abstract: Retrieving graphs from a large corpus, that contain a subgraph isomorphic to
a given query graph, is a core operation in many real-world applications. While
recent multi-vector graph representations and scores based on set alignment and
containment can provide accurate subgraph isomorphism tests, their use in
retrieval remains limited by their need to score corpus graphs exhaustively. We
introduce CORGII (Contextual Representation of Graphs for Inverted Indexing), a
graph indexing framework in which, starting with a contextual dense graph
representation, a differentiable discretization module computes sparse binary
codes over a learned latent vocabulary. This text document-like representation
allows us to leverage classic, highly optimized inverted indices, while
supporting soft (vector) set containment scores. Pushing this paradigm further,
we replace the classical, fixed impact weight of a `token' on a graph (such as
TFIDF or BM25) with a data-driven, trainable impact weight. Finally, we explore
token expansion to support multi-probing the index for smoother
accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. To our knowledge, CORGII is the first indexer of
dense graph representations using discrete tokens mapping to efficient inverted
lists. Extensive experiments show that CORGII provides better trade-offs
between accuracy and efficiency, compared to several baselines.

methods typically rely on large training datasets and struggle with
controllability and generalization beyond the training distributions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce LAMP (Linear Affine Mixing of
Parametric shapes), a data-efficient framework for controllable and
interpretable 3D generation. LAMP first aligns signed distance function (SDF)
decoders by overfitting each exemplar from a shared initialization, then
synthesizes new geometries by solving a parameter-constrained mixing problem in
the aligned weight space. To ensure robustness, we further propose a safety
metric that detects geometry validity via linearity mismatch. We evaluate LAMP
on two 3D parametric benchmarks: DrivAerNet++ and BlendedNet. We found that
LAMP enables (i) controlled interpolation within bounds with as few as 100
samples, (ii) safe extrapolation by up to 100% parameter difference beyond
training ranges, (iii) physics performance-guided optimization under fixed
parameters. LAMP significantly outperforms conditional autoencoder and Deep
Network Interpolation (DNI) baselines in both extrapolation and data
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LAMP advances controllable,
data-efficient, and safe 3D generation for design exploration, dataset
generation, and performance-driven optimization.

*Ren Yin,Takashi Ishida,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于互补标签的可扩展监督框架，用于评估和训练前沿AI系统，无需真实标签，利用人类专家的弱信号（指出错误选项）来估计模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在复杂任务上超越人类专家，获取高质量人类监督变得困难。人类专家通常只精通狭窄领域，无法评估超人类任务的正确性，但能提供指出错误选项的弱信号。

Method: 从互补标签推导出无偏的top-1准确率估计器，量化需要多少互补标签才能匹配普通标签的方差。引入两种估计器结合稀缺的普通标签和丰富的互补标签，并提供有限样本偏差保证。

Result: 实证表明，使用互补标签可以在没有真实标签的情况下评估大语言模型的输出，并能训练出性能更好的AI系统。

Conclusion: 通过分区人类监督，可以设计出能够在这种弱信号下更好运行的智能AI系统，为解决前沿AI系统评估和训练中的监督瓶颈提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems approach and surpass expert human
performance across a broad range of tasks, obtaining high-quality human
supervision for evaluation and training becomes increasingly challenging. Our
focus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains.
Unfortunately, even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single
narrow area, and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced AI
systems on such superhuman tasks. However, based on their narrow expertise,
humans may provide a weak signal, i.e., a complementary label indicating an
option that is incorrect. For example, a cardiologist could state that "this is
not related to cardiology,'' even if they cannot identify the true disease.
Based on this weak signal, we propose a scalable oversight framework that
enables us to evaluate frontier AI systems without the need to prepare the
ground truth. We derive an unbiased estimator of top-1 accuracy from
complementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to
match the variance of ordinary labels. We further introduce two estimators to
combine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels. We provide
finite-sample deviation guarantees for both complementary-only and the mixed
estimators. Empirically, we show that we can evaluate the output of large
language models without the ground truth, if we have complementary labels. We
further show that we can train an AI system with such weak signals: we show how
we can design an agentic AI system automatically that can perform better with
this partitioned human supervision. Our code is available at

TL;DR: LLEMA是一个将大型语言模型的科学知识与化学进化规则和基于记忆的优化相结合的材料设计框架，在14个实际任务中表现优于生成式和纯LLM基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 材料发现需要在广阔的化学和结构空间中导航，同时满足多个通常相互冲突的目标，需要一种统一的方法来加速实际材料发现。

Method: LLEMA框架在每次迭代中：LLM在明确属性约束下提出候选材料；基于代理模型的oracle估计物理化学性质；多目标评分器更新成功/失败记忆来指导后续生成。

Result: 在电子、能源、涂层、光学和航空航天等14个实际任务中，LLEMA发现的候选材料在化学合理性、热力学稳定性和属性对齐方面表现优异，比基线方法获得更高的命中率和更强的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: 通过强制执行可合成性和多目标权衡，LLEMA为加速实际材料发现提供了一条原则性路径，消融研究证实了规则引导生成、基于记忆优化和代理预测的重要性。

Abstract: Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces
while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided
Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the
scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed
evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM
proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property
constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties;
and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide
subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics,
energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are
chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving
higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only
baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation,
memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing
synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled
pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery.

TL;DR: 提出TRL算法，一种基于分治范式的值学习方法，用于离线目标条件强化学习，解决长轨迹问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对离线目标条件强化学习中的长轨迹问题，传统TD方法存在偏差累积，蒙特卡洛方法方差高，需要更高效的算法。

Method: 将GCRL中的三角不等式结构转化为实用的分治值更新规则，只需O(log T)次递归处理长度为T的轨迹。

Result: 在极具挑战性的长视野基准任务中，TRL相比之前的离线GCRL算法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: TRL通过分治方法有效解决了长轨迹强化学习中的偏差累积和高方差问题，在离线GCRL中表现优异。

Abstract: In this work, we present Transitive Reinforcement Learning (TRL), a new value
learning algorithm based on a divide-and-conquer paradigm. TRL is designed for
offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) problems, where the aim
is to find a policy that can reach any state from any other state in the
smallest number of steps. TRL converts a triangle inequality structure present
in GCRL into a practical divide-and-conquer value update rule. This has several
advantages compared to alternative value learning paradigms. Compared to
temporal difference (TD) methods, TRL suffers less from bias accumulation, as
in principle it only requires $O(\log T)$ recursions (as opposed to $O(T)$ in
TD learning) to handle a length-$T$ trajectory. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, TRL
suffers less from high variance as it performs dynamic programming.
Experimentally, we show that TRL achieves the best performance in highly
challenging, long-horizon benchmark tasks compared to previous offline GCRL
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的有符号图数据存在噪声，现有研究缺乏理论指导的鲁棒SGNN方法，需要同时处理输入空间和目标空间中的噪声问题。

Method: 扩展图信息瓶颈理论，提出RIDGE框架，通过重参数化机制和变分近似实现输入数据和监督目标的联合去噪。

Result: 在四个主流有符号图数据集上的实验表明，RIDGE显著提高了SGNN模型在不同噪声水平下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RIDGE通过理论指导的联合去噪方法，有效提升了有符号图学习在噪声环境下的鲁棒性能。

Abstract: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are widely adopted to analyze complex
patterns in signed graphs with both positive and negative links. Given the
noisy nature of real-world connections, the robustness of SGNN has also emerged
as a pivotal research area. Under the supervision of empirical properties,
graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph
representation learning, however, there remains a paucity of research
investigating a robust SGNN with theoretical guidance. Inspired by the success
of graph information bottleneck (GIB) in information extraction, we propose
RIDGE, a novel framework for Robust sI gned graph learning through joint
Denoising of Graph inputs and supervision targEts. Different from the basic
GIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as
the co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation,
RIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable
objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational
approximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed
graph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness
of popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.

TL;DR: 提出了SDC-GBB方法，通过可分解的分支定界框架解决带约束聚类问题，能够处理大规模数据集并保证全局最优性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合整数优化方法只能处理小规模数据集，限制了实用性，需要开发能够处理大规模约束聚类问题的方法

Method: 将必须链接的样本聚合成基于质心的伪样本，通过几何规则剪枝不能链接约束，结合分组样本拉格朗日分解和几何消除规则

Result: 能够处理20万样本的不能链接约束和150万样本的必须链接约束，比现有方法规模大200-1500倍，最优性差距小于3%

Conclusion: 该方法提供了确定性全局保证，避免了现成启发式方法在大数据集上的搜索失败问题

Abstract: Constrained clustering leverages limited domain knowledge to improve
clustering performance and interpretability, but incorporating pairwise
must-link and cannot-link constraints is an NP-hard challenge, making global
optimization intractable. Existing mixed-integer optimization methods are
confined to small-scale datasets, limiting their utility. We propose
Sample-Driven Constrained Group-Based Branch-and-Bound (SDC-GBB), a
decomposable branch-and-bound (BB) framework that collapses must-linked samples
into centroid-based pseudo-samples and prunes cannot-link through geometric
rules, while preserving convergence and guaranteeing global optimality. By
integrating grouped-sample Lagrangian decomposition and geometric elimination
rules for efficient lower and upper bounds, the algorithm attains highly
scalable pairwise k-Means constrained clustering via parallelism. Experimental
results show that our approach handles datasets with 200,000 samples with
cannot-link constraints and 1,500,000 samples with must-link constraints, which
is 200 - 1500 times larger than the current state-of-the-art under comparable
constraint settings, while reaching an optimality gap of less than 3%. In
providing deterministic global guarantees, our method also avoids the search
failures that off-the-shelf heuristics often encounter on large datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了随机搜索神经网络(RSNNs)来替代随机游走神经网络(RWNNs)，通过在稀疏图中仅需O(log|V|)次搜索即可实现完整边覆盖，显著提高了采样效率和图表示学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走神经网络在现实采样约束下往往无法捕获图的全局结构，因为节点和边覆盖不完整，限制了其表达能力。

Method: 提出随机搜索神经网络，每个随机搜索都保证完整的节点覆盖，并与通用序列模型配对使用。

Result: 在分子和蛋白质基准测试中，RSNNs始终优于RWNNs，在采样序列减少16倍的情况下仍能达到相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: RSNNs为稀疏图上的学习提供了一个高效且表达能力强的框架，在理论和实践层面都推进了基于随机游走的方法。

Abstract: Random walk neural networks (RWNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for
graph representation learning, leveraging recent advances in sequence models to
process random walks. However, under realistic sampling constraints, RWNNs
often fail to capture global structure even in small graphs due to incomplete
node and edge coverage, limiting their expressivity. To address this, we
propose \textit{random search neural networks} (RSNNs), which operate on random
searches, each of which guarantees full node coverage. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that in sparse graphs, only $O(\log |V|)$ searches are needed to
achieve full edge coverage, substantially reducing sampling complexity compared
to the $O(|V|)$ walks required by RWNNs (assuming walk lengths scale with graph
size). Furthermore, when paired with universal sequence models, RSNNs are
universal approximators. We lastly show RSNNs are probabilistically invariant
to graph isomorphisms, ensuring their expectation is an isomorphism-invariant
graph function. Empirically, RSNNs consistently outperform RWNNs on molecular
and protein benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior performance with up to
16$\times$ fewer sampled sequences. Our work bridges theoretical and practical
advances in random walk based approaches, offering an efficient and expressive
framework for learning on sparse graphs.

TL;DR: IsoNet++是一种早期交互图神经网络，通过跨图消息传递、惰性对齐更新和节点对交互等创新技术，显著提升了子图匹配的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的子图同构检索方法如IsoNet采用晚期交互模型，独立计算图嵌入后再进行对齐。为了更有效地进行子图匹配，需要开发早期交互模型来在嵌入计算过程中就考虑图间关系。

Method: 1) 在输入图之间进行跨图消息传递；2) 多轮惰性对齐更新，每轮基于当前对齐状态重新运行GNN；3) 引入节点对交互概念，考虑节点对而非单个节点作为潜在匹配伙伴。

Result: 实验表明对齐在多轮中逐步优化，检索性能显著优于现有方法，所有三个创新技术都对精度提升有贡献。

Conclusion: IsoNet++通过早期交互、惰性对齐更新和节点对交互的创新组合，在子图匹配任务上取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Graph retrieval based on subgraph isomorphism has several real-world
applications such as scene graph retrieval, molecular fingerprint detection and
circuit design. Roy et al. [35] proposed IsoNet, a late interaction model for
subgraph matching, which first computes the node and edge embeddings of each
graph independently of paired graph and then computes a trainable alignment
map. Here, we present IsoNet++, an early interaction graph neural network
(GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of
all nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by
an injective alignment between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in
a lazy fashion over multiple rounds. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN
from scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion
of one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments,
and proceed to the next round. Third, IsoNet++ incorporates a novel notion of
node-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention
between a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention
then controlling messages passed across graphs. In contrast, we consider node
pairs (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between
the nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for
refining the alignment. Our experiments on several datasets show that the
alignments get progressively refined with successive rounds, resulting in
significantly better retrieval performance than existing methods. We
demonstrate that all three innovations contribute to the enhanced accuracy. Our
code and datasets are publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出FAPO方法，通过识别和惩罚有缺陷的正向推理轨迹，解决RLVR训练中模型学习不可靠推理模式的问题，提升推理能力和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练中，模型会将包含答案猜测和跳跃推理等缺陷的推理轨迹与完全正确的轨迹同等奖励，导致模型内化不可靠的推理模式，限制了后期推理能力的提升。

Method: 提出FAPO方法：1) 使用生成式奖励模型(GenRM)精确检测有缺陷的正向推理轨迹；2) 对这些轨迹施加参数自由的奖励惩罚，在预热阶段利用它们作为快捷方式，在精炼阶段逐步转向可靠的推理优化。

Result: 实验表明FAPO在多个领域有效，提高了结果正确性、过程可靠性和训练稳定性，且不增加计算开销。

Conclusion: FAPO通过有意识地处理有缺陷的正向推理轨迹，实现了RLVR训练中早期能力快速提升和后期可靠推理优化的平衡，显著提升了模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). In this context, models explore reasoning trajectories and
exploit rollouts with correct answers as positive signals for policy
optimization. However, these rollouts might involve flawed patterns such as
answer-guessing and jump-in-reasoning. Such flawed-positive rollouts are
rewarded identically to fully correct ones, causing policy models to
internalize these unreliable reasoning patterns. In this work, we first conduct
a systematic study of flawed-positive rollouts in RL and find that they enable
rapid capability gains during the early optimization stage, while constraining
reasoning capability later by reinforcing unreliable patterns. Building on
these insights, we propose Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO), which
presents a parameter-free reward penalty for flawed-positive rollouts, enabling
the policy to leverage them as useful shortcuts in the warm-up stage, securing
stable early gains, while gradually shifting optimization toward reliable
reasoning in the later refinement stage. To accurately and comprehensively
detect flawed-positive rollouts, we introduce a generative reward model (GenRM)
with a process-level reward that precisely localizes reasoning errors.
Experiments show that FAPO is effective in broad domains, improving outcome
correctness, process reliability, and training stability without increasing the
token budget.

Motivation: 随着技术进步，过程日志从传统确定性来源扩展到非确定性来源（如不确定传感器或机器学习模型），这些随机已知日志包含概率信息，需要可靠的随机轨迹恢复方法来理解系统过程。

Method: 基于扩散去噪概率模型(DDPM)的深度学习方法，利用过程知识（通过隐式发现模型或显式在训练阶段注入过程知识）通过去噪来恢复轨迹。

Result: 经验评估显示达到最先进性能，比现有方法提升高达25%，在高噪声水平下具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在随机轨迹恢复任务中表现出色，特别是在处理高噪声不确定性日志时具有显著优势。

Abstract: With recent technological advances, process logs, which were traditionally
deterministic in nature, are being captured from non-deterministic sources,
such as uncertain sensors or machine learning models (that predict activities
using cameras). In the presence of stochastically-known logs, logs that contain
probabilistic information, the need for stochastic trace recovery increases, to
offer reliable means of understanding the processes that govern such systems.
We design a novel deep learning approach for stochastic trace recovery, based
on Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which makes use of process
knowledge (either implicitly by discovering a model or explicitly by injecting
process knowledge in the training phase) to recover traces by denoising. We
conduct an empirical evaluation demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with
up to a 25% improvement over existing methods, along with increased robustness
under high noise levels.

Motivation: 解决现有算法需要预知时间范围长度T的问题，避免使用性能较差的倍增技巧（需要多次重启），实现真正的任意时间算法

Result: 算法对任意t≥1实现O(√t)遗憾和Õ(√t)累积约束违反界，扩展到动态遗憾设置，并在乐观设置中提出自适应算法

Conclusion: 该方法在不需要预知时间范围长度的情况下实现了最优性能，并通过在线最短路径问题的数值实验验证了实用性

Abstract: We propose an anytime online algorithm for the problem of learning a sequence
of adversarial convex cost functions while approximately satisfying another
sequence of adversarial online convex constraints. A sequential algorithm is
called \emph{anytime} if it provides a non-trivial performance guarantee for
any intermediate timestep $t$ without requiring prior knowledge of the length
of the entire time horizon $T$. Our proposed algorithm achieves optimal
performance bounds without resorting to the standard doubling trick, which has
poor practical performance due to multiple restarts. Our core technical
contribution is the use of time-varying Lyapunov functions to keep track of
constraint violations. This must be contrasted with prior works that used a
fixed Lyapunov function tuned to the known horizon length $T$. The use of
time-varying Lyapunov function poses unique analytical challenges as
properties, such as \emph{monotonicity}, on which the prior proofs rest, no
longer hold. By introducing a new analytical technique, we show that our
algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{t})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{t})$ cumulative
constraint violation bounds for any $t\geq 1$.
  We extend our results to the dynamic regret setting, achieving bounds that
adapt to the path length of the comparator sequence without prior knowledge of
its total length. We also present an adaptive algorithm in the optimistic
setting, whose performance gracefully scales with the cumulative prediction
error. We demonstrate the practical utility of our algorithm through numerical
experiments involving the online shortest path problem.

Conclusion: 提出的在线调整插值参数方法能有效平衡标记和伪标记数据的贡献，提升半监督学习性能

Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a recently proposed statistical
inference technique for parameter estimation that leverages pseudo-labels on
both labeled and unlabeled data to construct an unbiased, low-variance
estimator. In this work, we extend its core idea to semi-supervised learning
(SSL) for model training, introducing a novel unbiased gradient estimator. This
extension addresses a key challenge in SSL: while unlabeled data can improve
model performance, its benefit heavily depends on the quality of pseudo-labels.
Inaccurate pseudo-labels can introduce bias, leading to suboptimal models.To
balance the contributions of labeled and pseudo-labeled data, we utilize an
interpolation parameter and tune it on the fly, alongside the model parameters,
using a one-dimensional online learning algorithm. We verify the practical
advantage of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets, demonstrating improved performance over classic SSL baselines and PPI
methods that tune the interpolation parameter offline.

Abstract: Geometric data analysis and learning has emerged as a distinct and rapidly
developing research area, increasingly recognized for its effectiveness across
diverse applications. At the heart of this field lies curvature, a powerful and
interpretable concept that captures intrinsic geometric structure and underpins
numerous tasks, from community detection to geometric deep learning. A wide
range of discrete curvature models have been proposed for various data
representations, including graphs, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, and
point clouds sampled from manifolds. These models not only provide efficient
characterizations of data geometry but also constitute essential components in
geometric learning frameworks. In this paper, we present the first
comprehensive review of existing discrete curvature models, covering their
mathematical foundations, computational formulations, and practical
applications in data analysis and learning. In particular, we discuss discrete
curvature from both Riemannian and metric geometry perspectives and propose a
systematic pipeline for curvature-driven data analysis. We further examine the
corresponding computational algorithms across different data representations,
offering detailed comparisons and insights. Finally, we review state-of-the-art
applications of curvature in both supervised and unsupervised learning. This
survey provides a conceptual and practical roadmap for researchers to gain a
better understanding of discrete curvature as a fundamental tool for geometric
understanding and learning.

Motivation: 现实世界中的多变量时间序列异常检测面临两个关键挑战：训练数据污染（噪声和隐藏异常）以及模型推理效率低下。现有方法假设训练数据干净，但污染会扭曲学习模式并降低检测精度，而复杂深度模型容易过拟合且延迟高。

Conclusion: CLEANet有效解决了多变量时间序列异常检测中的数据污染和效率问题，具有强泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is essential for maintaining
the reliability of industrial systems, yet real-world deployment is hindered by
two critical challenges: training data contamination (noises and hidden
anomalies) and inefficient model inference. Existing unsupervised methods
assume clean training data, but contamination distorts learned patterns and
degrades detection accuracy. Meanwhile, complex deep models often overfit to
contamination and suffer from high latency, limiting practical use. To address
these challenges, we propose CLEANet, a robust and efficient anomaly detection
framework in contaminated multivariate time series. CLEANet introduces a
Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) that mitigates the impact of
corrupted samples through an adaptive reconstruction weighting strategy
combined with clustering-guided contrastive learning, thereby enhancing
robustness. To further avoid overfitting on contaminated data and improve
computational efficiency, we design a lightweight conjugate MLP that
disentangles temporal and cross-feature dependencies. Across five public
datasets, CLEANet achieves up to 73.04% higher F1 and 81.28% lower runtime
compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating CRTF
into three advanced models yields an average 5.35% F1 gain, confirming its
strong generalizability.

TL;DR: FastVLM提出了一种基于模仿学习的自推测解码框架，通过轻量级草稿模型和完整模型的协同工作来加速视觉语言模型的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在推理过程中由于自回归解码导致计算成本高和延迟大，需要提高推理效率同时保持模型性能。

Method: 使用轻量级草稿模型进行自回归token生成，完整模型进行非自回归验证，通过模仿网络整合完整模型的深层知识来增强草稿模型。

Result: 该方法相比最终层模型将推理过程加速了1.55-1.85倍，同时保持了最小的性能损失。

Conclusion: FastVLM在效率和准确性之间实现了良好平衡，为视觉语言模型的高效推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have made significant strides in visual
understanding and query response generation, but often face challenges of high
computational cost and inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. In
this work, we introduce an imitation-learning-based Self-Speculative Decoding
(SSD) framework, named FastVLM, to address these limitations. Our approach
employs a lightweight draft model for token generation in an autoregressive
manner, while a full model verifies these tokens non-autoregressively. Accepted
tokens proceed seamlessly, while rejected tokens are corrected by the full
model and used to guide the draft model's refinement. Through an imitation
network, FastVLM enhances the draft model by integrating deeper level insights
from the full model's architecture. Also, it maintains the performance
integrity of the full model while training the draft model, achieving a balance
between efficiency and accuracy. Our method speeds up the inference process by
1.55-1.85x as compared to the final layer with minimal loss in performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved strong performance across a range
of graph representation learning tasks, yet their adversarial robustness in
graph classification remains underexplored compared to node classification.
While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work
investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness.
We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum,
average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and
identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph
structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular
Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant
singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level
representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and
interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed
pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power
iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool
provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean
accuracy. Our code is publicly available

Conclusion: 变分Polya树模型为深度学习提供了灵活的非参数贝叶斯先验，能够有效捕获潜在密度分布，并与随机梯度优化良好配合。

Abstract: Density estimation is essential for generative modeling, particularly with
the rise of modern neural networks. While existing methods capture complex data
distributions, they often lack interpretability and uncertainty quantification.
Bayesian nonparametric methods, especially the \polya tree, offer a robust
framework that addresses these issues by accurately capturing function behavior
over small intervals. Traditional techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) face high computational complexity and scalability limitations,
hindering the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods in deep learning. To tackle
this, we introduce the variational \polya tree (VPT) model, which employs
stochastic variational inference to compute posterior distributions. This model
provides a flexible, nonparametric Bayesian prior that captures latent
densities and works well with stochastic gradient optimization. We also
leverage the joint distribution likelihood for a more precise variational
posterior approximation than traditional mean-field methods. We evaluate the
model performance on both real data and images, and demonstrate its
competitiveness with other state-of-the-art deep density estimation methods. We
also explore its ability in enhancing interpretability and uncertainty
quantification. Code is available at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a spectrum of graph-related tasks, however concerns persist regarding their
vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. While prevailing defense strategies
focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing
schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of
weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs,
on a model's robustness. We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the
connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to
adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between
initial weights, number of training epochs and the model's vulnerability,
offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense
mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical
framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks.
Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets
subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate
that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean
datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations,
with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization
approaches.

Method: 提出M-LCB算法，基于UCB风格构建置信区间，直接使用实现损失，无需额外优化，反映底层专家的收敛特性

Result: 当每个专家实现内部遗憾$	ilde O(T^\alpha)$时，M-LCB确保整体遗憾为$	ilde O\!\Bigl(\sqrt{\tfrac{KT}{M}} \;+\; (K/M)^{1-\alpha}\,T^\alpha\Bigr)$

Conclusion: 这是首个在每轮预算约束下同时训练多个自适应专家并建立遗憾保证的结果，将经典赌博机范式扩展到资源有限的状态化自学习专家协调场景

Abstract: In many modern applications, a system must dynamically choose between several
adaptive learning algorithms that are trained online. Examples include model
selection in streaming environments, switching between trading strategies in
finance, and orchestrating multiple contextual bandit or reinforcement learning
agents. At each round, a learner must select one predictor among $K$ adaptive
experts to make a prediction, while being able to update at most $M \le K$ of
them under a fixed training budget.
  We address this problem in the \emph{stochastic setting} and introduce
\algname{M-LCB}, a computationally efficient UCB-style meta-algorithm that
provides \emph{anytime regret guarantees}. Its confidence intervals are built
directly from realized losses, require no additional optimization, and
seamlessly reflect the convergence properties of the underlying experts. If
each expert achieves internal regret $\tilde O(T^\alpha)$, then \algname{M-LCB}
ensures overall regret bounded by $\tilde O\!\Bigl(\sqrt{\tfrac{KT}{M}} \;+\;
(K/M)^{1-\alpha}\,T^\alpha\Bigr)$.
  To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing regret guarantees
when multiple adaptive experts are trained simultaneously under per-round
budget constraints. We illustrate the framework with two representative cases:
(i) parametric models trained online with stochastic losses, and (ii) experts
that are themselves multi-armed bandit algorithms. These examples highlight how
\algname{M-LCB} extends the classical bandit paradigm to the more realistic
scenario of coordinating stateful, self-learning experts under limited
resources.

Conclusion: 提出的基于框架投影的方法能够有效学习表示，避免了对数据增强的依赖，在时序任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on
strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse
views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations
requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational
invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we
propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces
augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete
frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete
spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced
by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the
complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves
superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through
strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine
datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific
characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without
relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance
gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches. Source code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在价值函数估计可靠性方面存在局限：多评论家集成仅组合点估计而缺乏分布信息，分布RL依赖离散化或分位数回归限制了复杂价值分布的表达能力

Method: 基于流匹配生成模型，通过建模价值分布并生成样本来进行价值估计

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明

Conclusion: 流匹配为价值估计提供了一种生成式范式，能够更好地表达复杂的价值分布

Abstract: Reliable value estimation serves as the cornerstone of reinforcement learning
(RL) by evaluating long-term returns and guiding policy improvement,
significantly influencing the convergence speed and final performance. Existing
works improve the reliability of value function estimation via multi-critic
ensembles and distributional RL, yet the former merely combines multi point
estimation without capturing distributional information, whereas the latter
relies on discretization or quantile regression, limiting the expressiveness of
complex value distributions. Inspired by flow matching's success in generative
modeling, we propose a generative paradigm for value estimation, named
FlowCritic. Departing from conventional regression for deterministic value
prediction, FlowCritic leverages flow matching to model value distributions and
generate samples for value estimation.

Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型需要准确的预测和透明的视觉证据对齐，但缺乏大规模专家级的分步推理数据集来支持视觉基础。

Method: 构建S-Chain数据集，包含结构化视觉思维链(SV-CoT)，将视觉区域与推理步骤明确关联，并用于基准测试多种医学和通用VLMs。

Conclusion: S-Chain为基于基础的医学推理建立了新基准，为更可信和可解释的医学VLMs铺平了道路。

Abstract: Faithful reasoning in medical vision-language models (VLMs) requires not only
accurate predictions but also transparent alignment between textual rationales
and visual evidence. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise
in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset
has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce
S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical
images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly
linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16
languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability.
Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med,
LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that
SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity,
and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with
retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual
grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new
mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning,
improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark
for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and
explainable medical VLMs.

Abstract: We observe that current state-of-the-art web-agents are unable to effectively
adapt to new environments without neural network fine-tuning, without which
they produce inefficient execution plans due to a lack of awareness of the

introduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action
Simulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a
model of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in
cognitive space. Our agent starts by building a "cognitive map" by performing a
lightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner
proposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in
cognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and
update the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On
the WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9%
success rate for the previously published state-of-the-art. Unlike previous

Motivation: 现有基于GP-BO的DBMS自动调优器虽然表现优于SMAC，但其基本假设在DBMS性能建模中广泛被违反，而树集成BO方法虽然能避免这些假设问题，但仍存在不确定性估计的分布假设限制。

Method: 提出Centrum自动调优器，采用两阶段随机梯度提升集成学习改进分布无关的点估计和区间估计，并采用广义SGBE估计的局部自适应保形预测实现分布无关的不确定性估计和获取函数。

Result: 在两种DBMS和三种工作负载上的大量物理和模拟实验表明，Centrum优于21种最先进的方法。

Conclusion: Centrum是首个实现分布无关性的自动调优器，增强了BO在DBMS自动调优中的实用性，也是首个将梯度提升集成和保形推理无缝融合在BO中的方法。

Abstract: Gaussian-Process-based Bayesian optimization (GP-BO), is a prevailing
model-based framework for DBMS auto-tuning. However, recent work shows
GP-BO-based DBMS auto-tuners significantly outperformed auto-tuners based on
SMAC, which features random forest surrogate models; such results motivate us
to rethink and investigate the limitations of GP-BO in auto-tuner design. We
find the fundamental assumptions of GP-BO are widely violated when modeling and
optimizing DBMS performance, while tree-ensemble-BOs (e.g., SMAC) can avoid the
assumption pitfalls and deliver improved tuning efficiency and effectiveness.
Moreover, we argue that existing tree-ensemble-BOs restrict further advancement
in DBMS auto-tuning. First, existing tree-ensemble-BOs can only achieve
distribution-free point estimates, but still impose unrealistic distributional
assumptions on uncertainty estimates, compromising surrogate modeling and
distort the acquisition function. Second, recent advances in gradient boosting,
which can further enhance surrogate modeling against vanilla GP and random
forest counterparts, have rarely been applied in optimizing DBMS auto-tuners.
To address these issues, we propose a novel model-based DBMS auto-tuner,
Centrum. Centrum improves distribution-free point and interval estimation in
surrogate modeling with a two-phase learning procedure of stochastic gradient
boosting ensembles. Moreover, Centrum adopts a generalized SGBE-estimated
locally-adaptive conformal prediction to facilitate a distribution-free
uncertainty estimation and acquisition function. To our knowledge, Centrum is
the first auto-tuner to realize distribution-freeness, enhancing BO's
practicality in DBMS auto-tuning, and the first to seamlessly fuse gradient
boosting ensembles and conformal inference in BO. Extensive physical and
simulation experiments on two DBMSs and three workloads show Centrum
outperforms 21 SOTA methods.

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的模糊集设计为分布鲁棒优化提供了有效的解决方案，显著提升了模型在分布外场景下的泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper studies Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), a fundamental
framework for enhancing the robustness and generalization of statistical
learning and optimization. An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve
distributions that remain consistent with the nominal distribution while being
diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it
should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose a
diffusion-based ambiguity set design that captures various adversarial
distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency
with the nominal distribution. Building on this ambiguity modeling, we propose
Diffusion-based DRO (D-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner
maximization over the parameterized diffusion model space. We formally
establish the stationary convergence performance of D-DRO and empirically
demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance
in a ML prediction task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在修剪Transformer层时通常需要重新训练，且不能保证任务性能的提升。Tale旨在通过直接优化任务特定性能来实现无重训练的层修剪。

Method: Tale在推理时根据任务特定验证性能直接修剪整个Transformer层，支持零样本和少样本设置，并在微调过程中应用以获得额外性能提升。

Result: 在9个任务和5个模型上的评估显示，Tale在所有基准测试中一致提高准确性并减少计算成本，同时提供精度与效率之间的灵活权衡控制。

Conclusion: Tale通过选择性层移除解决了某些层作为瓶颈的问题，产生更小、更快、更准确的模型，并为Transformer可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Tale, Task-Aware Layer Elimination, an
inference-time algorithm that prunes entire transformer layers in an LLM by
directly optimizing task-specific validation performance. We evaluate TALE on 9
tasks and 5 models, including LLaMA 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 2.5 0.5B, Mistral
7B, and Lucie 7B, under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Unlike prior
approaches, TALE requires no retraining and consistently improves accuracy
while reducing computational cost across all benchmarks. Furthermore, applying
TALE during finetuning leads to additional performance gains. Finally, TALE
provides flexible user control over trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.
Mutual information analysis shows that certain layers act as bottlenecks,
degrading task-relevant representations. Tale's selective layer removal
remedies this problem, producing smaller, faster, and more accurate models that
are also faster to fine-tune while offering new insights into transformer
interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出了SeeDNorm动态归一化方法，通过基于当前输入动态调整缩放系数来增强模型表示能力，在保持RMSNorm优点的同时解决了其丢弃输入范数信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMSNorm归一化层丢弃了输入范数信息，且静态缩放因子难以适应输入数据的广泛变化和分布偏移，特别是在大语言模型的零样本场景中限制了性能提升。

Method: SeeDNorm通过动态调整缩放系数来保留输入范数信息，实现数据依赖的自重缩放动态归一化，在反向传播中保持RMSNorm根据输入范数动态调整梯度的能力。

Result: 在不同规模的大语言模型预训练以及监督和无监督计算机视觉任务中，SeeDNorm相比RMSNorm、LayerNorm和DyT等方法都取得了持续优越的性能，仅引入少量参数且对模型效率影响可忽略。

Conclusion: SeeDNorm通过动态缩放机制有效解决了现有归一化方法的局限性，在多种任务中表现出色，为归一化层设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Normalization layer constitutes an essential component in neural networks. In
transformers, the predominantly used RMSNorm constrains vectors to a unit
hypersphere, followed by dimension-wise rescaling through a learnable scaling
coefficient $\gamma$ to maintain the representational capacity of the model.
However, RMSNorm discards the input norm information in forward pass and a
static scaling factor $\gamma$ may be insufficient to accommodate the wide
variability of input data and distributional shifts, thereby limiting further
performance improvements, particularly in zero-shot scenarios that large
language models routinely encounter. To address this limitation, we propose
SeeDNorm, which enhances the representational capability of the model by
dynamically adjusting the scaling coefficient based on the current input,
thereby preserving the input norm information and enabling data-dependent,
self-rescaled dynamic normalization. During backpropagation, SeeDNorm retains
the ability of RMSNorm to dynamically adjust gradient according to the input
norm. We provide a detailed analysis of the training optimization for SeedNorm
and proposed corresponding solutions to address potential instability issues
that may arise when applying SeeDNorm. We validate the effectiveness of
SeeDNorm across models of varying sizes in large language model pre-training as
well as supervised and unsupervised computer vision tasks. By introducing a

TL;DR: NBF-Rec是一种基于图的推荐模型，支持在用户和物品集不相交的数据集之间进行归纳迁移学习，无需为每个领域重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于图的推荐系统通常在转导设置下训练，限制了其对新用户、新物品或新数据集的适用性。

Method: NBF-Rec在推理时动态计算节点嵌入，使用交互级消息传递，支持零样本设置和轻量级微调。

Result: 在七个真实世界数据集上的评估显示，NBF-Rec在零样本设置下达到竞争性性能，并通过轻量级微调获得进一步改进。

Conclusion: 基于图的推荐中的归纳迁移是可行的，交互级消息传递支持跨数据集的泛化，无需对齐用户或物品。

Abstract: Graph-based recommender systems are commonly trained in transductive
settings, which limits their applicability to new users, items, or datasets. We
propose NBF-Rec, a graph-based recommendation model that supports inductive
transfer learning across datasets with disjoint user and item sets. Unlike
conventional embedding-based methods that require retraining for each domain,
NBF-Rec computes node embeddings dynamically at inference time. We evaluate the
method on seven real-world datasets spanning movies, music, e-commerce, and
location check-ins. NBF-Rec achieves competitive performance in zero-shot
settings, where no target domain data is used for training, and demonstrates
further improvements through lightweight fine-tuning. These results show that
inductive transfer is feasible in graph-based recommendation and that
interaction-level message passing supports generalization across datasets
without requiring aligned users or items.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于分布式多智能体多臂老虎机问题的算法，该问题考虑异构奖励和随机通信图，实现了对数级别的遗憾上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在随机通信图下的分布式多智能体多臂老虎机问题，其中每个智能体对同一臂的奖励分布可能不同，且通信图随时间随机变化，目标是设计高效的分布式算法以最小化累积遗憾。

Method: 提出了一种完全分布式算法，结合了臂消除策略和随机gossip算法，通过随机通信图进行信息交换。

Result: 理论分析表明遗憾上界为O(log T)，包含集中式最优遗憾项和反映通信效率影响的附加项，该附加项与图的代数连通性和链路概率相关。

Conclusion: 该算法在随机通信图下实现了高效的分布式学习，揭示了通信效率与遗憾之间的基本权衡关系，数值实验验证了理论结果的优越性。

Abstract: We study the distributed multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with
heterogeneous rewards over random communication graphs. Uniquely, at each time
step $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by
applying the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for
classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each
potential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link
probability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily
connected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant
distributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across
agents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the
global mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean
rewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed
algorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip
algorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\log
T$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the
optimal centralized regret $O\left(\sum_{k: \Delta_k>0} \frac{\log
T}{\Delta_k}\right)$ and an additional term $O\left(\frac{N^2 \log T}{p
\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \frac{KN^2 \log T}{p}\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote
the total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the
impact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link
probability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between
communication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal
regret lower bound. Finally, our numerical experiments not only show the
superiority of our algorithm over existing benchmarks, but also validate the
theoretical regret scaling with problem complexity.

*Soham Pahari,Sandeep Chand Kumain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LOESS分解、ARIMA建模和多尺度CNN-BiLSTM网络的混合预测框架，用于印度大城市的空气质量指数预测，在多个污染物上实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度大城市空气污染严重，污染物水平突然飙升挑战及时干预，准确预测AQI因线性趋势、季节变化和波动非线性模式共存而困难。

Method: 使用LOESS将AQI序列分解为趋势、季节和残差分量，ARIMA建模平滑分量，提出的深度学习模块捕捉残差中的多尺度波动，通过UAMMO优化器调整超参数。

Result: 在2021-2023年AQI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有污染物上均优于统计、深度学习和混合基线方法，MSE降低5-8%，R²得分>0.94。

Conclusion: 该框架具有鲁棒性，对突发污染事件敏感，适用于城市空气质量管理的实际应用。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical environmental and public health concern in
Indian megacities such as Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, where sudden spikes in
pollutant levels challenge timely intervention. Accurate Air Quality Index
(AQI) forecasting is difficult due to the coexistence of linear trends,
seasonal variations, and volatile nonlinear patterns. This paper proposes a
hybrid forecasting framework that integrates LOESS decomposition, ARIMA
modeling, and a multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM network with a residual-gated attention
mechanism. The LOESS step separates the AQI series into trend, seasonal, and
residual components, with ARIMA modeling the smooth components and the proposed
deep learning module capturing multi-scale volatility in the residuals. Model
hyperparameters are tuned via the Unified Adaptive Multi-Stage Metaheuristic
Optimizer (UAMMO), combining multiple optimization strategies for efficient
convergence. Experiments on 2021-2023 AQI datasets from the Central Pollution
Control Board show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
statistical, deep learning, and hybrid baselines across PM2.5, O3, CO, and NOx
in three major cities, achieving up to 5-8% lower MSE and higher R^2 scores
(>0.94) for all pollutants. These results demonstrate the framework's
robustness, sensitivity to sudden pollution events, and applicability to urban
air quality management.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了BOBW FTRL算法在赌博机问题中的末轮收敛率，证明了使用1/2-Tsallis-INF正则化器时，最优臂与算法在迭代t时获得的臂分布之间的Bregman散度以t^{-1/2}的速率衰减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习算法的末轮收敛分析在机器学习理论中很重要，但在多臂赌博机问题中，大多数现有分析主要关注遗憾阶数，而末轮收敛率研究较少，特别是对于广泛研究的FTRL算法。

Method: 通过理论分析研究BOBW FTRL算法（特别是1/2-Tsallis-INF算法）的末轮收敛性质，使用由正则函数Ψ(p)=-4∑√p_i定义的Bregman散度作为收敛度量。

Result: 证明了Bregman散度（在最优臂的点质量和算法在迭代t时获得的臂分布之间）以t^{-1/2}的速率衰减，部分证实了对数遗憾应该对应t^{-1}末轮收敛率的直觉。

Conclusion: 该工作部分证实了对数遗憾与t^{-1}末轮收敛率相关的直觉，为BOBW FTRL算法在赌博机问题中的末轮收敛性质提供了理论分析基础。

Abstract: The convergence analysis of online learning algorithms is central to machine
learning theory, where last-iterate convergence is particularly important, as
it captures the learner's actual decisions and describes the evolution of the
learning process over time. However, in multi-armed bandits, most existing
algorithmic analyses mainly focus on the order of regret, while the
last-iterate (simple regret) convergence rate remains less explored --
especially for the widely studied Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)
algorithms. Recently, a growing line of work has established the
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) property of FTRL algorithms in bandit problems,
showing in particular that they achieve logarithmic regret in stochastic
bandits. Nevertheless, their last-iterate convergence rate has not yet been
studied. Intuitively, logarithmic regret should correspond to a $t^{-1}$
last-iterate convergence rate. This paper partially confirms this intuition
through theoretical analysis, showing that the Bregman divergence, defined by
the regular function $\Psi(p)=-4\sum_{i=1}^{d}\sqrt{p_i}$ associated with the
BOBW FTRL algorithm $1/2$-Tsallis-INF (arXiv:1807.07623), between the point
mass on the optimal arm and the probability distribution over the arm set
obtained at iteration $t$, decays at a rate of $t^{-1/2}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合GAN的不可区分性保证和逻辑解释能力，在有限逻辑深度预算下实现可解释的样本生成和验证。

Method: 使用深度k的EF游戏框架，判别器作为对手搜索可读的故障，生成器作为构建者产生与目标理论T在k轮匹配的样本。

Result: 仿真验证达到92%-98%属性满足度，真实神经网络GAN训练在挑战性属性上提升5%-14%，连通性达到98%满足度。

Conclusion: LOGAN提供了一个紧凑、可复现的逻辑有界生成路径，具有可解释的失败、经过验证的有效性以及可控参数。

Abstract: GANs promise indistinguishability, logic explains it. We put the two on a
budget: a discriminator that can only ``see'' up to a logical depth $k$, and a
generator that must look correct to that bounded observer. \textbf{LOGAN}
(LOGical GANs) casts the discriminator as a depth-$k$ Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e
(EF) \emph{Opponent} that searches for small, legible faults (odd cycles,
nonplanar crossings, directed bridges), while the generator plays
\emph{Builder}, producing samples that admit a $k$-round matching to a target
theory $T$. We ship a minimal toolkit -- an EF-probe simulator and MSO-style
graph checkers -- and four experiments including real neural GAN training with
PyTorch. Beyond verification, we score samples with a \emph{logical loss} that
mixes budgeted EF round-resilience with cheap certificate terms, enabling a
practical curriculum on depth. Framework validation demonstrates $92\%$--$98\%$
property satisfaction via simulation (Exp.~3), while real neural GAN training
achieves $5\%$--$14\%$ improvements on challenging properties and $98\%$
satisfaction on connectivity (matching simulation) through adversarial learning
(Exp.~4). LOGAN is a compact, reproducible path toward logic-bounded generation
with interpretable failures, proven effectiveness (both simulated and real
training), and dials for control.

Motivation: 现有离散扩散模型使用仅解码器架构，需要在每个去噪步骤调用完整网络，计算成本高

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，编码器表示干净token，轻量级解码器迭代精炼噪声序列，并支持块扩散模型的快速训练

Result: 在摘要、翻译和数学推理任务上实现了生成质量和推理吞吐量之间的优越权衡

Conclusion: E2D2框架通过专门的架构和算法显著提升了离散扩散模型的推理效率

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models enable parallel token sampling for faster inference
than autoregressive approaches. However, prior diffusion models use a
decoder-only architecture, which requires sampling algorithms that invoke the
full network at every denoising step and incur high computational cost. Our key
insight is that discrete diffusion models perform two types of computation: 1)
representing clean tokens and 2) denoising corrupted tokens, which enables us
to use separate modules for each task. We propose an encoder-decoder
architecture to accelerate discrete diffusion inference, which relies on an
encoder to represent clean tokens and a lightweight decoder to iteratively
refine a noised sequence. We also show that this architecture enables faster
training of block diffusion models, which partition sequences into blocks for
better quality and are commonly used in diffusion language model inference. We
introduce a framework for Efficient Encoder-Decoder Diffusion (E2D2),
consisting of an architecture with specialized training and sampling
algorithms, and we show that E2D2 achieves superior trade-offs between
generation quality and inference throughput on summarization, translation, and
mathematical reasoning tasks. We provide the code, model weights, and blog post

Abstract: Precipitation prediction has undergone a profound transformation -- from
early symbolic and empirical methods rooted in divination and observation, to
modern technologies based on atmospheric physics and artificial intelligence.
This review traces the historical and technological evolution of precipitation
forecasting, presenting a survey about end-to-end precipitation prediction
technologies that spans ancient practices, the foundations of meteorological
science, the rise of numerical weather prediction (NWP), and the emergence of
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. We first explore
traditional and indigenous forecasting methods, then describe the development
of physical modeling and statistical frameworks that underpin contemporary
operational forecasting. Particular emphasis is placed on recent advances in
neural network-based approaches, including automated deep learning,
interpretability-driven design, and hybrid physical-data models. By compositing
research across multiple eras and paradigms, this review not only depicts the
history of end-to-end precipitation prediction but also outlines future
directions in next generation forecasting systems.

TL;DR: RLPD-GX是一个混合离线-在线强化学习框架，通过将策略优化与安全执行解耦来解决分布偏移问题：奖励寻求学习器自由探索，而基于投影的守护器保证规则一致执行和安全值备份。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合离线-在线强化学习(O2O RL)结合了样本效率和鲁棒探索的优势，但由于离线数据和在线数据之间的分布偏移而存在不稳定性问题。

Method: 提出RLPD-GX框架，将策略优化与安全执行解耦：奖励寻求学习器自由探索，基于投影的守护器保证安全执行；采用动态课程学习，逐步扩展时间视野并退火离线-在线数据混合。

Result: 在Atari-100k上实现了3.02的归一化平均分数，比先前的混合方法提高了45%，在安全性和稳定性方面表现更强；在其他安全关键和长视野任务上也显示出一致的优势。

Conclusion: 解耦的安全执行为鲁棒O2O RL提供了一条简单而有原则的路径，为强化学习中探索与安全的协调提供了更广泛的范式。

Abstract: Hybrid offline--online reinforcement learning (O2O RL) promises both sample
efficiency and robust exploration, but suffers from instability due to
distribution shift between offline and online data. We introduce RLPD-GX, a
framework that decouples policy optimization from safety enforcement: a
reward-seeking learner explores freely, while a projection-based guardian
guarantees rule-consistent execution and safe value backups. This design
preserves the exploratory value of online interactions without collapsing to
conservative policies. To further stabilize training, we propose dynamic
curricula that gradually extend temporal horizons and anneal offline--online
data mixing. We prove convergence via a contraction property of the guarded
Bellman operator, and empirically show state-of-the-art performance on
Atari-100k, achieving a normalized mean score of 3.02 (+45\% over prior hybrid
methods) with stronger safety and stability. Beyond Atari, ablations
demonstrate consistent gains across safety-critical and long-horizon tasks,
underscoring the generality of our design. Extensive and comprehensive results
highlight decoupled safety enforcement as a simple yet principled route to
robust O2O RL, suggesting a broader paradigm for reconciling exploration and
safety in reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在48小时后预测稳定性不足，特别是在监测网络稀疏的城市中，难以满足公共卫生预警系统的长期预测需求

Method: 结合动态时间规整进行智能站点相似性选择，使用轻量级CNN-GRU架构增强气象特征，针对稀疏网络优化的可扩展设计

Conclusion: 该框架计算效率高且无需外部工具，特别适合资源受限的城市环境部署，满足了关键预警系统需求

Abstract: Reliable long-term forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations is critical for public
health early-warning systems, yet existing deep learning approaches struggle to
maintain prediction stability beyond 48 hours, especially in cities with sparse
monitoring networks. This paper presents a deep learning framework that
combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for intelligent station similarity
selection with a CNN-GRU architecture to enable extended-horizon PM2.5
forecasting in Isfahan, Iran, a city characterized by complex pollution
dynamics and limited monitoring coverage. Unlike existing approaches that rely
on computationally intensive transformer models or external simulation tools,
our method integrates three key innovations: (i) DTW-based historical sampling
to identify similar pollution patterns across peer stations, (ii) a lightweight
CNN-GRU architecture augmented with meteorological features, and (iii) a
scalable design optimized for sparse networks. Experimental validation using
multi-year hourly data from eight monitoring stations demonstrates superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods, achieving R2 =
0.91 for 24-hour forecasts. Notably, this is the first study to demonstrate
stable 10-day PM2.5 forecasting (R2 = 0.73 at 240 hours) without performance
degradation, addressing critical early-warning system requirements. The
framework's computational efficiency and independence from external tools make
it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained urban
environments.

Motivation: 验证基础模型在临床表型发现中的适用性，防止产生表面真实但临床不连贯的嵌入表示。

Method: 训练两个自回归模型（LSTM和简化Transformer）于HIV和急性低血压数据集，添加随机访问间隔控制不规则性，评估患者轨迹合成的分布和相关性保真度。

Result: 两个模型都能复制特征分布，但都未能保持跨特征结构，显示生成预训练产生局部真实性但临床连贯性有限。

Conclusion: 需要领域特定的评估方法，轨迹合成可作为微调或部署前的实用探针。

Abstract: Foundation models refer to architectures trained on vast datasets using
autoregressive pre-training from natural language processing to capture
intricate patterns and motifs. They were originally developed to transfer such
learned knowledge to downstream predictive tasks. Recently, however, some
studies repurpose these learned representations for phenotype discovery without
rigorous validation, risking superficially realistic but clinically incoherent
embeddings. To test this mismatch, we trained two autoregressive models -- a
sequence-to-sequence LSTM and a reduced Transformer -- on longitudinal ART for
HIV and Acute Hypotension datasets. Controlled irregularity was added during
training via random inter-visit gaps, while test sequences stayed complete.
Patient-trajectory synthesis evaluated distributional and correlational
fidelity. Both reproduced feature distributions but failed to preserve
cross-feature structure -- showing that generative pre-training yields local
realism but limited clinical coherence. These results highlight the need for
domain-specific evaluation and support trajectory synthesis as a practical
probe before fine-tuning or deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法通过客户端嵌入控制有效解决了多模态联邦学习中的数据不对齐问题，并通过理论分析和实证结果验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning in real-world settings often encounters
incomplete and heterogeneous data across clients. This results in misaligned
local feature representations that limit the effectiveness of model
aggregation. Unlike prior work that assumes either differing modality sets
without missing input features or a shared modality set with missing features
across clients, we consider a more general and realistic setting where each
client observes a different subset of modalities and might also have missing
input features within each modality. To address the resulting misalignment in
learned representations, we propose a new federated learning framework
featuring locally adaptive representations based on learnable client-side
embedding controls that encode each client's data-missing patterns.
  These embeddings serve as reconfiguration signals that align the globally
aggregated representation with each client's local context, enabling more
effective use of shared information. Furthermore, the embedding controls can be
algorithmically aggregated across clients with similar data-missing patterns to
enhance the robustness of reconfiguration signals in adapting the global
representation. Empirical results on multiple federated multimodal benchmarks
with diverse data-missing patterns across clients demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed method, achieving up to 36.45\% performance improvement under
severe data incompleteness. The method is also supported by a theoretical
analysis with an explicit performance bound that matches our empirical
observations. Our source codes are provided at

Motivation: 传统的RLHF方法复杂且不稳定，需要简化对齐过程并提高稳定性。

Method: 基于最大边际似然估计的偏好优化方法，使用偏好对作为样本近似，隐式执行偏好优化。

Result: 在135M到8B参数的模型上，MMPO在超参数稳定性、偏好对齐效果和基础能力保持方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MMPO提供了一种更简单稳定的对齐方法，能有效优化偏好对齐同时保持模型基础能力。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial, but
standard methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are
often complex and unstable. In this work, we propose a new, simpler approach
that recasts alignment through the lens of Maximum Marginal Likelihood (MML)
estimation. Our new MML based Preference Optimization (MMPO) maximizes the
marginal log-likelihood of a preferred text output, using the preference pair
as samples for approximation, and forgoes the need for both an explicit reward
model and entropy maximization. We theoretically demonstrate that MMPO
implicitly performs preference optimization, producing a weighted gradient that
naturally up-weights chosen responses over rejected ones. Across models ranging
from 135M to 8B parameters, we empirically show that MMPO: 1) is more stable
with respect to the hyperparameter $\beta$ compared to alternative baselines,
and 2) achieves competitive or superior preference alignment while better
preserving the base model's general language capabilities. Through a series of
ablation experiments, we show that this improved performance is indeed
attributable to MMPO's implicit preference optimization within the gradient
updates.

Abstract: Linguistic Landscape (LL) research traditionally relies on manual photography
and annotation of public signages to examine distribution of languages in urban
space. While such methods yield valuable findings, the process is
time-consuming and difficult for large study areas. This study explores the use
of AI powered language detection method to automate LL analysis. Using Honolulu
Chinatown as a case study, we constructed a georeferenced photo dataset of
1,449 images collected by researchers and applied AI for optical character
recognition (OCR) and language classification. We also conducted manual
validations for accuracy checking. This model achieved an overall accuracy of
79%. Five recurring types of mislabeling were identified, including distortion,
reflection, degraded surface, graffiti, and hallucination. The analysis also
reveals that the AI model treats all regions of an image equally, detecting
peripheral or background texts that human interpreters typically ignore.
Despite these limitations, the results demonstrate the potential of integrating
AI-assisted workflows into LL research to reduce such time-consuming processes.
However, due to all the limitations and mis-labels, we recognize that AI cannot
be fully trusted during this process. This paper encourages a hybrid approach
combining AI automation with human validation for a more reliable and efficient
workflow.

daily life and incur considerable global economic losses. The emergence of
next-generation small-satellites, capable of constellation-based operations,
offers unparalleled opportunities for near-real-time monitoring and onboard
processing of such events. However, a major bottleneck remains the lack of
extensive annotated datasets capturing volcanic activity, which hinders the
development of robust detection systems. This paper introduces a novel dataset
explicitly designed for volcanic activity and eruption detection, encompassing
diverse volcanoes worldwide. The dataset provides binary annotations to
identify volcanic anomalies or non-anomalies, covering phenomena such as
temperature anomalies, eruptions, and volcanic ash emissions. These annotations
offer a foundational resource for developing and evaluating detection models,
addressing a critical gap in volcanic monitoring research. Additionally, we
present comprehensive benchmarks using state-of-the-art models to establish
baselines for future studies. Furthermore, we explore the potential for
deploying these models onboard next-generation satellites. Using the Intel
Movidius Myriad X VPU as a testbed, we demonstrate the feasibility of volcanic
activity detection directly onboard. This capability significantly reduces
latency and enhances response times, paving the way for advanced early warning
systems. This paves the way for innovative solutions in volcanic disaster
management, encouraging further exploration and refinement of onboard
monitoring technologies.

Abstract: Subgraph matching is vital in knowledge graph (KG) question answering,
molecule design, scene graph, code and circuit search, etc. Neural methods have
shown promising results for subgraph matching. Our study of recent systems
suggests refactoring them into a unified design space for graph matching
networks. Existing methods occupy only a few isolated patches in this space,
which remains largely uncharted. We undertake the first comprehensive
exploration of this space, featuring such axes as attention-based vs. soft
permutation-based interaction between query and corpus graphs, aligning nodes
vs. edges, and the form of the final scoring network that integrates neural
representations of the graphs. Our extensive experiments reveal that judicious
and hitherto-unexplored combinations of choices in this space lead to large
performance benefits. Beyond better performance, our study uncovers valuable
insights and establishes general design principles for neural graph
representation and interaction, which may be of wider interest.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简化的去噪损失函数用于均匀状态扩散模型，通过仅优化噪声替换的token来稳定训练，并引入对比学习启发的负梯度来进一步提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的掩码扩散语言模型在少步生成时性能下降，且无法直接应用为连续扩散模型设计的少步蒸馏方法。均匀状态扩散模型虽然缓解了部分限制，但其复杂的损失函数阻碍了可扩展性。

Method: 提出简化的去噪损失函数，仅优化噪声替换的token；将去噪重构为自监督学习，引入对比学习启发的负梯度机制。

Result: 简化损失函数稳定了训练过程，达到了ELBO级别的性能；对比学习启发的负梯度方法进一步提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been extended to language generation through
Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), which achieve performance competitive
with strong autoregressive models. However, MDLMs tend to degrade in the
few-step regime and cannot directly adopt existing few-step distillation
methods designed for continuous diffusion models, as they lack the intrinsic
property of mapping from noise to data. Recent Uniform-state Diffusion Models
(USDMs), initialized from a uniform prior, alleviate some limitations but still
suffer from complex loss formulations that hinder scalability. In this work, we
propose a simplified denoising-based loss for USDMs that optimizes only
noise-replaced tokens, stabilizing training and matching ELBO-level
performance. Furthermore, by framing denoising as self-supervised learning, we
introduce a simple modification to our denoising loss with contrastive-inspired
negative gradients, which is practical and yield additional improvements in
generation quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Diffuse to Detect (DTD)框架，通过单步扩散过程预测噪声模式，实现快速精确的异常检测，避免了重建误差。结合图神经网络建模传感器关系，能有效捕捉时空异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂高维数据（如无人机传感器读数）中的异常检测对操作安全至关重要，但现有方法在敏感性、可扩展性和捕捉复杂依赖关系方面存在局限。

Method: DTD框架创新性地将扩散模型用于异常检测，采用单步扩散过程预测噪声模式。结合图神经网络建模传感器关系为动态图，采用双分支架构（参数化神经网络能量评分和非参数统计方法）。

Result: 在无人机传感器数据、多元时间序列和图像上的广泛评估表明，DTD性能优于现有方法，在不同数据模态上具有通用性。

Conclusion: DTD的通用性和适应性使其成为安全关键应用（包括工业监控等）的变革性解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor
readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing
methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture
intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a
novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection,
diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference
time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict
noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without
reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical
foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score
function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural
Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively
captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch
architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for
scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability,
provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency.
Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images
demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its
generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its
adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical
applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.

Motivation: 持续学习对LLMs适应知识增长至关重要，但缺乏统计可靠性保证，特别是在持续领域预训练场景下，传统共形预测面临分布偏移和预测集过大的挑战。

Method: 使用基于transformer的聚类估计测试集中问题的域分布，重新加权或重采样校准数据，并结合自适应拒绝机制让LLM在置信度或能力显著变化时选择弃答。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应拒绝和非交换共形预测框架成功解决了持续领域预训练中LLMs的统计可靠性问题，为自进化LLMs提供了有效的可靠性保证。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is essential for enabling self-evolving large
language models (LLMs) to adapt and remain effective amid rapid knowledge
growth. Yet, despite its importance, little attention has been given to
establishing statistical reliability guarantees for LLMs under CL, particularly
in the setting of continual domain pretraining (CDP). Conformal Prediction (CP)
has shown promise in offering correctness guarantees for LLMs, but it faces
major challenges in CDP: testing data often stems from unknown or shifting
domain distributions, under which CP may no longer provide valid guarantees.
Moreover, when high coverage is required, CP can yield excessively large
prediction sets for unanswerable queries, reducing informativeness. To address
these challenges, we introduce an adaptive rejection and non-exchangeable CP
framework. Our method first estimates the distribution of questions across
domains in the test set using transformer-based clustering, then reweights or
resamples the calibration data accordingly. Building on this, adaptive
rejection CP allows the LLM to selectively abstain from answering when its
confidence or competence shifts significantly. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework enhances both the effectiveness and reliability
of CP under CDP scenarios. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辅助学习需要人工标注辅助任务，这需要人力和领域专业知识。现有元学习方法使用双层优化，但计算成本高且代码复杂。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，RL代理为每个训练数据点选择辅助标签，当选择改善主任务性能时获得奖励。还实验了学习每个数据点的辅助损失权重策略。

Result: 在20-Superclass CIFAR100问题上，RL方法超越人工标注辅助任务，与主要双层优化技术表现相当。权重学习方法显著超越所有基准，VGG16架构达到80.9%测试准确率。

Conclusion: 证明了RL是动态生成辅助任务的可行方法，并且可以同时学习辅助任务标签和每个样本的权重，获得强大结果。

Abstract: Auxiliary Learning (AL) is a special case of Multi-task Learning (MTL) in
which a network trains on auxiliary tasks to improve performance on its main
task. This technique is used to improve generalization and, ultimately,
performance on the network's main task. AL has been demonstrated to improve
performance across multiple domains, including navigation, image
classification, and natural language processing. One weakness of AL is the need
for labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain
expertise to generate. Meta Learning techniques have been used to solve this
issue by learning an additional auxiliary task generation network that can
create helpful tasks for the primary network. The most prominent techniques
rely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased
code complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an
RL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an
RL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a
training set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the
performance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal
strategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass
CIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and
performs as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight
learning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For
example, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve
80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved
75.53%. The goal of this work is to (1) prove that RL is a viable approach to
dynamically generate auxiliary tasks and (2) demonstrate that per-sample
auxiliary task weights can be learned alongside the auxiliary task labels and
can achieve strong results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种灾害响应数字孪生(H-RDT)系统，结合物理信息神经网络、多模态数据融合和公平意识风险分析，用于城市级灾害响应。在模拟的野火-停电-热浪连锁灾害中，该系统能维持稳定的室内温度预测，并通过强化学习自适应调整物联网、无人机和卫星输入权重，识别高脆弱性区域。前瞻性干预措施可降低热风险11-13%，尾部风险7-17%，过热时间最多减少9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复合气候灾害（如野火引发的停电和城市热浪）对城市稳定性和公平性构成挑战，需要开发能够整合物理灾害建模与社会公平的决策支持系统。

Method: 结合物理信息神经网络建模、多模态数据融合和公平意识风险分析，构建灾害响应数字孪生系统。使用强化学习模块自适应重加权物联网、无人机和卫星输入，维持时空覆盖。

Result: 在模拟灾害场景中，H-RDT在部分传感器损失情况下仍能维持稳定的室内温度预测（约31-33°C），再现停电驱动的温度激增和恢复过程。公平调整映射识别出高脆弱性集群（学校、诊所、低收入住房）。前瞻性干预措施降低人口加权热风险11-13%，尾部风险7-17%，过热时间最多减少9%。

Conclusion: H-RDT为实际城市实施建立了可转移的基础，将物理灾害建模与社会公平和决策智能联系起来，推动数字城市韧性向自适应、基于学习且以公平为中心的决策支持发展。

Abstract: Compounding climate hazards, such as wildfire-induced outages and urban
heatwaves, challenge the stability and equity of cities. We present a
Hazard-Responsive Digital Twin (H-RDT) that combines physics-informed neural
network modeling, multimodal data fusion, and equity-aware risk analytics for
urban-scale response. In a synthetic district with diverse building archetypes
and populations, a simulated wildfire-outage-heatwave cascade shows that H-RDT
maintains stable indoor temperature predictions (approximately 31 to 33 C)
under partial sensor loss, reproducing outage-driven surges and recovery. The
reinforcement learning based fusion module adaptively reweights IoT, UAV, and
satellite inputs to sustain spatiotemporal coverage, while the equity-adjusted
mapping isolates high-vulnerability clusters (schools, clinics, low-income
housing). Prospective interventions, such as preemptive cooling-center
activation and microgrid sharing, reduce population-weighted thermal risk by 11
to 13 percent, shrink the 95th-percentile (tail) risk by 7 to 17 percent, and
cut overheating hours by up to 9 percent. Beyond the synthetic demonstration,
the framework establishes a transferable foundation for real-city
implementation, linking physical hazard modeling with social equity and
decision intelligence. The H-RDT advances digital urban resilience toward
adaptive, learning-based, and equity-centered decision support for climate
adaptation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过汉克尔奇异值正则化来压缩状态空间模型的方法，使模型在保持高精度的同时实现高达10倍的压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于状态空间模型的深度神经网络在长序列任务中表现良好，但训练后压缩困难。为了解决这个问题，研究者希望通过正则化汉克尔奇异值来获得可压缩的模型。

Method: 开发了一种高效计算汉克尔奇异值的算法，利用状态空间模型参数化中系统矩阵的块对角结构，在训练迭代过程中实现可扩展的正则化。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中，正则化的状态空间层比标准状态空间层压缩率高10倍，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: 汉克尔奇异值正则化是压缩状态空间模型的有效方法，能够在不显著牺牲性能的情况下大幅提升模型压缩效率。

Abstract: Deep neural networks using state space models as layers are well suited for
long-range sequence tasks but can be challenging to compress after training. We
use that regularizing the sum of Hankel singular values of state space models
leads to a fast decay of these singular values and thus to compressible models.
To make the proposed Hankel singular value regularization scalable, we develop
an algorithm to efficiently compute the Hankel singular values during training
iterations by exploiting the specific block-diagonal structure of the system
matrices that is we use in our state space model parametrization. Experiments
on Long Range Arena benchmarks demonstrate that the regularized state space
layers are up to 10$\times$ more compressible than standard state space layers
while maintaining high accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SARNet是一种用于剩余使用寿命预测的尖峰感知连续验证框架，结合现代时间卷积网络和自适应阈值检测，提供物理可解释性，在多个基准数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前剩余使用寿命预测模型在故障起始点附近表现脆弱，对工程师不透明：短时高能尖峰被平滑或误读，固定阈值降低灵敏度，缺乏基于物理的解释。

Method: 基于现代时间卷积网络预测退化敏感指标，通过自适应连续阈值验证真实尖峰并抑制噪声，对易故障段进行针对性特征工程，最后使用堆叠RF-LGBM回归器生成最终RUL预测。

Result: 在事件触发协议下的基准数据集上，SARNet相比近期基线模型持续降低误差（RMSE 0.0365，MAE 0.0204），同时保持轻量、鲁棒且易于部署。

Conclusion: SARNet通过尖峰感知检测和物理信息可解释性，有效解决了现有RUL预测模型在故障起始点附近的脆弱性和不透明问题，实现了准确且可解释的剩余使用寿命预测。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is essential to enhance
system reliability and reduce maintenance risk. Yet many strong contemporary
models are fragile around fault onset and opaque to engineers: short,
high-energy spikes are smoothed away or misread, fixed thresholds blunt
sensitivity, and physics-based explanations are scarce. To remedy this, we
introduce SARNet (Spike-Aware Consecutive Validation Framework), which builds
on a Modern Temporal Convolutional Network (ModernTCN) and adds spike-aware
detection to provide physics-informed interpretability. ModernTCN forecasts
degradation-sensitive indicators; an adaptive consecutive threshold validates
true spikes while suppressing noise. Failure-prone segments then receive
targeted feature engineering (spectral slopes, statistical derivatives, energy
ratios), and the final RUL is produced by a stacked RF--LGBM regressor. Across
benchmark-ported datasets under an event-triggered protocol, SARNet
consistently lowers error compared to recent baselines (RMSE 0.0365, MAE
0.0204) while remaining lightweight, robust, and easy to deploy.

TL;DR: 研究发现增强大语言模型的推理能力会因果性地增加工具幻觉，这种效应与训练方法无关，且缓解策略会带来可靠性-能力权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有观察表明更强的推理能力往往伴随着更多幻觉，但缺乏系统性研究来验证推理增强是否直接导致工具幻觉。

Method: 构建SimpleToolHalluBench诊断基准，通过控制实验测试推理增强对工具幻觉的影响，并评估不同缓解策略。

Result: 证实推理增强与工具幻觉存在因果关系，这种效应超越过拟合，且在不同推理增强方法中普遍存在。缓解策略显示可靠性-能力权衡。

Conclusion: 当前推理增强方法固有地放大工具幻觉，需要开发能同时优化能力和可靠性的新训练目标。

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key
strategy for building Agents that "think then act." However, recent
observations, like OpenAI's o3, suggest a paradox: stronger reasoning often
coincides with increased hallucination, yet no prior work has systematically
examined whether reasoning enhancement itself causes tool hallucination. To
address this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning
increase tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,
a diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)
no tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled
experiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal
relationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool
hallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect
transcends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still
amplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,
appearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is
merely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step
thinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering
and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental
reliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades
utility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses
tool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as
amplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams. These
findings reveal that current reasoning enhancement methods inherently amplify
tool hallucination, highlighting the need for new training objectives that
jointly optimize for capability and reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络服务数量激增导致相似服务选择困难，现有QoS预测方法难以捕捉丰富上下文信息，在极端数据稀疏和结构噪声下性能不佳

Method: 集成多阶注意力机制聚合上下文数据，使用对抗神经网络进行自回归监督学习，采用Gumbel-Softmax离散采样技术生成负样本

Result: 在大规模真实数据集上的实验验证表明，该模型显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: QoSMGAA模型在服务选择和推荐场景中具有强大的实际部署潜力

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of internet technologies, network services have
become critical for delivering diverse and reliable applications to users.
However, the exponential growth in the number of available services has
resulted in many similar offerings, posing significant challenges in selecting
optimal services. Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) accurately thus becomes a
fundamental prerequisite for ensuring reliability and user satisfaction.
However, existing QoS prediction methods often fail to capture rich contextual
information and exhibit poor performance under extreme data sparsity and
structural noise. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture, QoSMGAA,
specifically designed to enhance prediction accuracy in complex and noisy
network service environments. QoSMGAA integrates a multi-order attention
mechanism to aggregate extensive contextual data and predict missing QoS values
effectively. Additionally, our method incorporates adversarial neural networks
to perform autoregressive supervised learning based on transformed interaction
matrices. To capture complex, higher-order interactions among users and
services, we employ a discrete sampling technique leveraging the Gumbel-Softmax
method to generate informative negative samples. Comprehensive experimental
validation conducted on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrates that our
proposed model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods,
highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment in service selection
and recommendation scenarios.

Motivation: 现有等变模型大多局限于旋转等简单对称性，无法处理科学领域中常见的更广泛的一般线性变换GL(n)，需要开发能够处理这类更复杂对称性的神经网络架构。

Method: 引入Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs)，采用伴随不变双线性层设计，能够稳定地对李代数特征和矩阵值输入保持等变性，无需为每个子群重新设计。

Conclusion: ReLNs为在李代数和矩阵值数据上学习广泛线性群对称性提供了一个实用且通用的框架。

Abstract: Encoding symmetries is a powerful inductive bias for improving the
generalization of deep neural networks. However, most existing equivariant
models are limited to simple symmetries like rotations, failing to address the
broader class of general linear transformations, GL(n), that appear in many
scientific domains. We introduce Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), a novel neural
network architecture exactly equivariant to these general linear symmetries.
ReLNs are designed to operate directly on a wide range of structured inputs,
including general n-by-n matrices. ReLNs introduce a novel adjoint-invariant
bilinear layer to achieve stable equivariance for both Lie-algebraic features
and matrix-valued inputs, without requiring redesign for each subgroup. This
architecture overcomes the limitations of prior equivariant networks that only
apply to compact groups or simple vector data. We validate ReLNs' versatility
across a spectrum of tasks: they outperform existing methods on algebraic
benchmarks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries and achieve competitive results on a
Lorentz-equivariant particle physics task. In 3D drone state estimation with
geometric uncertainty, ReLNs jointly process velocities and covariances,
yielding significant improvements in trajectory accuracy. ReLNs provide a
practical and general framework for learning with broad linear group symmetries
on Lie algebras and matrix-valued data. Project page:

Motivation: 研究语言模型在上下文示例中组合基本技能以完成复合任务的能力，这在技能及其组合无法在训练中学习的情况下更具挑战性。

Method: 对多个开源语言模型进行系统实验，使用语言和逻辑任务来探测组合能力，并通过理论分析验证示例与组合步骤对齐的重要性。

Result: 实验结果显示简单任务示例对性能有负面影响，模型难以正确识别和组合技能，即使使用思维链示例也无明显改善。

Conclusion: 示例与组合步骤的对齐至关重要，基于此洞察提出的改进方法在探测任务中表现更好，为研究提供了积极支持。

Abstract: Composing basic skills from simple tasks to accomplish composite tasks is
crucial for modern intelligent systems. We investigate the in-context
composition ability of language models to perform composite tasks that combine
basic skills demonstrated in in-context examples. This is more challenging than
the standard setting, where skills and their composition can be learned in
training. We conduct systematic experiments on various representative
open-source language models, utilizing linguistic and logical tasks designed to
probe composition abilities. The results reveal that simple task examples can
have a surprising negative impact on the performance, because the models
generally struggle to recognize and assemble the skills correctly, even with
Chain-of-Thought examples. Theoretical analysis further shows that it is
crucial to align examples with the corresponding steps in the composition. This
inspires a method for the probing tasks, whose improved performance provides
positive support for our insights.

*Pravin Nair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数（p≥1）下具有统一的Lipschitz常数1/2，比传统认为的1更小，这直接改进了现有关于鲁棒性和收敛性的理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型和优化算法的鲁棒性保证与收敛性分析通常假设softmax算子的Lipschitz常数为1，但这一假设可能不够精确，限制了理论分析的紧致性。

Method: 通过理论分析证明softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数下的Lipschitz常数均为1/2，并针对不同p值分析局部Lipschitz常数的变化规律。

Result: 证明了softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数（p≥1）下具有统一的Lipschitz常数1/2，对于p=1和p=∞，局部Lipschitz常数达到1/2，对于p∈(1,∞)，局部常数严格小于1/2且上确界为1/2。

Conclusion: 这是首次对softmax Lipschitz连续性进行的全面范数统一分析，更精确的Lipschitz常数直接改进了现有关于鲁棒性和收敛性的理论结果，并通过在注意力架构和强化学习中的实证研究验证了1/2常数的尖锐性。

Abstract: The softmax function is a basic operator in machine learning and
optimization, used in classification, attention mechanisms, reinforcement
learning, game theory, and problems involving log-sum-exp terms. Existing
robustness guarantees of learning models and convergence analysis of
optimization algorithms typically consider the softmax operator to have a
Lipschitz constant of $1$ with respect to the $\ell_2$ norm. In this work, we
prove that the softmax function is contractive with the Lipschitz constant
$1/2$, uniformly across all $\ell_p$ norms with $p \ge 1$. We also show that
the local Lipschitz constant of softmax attains $1/2$ for $p = 1$ and $p =
\infty$, and for $p \in (1,\infty)$, the constant remains strictly below $1/2$
and the supremum $1/2$ is achieved only in the limit. To our knowledge, this is
the first comprehensive norm-uniform analysis of softmax Lipschitz continuity.
We demonstrate how the sharper constant directly improves a range of existing
theoretical results on robustness and convergence. We further validate the
sharpness of the $1/2$ Lipschitz constant of the softmax operator through
empirical studies on attention-based architectures (ViT, GPT-2, Qwen3-8B) and

*Han Wu,Jie Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoEMeta是一个用于少样本知识图谱关系学习的元学习框架，通过解耦全局共享知识和任务特定上下文，结合混合专家模型和任务定制适应机制，显著提升了少样本关系推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本知识图谱关系学习方法存在两个关键问题：一是孤立学习关系元知识，未能捕捉跨任务共享的关系模式；二是难以有效整合对快速适应至关重要的局部任务特定上下文。

Method: 提出MoEMeta框架，包含两个关键创新：(1)混合专家模型学习全局共享关系原型以增强泛化能力；(2)任务定制适应机制捕捉局部上下文实现快速任务特定适应。

Result: 在三个知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验和分析表明，MoEMeta始终优于现有基线方法，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 通过平衡全局泛化与局部适应性，MoEMeta显著推进了少样本关系学习的发展，为解决现有方法的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph relational learning seeks to perform reasoning over
relations given only a limited number of training examples. While existing
approaches largely adopt a meta-learning framework for enabling fast adaptation
to new relations, they suffer from two key pitfalls. First, they learn relation
meta-knowledge in isolation, failing to capture common relational patterns
shared across tasks. Second, they struggle to effectively incorporate local,
task-specific contexts crucial for rapid adaptation. To address these
limitations, we propose MoEMeta, a novel meta-learning framework that
disentangles globally shared knowledge from task-specific contexts to enable
both effective generalization and rapid adaptation. MoEMeta introduces two key
innovations: (i) a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that learns globally shared
relational prototypes to enhance generalization, and (ii) a task-tailored
adaptation mechanism that captures local contexts for fast task-specific
adaptation. By balancing global generalization with local adaptability, MoEMeta
significantly advances few-shot relational learning. Extensive experiments and
analyses on three KG benchmarks demonstrate that MoEMeta consistently
outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sentinel是一个用于物联网入侵检测的个性化联邦学习框架，通过双模型架构（个性化教师模型和轻量级共享学生模型）解决类别不平衡、非IID数据和通信开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习方法在物联网入侵检测中面临类别不平衡、非IID数据分布和高通信开销的挑战，导致性能下降。

Method: 采用双模型架构，结合双向知识蒸馏、多层面特征对齐和类别平衡损失函数，服务器使用标准化梯度聚合确保公平性。

Result: 在IoTID20和5GNIDD数据集上的实验表明，Sentinel在极端数据异构条件下显著优于现有联邦学习方法，同时保持通信效率。

Conclusion: Sentinel为物联网入侵检测提供了一个高效、隐私保护的联邦学习解决方案，在数据异构环境中建立了新的性能基准。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for machine
learning, but its application in intrusion detection systems (IDS) within IoT
networks is challenged by severe class imbalance, non-IID data, and high
communication overhead.These challenges severely degrade the performance of
conventional FL methods in real-world network traffic classification. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Sentinel, a personalized federated IDS
(pFed-IDS) framework that incorporates a dual-model architecture on each
client, consisting of a personalized teacher and a lightweight shared student
model. This design effectively balances deep local adaptation with efficient
global model consensus while preserving client privacy by transmitting only the
compact student model, thus reducing communication costs. Sentinel integrates
three key mechanisms to ensure robust performance: bidirectional knowledge
distillation with adaptive temperature scaling, multi-faceted feature
alignment, and class-balanced loss functions. Furthermore, the server employs
normalized gradient aggregation with equal client weighting to enhance fairness
and mitigate client drift. Extensive experiments on the IoTID20 and 5GNIDD
benchmark datasets demonstrate that Sentinel significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art federated methods, establishing a new performance benchmark,
especially under extreme data heterogeneity, while maintaining communication
efficiency.

Method: 设计了一种路由器感知的重要性采样权重优化方法，采用基于路由器logits的重新缩放策略。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著改善了MoE模型的收敛稳定性和最终性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为MoE架构量身定制的RL算法创新提供了有前景的方向，有助于大规模专家模型的高效训练。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have substantially improved
the training of large-scale language models, leading to significant gains in
generation quality and reasoning ability. However, most existing research
focuses on dense models, while RL training for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures remains underexplored. To address the instability commonly
observed in MoE training, we propose a novel router-aware approach to optimize
importance sampling (IS) weights in off-policy RL. Specifically, we design a
rescaling strategy guided by router logits, which effectively reduces gradient
variance and mitigates training divergence. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves both the convergence stability and the
final performance of MoE models, highlighting the potential of RL algorithmic
innovations tailored to MoE architectures and providing a promising direction
for efficient training of large-scale expert models.

TL;DR: CrysLLMGen是一个混合框架，结合了LLM和扩散模型的优势来生成周期性晶体结构，在多个基准任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法存在互补缺陷：LLM擅长处理离散原子类型但难以处理连续特征，而扩散模型擅长连续变量但难以生成准确原子组成。需要结合两者优势。

Method: 首先使用微调LLM生成原子类型、坐标和晶格结构的中间表示，保留原子类型预测，将坐标和晶格结构传递给预训练等变扩散模型进行细化。

Result: 在多个基准任务和数据集上优于最先进生成模型，实现了结构和组成有效性的平衡性能，生成了更稳定和新的材料，并展示了强大的条件生成能力。

Conclusion: CrysLLMGen成功整合了LLM和扩散模型的互补优势，为晶体材料生成提供了有效的混合框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have shown significant promise in
designing novel periodic crystal structures. Existing approaches typically rely
on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each
with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but
often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice
parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous
variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic
compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework
that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary
strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first
employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom
types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted
atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a
pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks
and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance
in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more
stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models
Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities,
effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints. Code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调和两种看似不同的策略梯度优化方法（直接REINFORCE风格方法和优势塑造技术），揭示它们在可验证奖励强化学习中的内在联系。

Method: 通过逆向工程分析现有优势塑造算法，发现它们隐式优化代理奖励；同时从代理奖励目标出发，提供推导优势塑造方法的简单方法。

Result: 证明了两种方法是同一枚硬币的两面，优势塑造方法实际上是对奖励层面的正则化，特别是将GRPO的硬样本加权修改解释为奖励正则化。

Conclusion: 这种视角为RLVR策略梯度优化提供了超越Pass@K原始动机的通用框架，能够推导出新的优势塑造方法。

Abstract: This note reconciles two seemingly distinct approaches to policy gradient
optimization for the Pass@K objective in reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards: (1) direct REINFORCE-style methods, and (2) advantage-shaping
techniques that directly modify GRPO. We show that these are two sides of the
same coin. By reverse-engineering existing advantage-shaping algorithms, we
reveal that they implicitly optimize surrogate rewards. We specifically
interpret practical ``hard-example up-weighting'' modifications to GRPO as
reward-level regularization. Conversely, starting from surrogate reward
objectives, we provide a simple recipe for deriving both existing and new
advantage-shaping methods. This perspective provides a lens for RLVR policy
gradient optimization beyond our original motivation of Pass@K.

Abstract: Pre-trained models exhibit strong generalization to various downstream tasks.
However, given the numerous models available in the model hub, identifying the
most suitable one by individually fine-tuning is time-consuming. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{SwiftTS}, a swift selection framework for time series
pre-trained models. To avoid expensive forward propagation through all
candidates, SwiftTS adopts a learning-guided approach that leverages historical
dataset-model performance pairs across diverse horizons to predict model
performance on unseen datasets. It employs a lightweight dual-encoder
architecture that embeds time series and candidate models with rich
characteristics, computing patchwise compatibility scores between data and
model embeddings for efficient selection. To further enhance the generalization
across datasets and horizons, we introduce a horizon-adaptive expert
composition module that dynamically adjusts expert weights, and the
transferable cross-task learning with cross-dataset and cross-horizon task
sampling to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Extensive experiments
on 14 downstream datasets and 8 pre-trained models demonstrate that SwiftTS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series pre-trained model
selection.

Abstract: Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative Mobile Edge Computing
(MEC) systems face critical challenges in coordinating trajectory planning,
task offloading, and resource allocation while ensuring Quality of Service
(QoS) under dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing approaches suffer from
limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among
UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with
stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated
graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer
dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal
dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships
and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop
a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous
trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a
reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with
gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust
knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2%
IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%.
Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers,
IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical
applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.

Motivation: 解决在离散状态空间上从未归一化密度中采样的挑战，避免需要目标分布样本或计算配分函数，这对于统计物理等领域的问题具有重要意义。

Method: 基于前向均匀扩散核的连续时间马尔可夫链，利用目标具体分数恒等式将具体分数与玻尔兹曼因子的期望比值关联，通过神经网络近似具体分数，提出了自归一化和无偏两种TCSIS算法。

Conclusion: TCSIS提供了一种有效的离散状态空间采样方法，通过反向CTMC动力学学习，无需目标分布样本或配分函数计算，在统计物理应用中表现出良好性能。

Abstract: We introduce the Target Concrete Score Identity Sampler (TCSIS), a method for
sampling from unnormalized densities on discrete state spaces by learning the
reverse dynamics of a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC). Our approach builds
on a forward in time CTMC with a uniform noising kernel and relies on the
proposed Target Concrete Score Identity, which relates the concrete score, the
ratio of marginal probabilities of two states, to a ratio of expectations of
Boltzmann factors under the forward uniform diffusion kernel. This formulation
enables Monte Carlo estimation of the concrete score without requiring samples
from the target distribution or computation of the partition function. We
approximate the concrete score with a neural network and propose two
algorithms: Self-Normalized TCSIS and Unbiased TCSIS. Finally, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of TCSIS on problems from statistical physics.

Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即神经网络算子的精度受限于训练数据的保真度，探索神经网络如何通过训练超越其训练数据的精度限制。

Method: 理论分析结合经验验证，研究归纳偏置、训练目标和数值误差特性之间的相互作用，使用标准神经网络架构在不同PDE上进行测试。

Result: 发现神经网络模拟器能够隐式学习比训练数据更正则化的动力学，具有更有利的误差累积特性，从而在某些操作机制下超越训练数据的物理保真度。

Conclusion: 需要重新评估模拟器基准测试，神经网络模拟器在特定操作机制下可能达到比训练源更高的物理保真度。

Abstract: Neural operators or emulators for PDEs trained on data from numerical solvers
are conventionally assumed to be limited by their training data's fidelity. We
challenge this assumption by identifying "emulator superiority," where neural
networks trained purely on low-fidelity solver data can achieve higher accuracy
than those solvers when evaluated against a higher-fidelity reference. Our
theoretical analysis reveals how the interplay between emulator inductive
biases, training objectives, and numerical error characteristics enables
superior performance during multi-step rollouts. We empirically validate this
finding across different PDEs using standard neural architectures,
demonstrating that emulators can implicitly learn dynamics that are more
regularized or exhibit more favorable error accumulation properties than their
training data, potentially surpassing training data limitations and mitigating
numerical artifacts. This work prompts a re-evaluation of emulator
benchmarking, suggesting neural emulators might achieve greater physical
fidelity than their training source within specific operational regimes.

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are gaining attention for their
ability to embed physical laws into deep learning models, which is particularly
useful in structural engineering tasks with limited data. This paper aims to
explore the use of PINNs to predict the weight of small scale spaghetti
bridges, a task relevant to understanding load limits and potential failure
modes in simplified structural models. Our proposed framework incorporates
physics-based constraints to the prediction model for improved performance. In
addition to standard PINNs, we introduce a novel architecture named Physics
Informed Kolmogorov Arnold Network (PIKAN), which blends universal function
approximation theory with physical insights. The structural parameters provided
as input to the model are collected either manually or through computer vision
methods. Our dataset includes 15 real bridges, augmented to 100 samples, and
our best model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.9603 and a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 10.50 units. From applied perspective, we also provide a web based
interface for parameter entry and prediction. These results show that PINNs can
offer reliable estimates of structural weight, even with limited data, and may
help inform early stage failure analysis in lightweight bridge designs.

Abstract: Outlier detection is an important problem occurring in a wide range of areas.
Outliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human
error, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform
outlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers
and build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier
detection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal
outlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier
detection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of
domain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed
to represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify
outliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an
advantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are
founded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been
evaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from
two different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying
balance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a
neurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate
the proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in
terms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal
is useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false
positive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.

Motivation: 为理解GSPO算法中序列级权重$s(\theta) = (\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$的本质，建立其与信息论量之间的联系，从而更好地解释算法的经验特性。

Method: 通过数学推导证明GSPO的序列级权重等价于困惑度比率$\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$和指数交叉熵变化$\exp(\Delta H)$，并在数学推理任务上进行控制实验验证。

Result: 成功建立了GSPO重要性权重与信息论量之间的数学等价关系，验证了该视角能够解释GSPO的经验特性，包括通过几何平均实现的log域方差减少和在专家混合模型训练中的稳定性。

Conclusion: 信息论视角为理解GSPO算法提供了新的洞见，表明该算法通过困惑度比率加权策略梯度更新，这一解释有助于理解算法的实际表现和稳定性。

Abstract: We provide a new perspective on GSPO's length-normalized importance ratios by
establishing their connection to information-theoretic quantities. We show that
GSPO's sequence-level weight $s(\theta) =
(\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$ can be equivalently expressed
as the inverse perplexity ratio
$\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$ and as the exponential
cross-entropy change $\exp(\Delta H)$. While the perplexity-entropy
relationship follows from standard definitions, this observation provides a
useful lens for understanding GSPO: the algorithm weights policy gradient
updates by perplexity ratios, offering an information-theoretic interpretation
of the importance weights. This perspective helps explain GSPO's empirical
properties, including log-domain variance reduction through geometric averaging
and stability in training mixture-of-experts models. We validate the
mathematical equivalences and variance predictions through controlled
experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构将感知与决策分离，导致策略失败无法直接帮助感知模块学习重要内容，这种分离效率低下

Method: 实现感知-决策交错Transformer架构，在Transformer中交替感知和决策层，并集成受CLIP启发的对比损失来对齐文本任务嵌入与视觉场景特征

Result: 在BabyAI GoToLocal环境中，该方法实现了更稳定的奖励和更强的对齐效果，优于标准PPO基线

Conclusion: 交错Transformer编码器是开发更集成自主代理的有前景方向

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents often struggle when tasks require
understanding both vision and language. Conventional architectures typically
isolate perception (for example, CNN-based visual encoders) from
decision-making (policy networks). This separation can be inefficient, since
the policy's failures do not directly help the perception module learn what is
important. To address this, we implement the Perception-Decision Interleaving
Transformer (PDiT) architecture introduced by Mao et al. (2023), a model that
alternates between perception and decision layers within a single transformer.
This interleaving allows feedback from decision-making to refine perceptual
features dynamically. In addition, we integrate a contrastive loss inspired by
CLIP to align textual mission embeddings with visual scene features. We
evaluate the PDiT encoders on the BabyAI GoToLocal environment and find that
the approach achieves more stable rewards and stronger alignment compared to a
standard PPO baseline. The results suggest that interleaved transformer
encoders are a promising direction for developing more integrated autonomous
agents.

Motivation: 现有振动手势识别方法依赖复杂预处理和大规模神经网络，需要高性能硬件，导致高能耗和部署困难。需要开发能在低功耗设备上运行的能效解决方案。

Method: 采用原始波形输入替代复杂频谱预处理；设计两种轻量级架构（1D-CNN和1D-SepCNN）；使用整数量化和自动RTL生成；扩展硬件感知搜索框架支持约束驱动模型选择。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持竞争力的准确率同时，显著降低了计算复杂度和能耗，证明适合长期边缘部署，为智能家居手势识别提供了可行的低功耗解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for smart home interfaces has increased interest in
non-intrusive sensing methods like vibration-based gesture recognition. While
prior studies demonstrated feasibility, they often rely on complex
preprocessing and large Neural Networks (NNs) requiring costly high-performance
hardware, resulting in high energy usage and limited real-world deployability.
This study proposes an energy-efficient solution deploying compact NNs on
low-power Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to enable real-time gesture
recognition with competitive accuracy. We adopt a series of optimizations: (1)
We replace complex spectral preprocessing with raw waveform input, eliminating
complex on-board preprocessing while reducing input size by 21x without
sacrificing accuracy. (2) We design two lightweight architectures (1D-CNN and
1D-SepCNN) tailored for embedded FPGAs, reducing parameters from 369 million to
as few as 216 while maintaining comparable accuracy. (3) With integer-only
quantization and automated RTL generation, we achieve seamless FPGA deployment.
A ping-pong buffering mechanism in 1D-SepCNN further improves deployability
under tight memory constraints. (4) We extend a hardware-aware search framework
to support constraint-driven model configuration selection, considering
accuracy, deployability, latency, and energy consumption. Evaluated on two
swipe-direction datasets with multiple users and ordinary tables, our approach
achieves low-latency, energy-efficient inference on the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S25
FPGA. Under the PS data splitting setting, the selected 6-bit 1D-CNN reaches

*Etienne Goffinet,Shane Bergsma,Avraham Sheinin,Natalia Vassilieva,Shaheer Muhammad,Preslav Nakov,Gurpreet Gosal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PTPP感知的适应缩放定律，将预训练预算作为显式变量，能够准确预测未见PTPP值下的适应损失，并在多语言设置中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续预训练缩放定律通常假设固定的预训练预算，这限制了它们预测在不同tokens-per-parameter(PTPP)下训练的模型适应结果的能力。

Method: 开发PTPP感知的适应缩放定律，使预训练预算成为显式变量，并在多语言设置（英语/阿拉伯语→法语）上进行验证。

Result: 在PTPP={15,31}的早期阶段训练的PTPP感知公式能够准确预测PTPP=279时的目标损失，并在各项指标上优于PTPP不可知的DCPT传输基线。

Conclusion: PTPP感知缩放定律不仅能准确预测适应损失，还具有实际应用价值，可在计算限制下规划重放比例和适应token预算以满足目标和遗忘约束。

Abstract: Continual pre-training (CPT) for domain adaptation must balance target-domain
gains with stability on the base domain. Existing CPT scaling laws typically
assume a fixed pre-training budget, which limits their ability to forecast
adaptation outcomes for models trained at different tokens-per-parameter
(PTPP). We present \emph{PTPP-aware} adaptation scaling laws that make the
pre-training budget an explicit variable, enabling accurate \emph{prediction}
of adaptation loss at unseen \ptpp. On a multilingual setup (English/Arabic
$\rightarrow$ French), PTPP-aware formulations trained on early stages
(\ptpp{}=\{15,31\}) predict target loss at \ptpp{}=279 and outperform a
PTPP-agnostic \dcpt{} transfer baseline on metrics (Huber-on-log,
MAE$_\mathrm{rel}$, calibration slope); full diagnostics (RMSE, MAPE) are in
the appendix. Beyond forecasting, we show a practical use case: planning replay
ratios and adaptation token budgets that satisfy target and forgetting
constraints under compute limits.

*Amal Abed,Ivan Lukic,Jörg K. H. Franke,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个可扩展的合成数据生成管道，创建了近80万个包含指令-推理-代码-测试的四元组数据集，用于提升LLM的代码生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成数据集大多只包含问题与解决方案，缺乏指导编码的中间推理过程，限制了LLM在代码生成方面的进展。

Method: 结合四个关键组件：精选竞赛问题、相关性分类器筛选的网络内容、基于推理模式的数据扩展、多阶段执行验证，并使用遗传变异算法增加任务多样性。

Result: 在该数据集上微调LLM能在编码基准测试中取得一致改进，推理感知数据可以替代模型扩展，在不同架构间泛化，并在相同样本预算下优于领先的开源替代方案。

Conclusion: 以推理为中心的合成数据生成是提升LLM编码能力的高效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive promise in code
generation, yet their progress remains limited by the shortage of large-scale
datasets that are both diverse and well-aligned with human reasoning. Most
existing resources pair problems with solutions, but omit the intermediate
thought process that guides coding. To close this gap, we present a scalable
synthetic data generation pipeline that produces nearly 800k
instruction-reasoning-code-test quadruplets. Each sample combines a task, a
step-by-step reasoning trace, a working solution, and executable tests,
enabling models to learn not just the what but also the how of problem solving.
Our pipeline combines four key components: curated contest problems, web-mined
content filtered by relevance classifiers, data expansion guided by reasoning
patterns, and multi-stage execution-based validation. A genetic mutation
algorithm further increases task diversity while maintaining consistency
between reasoning traces and code implementations. Our key finding is that
fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset yields consistent improvements on coding
benchmarks. Beyond raw accuracy, reasoning-aware data can substitute for model
scaling, generalize across architectures, and outperform leading open-source
alternatives under identical sample budgets. Our work establishes
reasoning-centered synthetic data generation as an efficient approach for
advancing coding capabilities in LLMs. We publish our dataset and generation
pipeline to facilitate further research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SCSF的新方法，通过利用算子之间的相似性来加速特征值数据生成，相比传统数值求解器可获得3.5倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络特征值方法需要大量带标签数据（算子和特征值）进行训练，但数据生成过程计算成本高昂。现有方法忽略了算子之间的相似性这一重要因素。

Method: 使用截断快速傅里叶变换排序将具有相似特征值分布的算子分组，构建切比雪夫子空间滤波器，利用先前已求解问题的特征对来辅助求解后续问题，减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验结果显示，SCSF相比各种数值求解器实现了最高3.5倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: SCSF是首个加速特征值数据生成的方法，通过利用算子相似性显著提高了数据生成效率。

Abstract: Eigenvalue problems are among the most important topics in many scientific
disciplines. With the recent surge and development of machine learning, neural
eigenvalue methods have attracted significant attention as a forward pass of
inference requires only a tiny fraction of the computation time compared to
traditional solvers. However, a key limitation is the requirement for large
amounts of labeled data in training, including operators and their eigenvalues.
To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Sorting Chebyshev
Subspace Filter (SCSF), which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data
generation by leveraging similarities between operators -- a factor overlooked
by existing methods. Specifically, SCSF employs truncated fast Fourier
transform sorting to group operators with similar eigenvalue distributions and
constructs a Chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from
previously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones, reducing
redundant computations. To the best of our knowledge, SCSF is the first method
to accelerate eigenvalue data generation. Experimental results show that SCSF
achieves up to a $3.5\times$ speedup compared to various numerical solvers.

*Félix Chavelli,Paul Boniol,Michaël Thomazo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的时间序列分割评估指标WARI和SMS，解决了现有指标在捕捉分割质量、错误类型和可解释性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割评估方法主要关注变化点准确性或使用基于点的度量（如ARI），无法充分评估分割段的质量、忽略错误性质且可解释性有限。

Method: 引入WARI（加权调整兰德指数）考虑分割错误的位置，以及SMS（状态匹配分数）这种细粒度度量，能够识别和评分四种基本分割错误类型并支持错误特定加权。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中验证了WARI和SMS的有效性，表明它们不仅提供更准确的分割质量评估，还能揭示传统指标无法获取的错误来源和类型等洞察。

Conclusion: WARI和SMS为时间序列分割提供了更全面、可解释的评估框架，能够更好地理解分割算法的性能特征和错误模式。

Abstract: Time series segmentation is a fundamental task in analyzing temporal data
across various domains, from human activity recognition to energy monitoring.
While numerous state-of-the-art methods have been developed to tackle this
problem, the evaluation of their performance remains critically limited.
Existing measures predominantly focus on change point accuracy or rely on
point-based measures such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which fail to capture
the quality of the detected segments, ignore the nature of errors, and offer
limited interpretability. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by
introducing two novel evaluation measures: WARI (Weighted Adjusted Rand Index),
that accounts for the position of segmentation errors, and SMS (State Matching
Score), a fine-grained measure that identifies and scores four fundamental
types of segmentation errors while allowing error-specific weighting. We
empirically validate WARI and SMS on synthetic and real-world benchmarks,
showing that they not only provide a more accurate assessment of segmentation
quality but also uncover insights, such as error provenance and type, that are
inaccessible with traditional measures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAHQ通过注意力头量化加速自动电路发现，在保持分析忠实度的同时显著降低计算时间和内存消耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ACDC方法在大语言模型中计算效率低、内存需求高，而加速方法主要依赖线性近似，这会显著损害分析忠实度

Method: PAHQ通过将激活修补与混合精度量化对齐，仅对研究组件保持高精度，其他部分降低精度，从而优化每个修补操作的效率

Result: PAHQ加速的ACDC相比未加速版本，运行时间减少高达80%，内存消耗减少高达30%，同时保持忠实度

Conclusion: PAHQ提供了一种无需训练的实际方法，可加速机制可解释性分析，并能与现有基于边缘的电路发现技术无缝集成

Abstract: Circuit discovery, which involves identifying sparse and task-relevant
subnetworks in pre-trained language models, is a cornerstone of mechanistic
interpretability. Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC) has emerged as a pivotal
methodology in circuit discovery, but its application to large language models
is severely limited by computational inefficiency and prohibitively high memory
requirements. Although several accelerated approaches have been proposed, they
primarily rely on linear approximations to ACDC, which significantly
compromises analytical faithfulness. Our proposed method for accelerating
automated circuit discovery, Per Attention Head Quantization (PAHQ), takes a
fundamentally different approach by optimizing the efficiency of each
individual patching operation. PAHQ leverages a fundamental alignment between
activation patching and mixed-precision quantization (MPQ): interpretability
analysis through patching essentially performs targeted ablation studies.
Therefore, we can maintain high precision exclusively for investigated
components while safely reducing precision elsewhere in the network.
PAHQ-accelerated ACDC reduces runtime by up to 80\% and memory consumption by
up to 30\% compared to unaccelerated ACDC while maintaining faithfulness.
Importantly, our method readily integrates with existing edge-based circuit
discovery techniques by modifying the attention computation mechanism. This
training-free approach provides a practical and novel pathway for accelerating
mechanistic interpretability methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAMPE是一个统一的多模态蛋白质嵌入框架，通过最优传输表示对齐解决跨模态分布不匹配问题，通过条件图生成融合方法吸收图感知知识，显著提升蛋白质功能预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质功能预测需要融合异质的内部信号（如序列和结构）和噪声的外部上下文（如蛋白质相互作用和GO注释），但存在跨模态嵌入分布不匹配和噪声关系图影响GNN信息聚合两大挑战。

Method: 提出DAMPE框架：1）基于最优传输的表示对齐，建立不同模态内部嵌入空间的对应关系；2）基于条件图生成的信息融合方法，通过条件编码器融合对齐后的内部嵌入来重建图结构。

Result: 在标准GO基准测试中，DAMPE优于或匹配DPFunc等最先进方法，AUPR提升0.002-0.013 pp，Fmax提升0.004-0.007 pp。消融研究显示OT对齐贡献0.043-0.064 pp AUPR，CGG融合贡献0.005-0.111 pp Fmax。

Conclusion: DAMPE提供了一个可扩展且理论基础的鲁棒多模态蛋白质表示学习方法，显著增强了蛋白质功能预测能力。

Abstract: Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous
intrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts
(e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key
challenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch
among embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy
relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information
aggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding
(DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms.
First, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that
establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different
modalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we
develop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method,
where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide
informative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis
implies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb
graph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically,
DAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on
standard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains
0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment
contributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp
Fmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for
robust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing
protein function prediction.

*Daiyuan Li,Shreya Arya,Robert Ghrist*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Torsor CNNs框架，用于在具有局部对称性的图上学习，通过边势能编码相邻坐标系之间的群值变换，解决了传统等变神经网络仅依赖全局对称性的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统等变神经网络依赖单一全局对称性，无法处理具有局部对称性的领域。本文旨在开发能够处理图上局部对称性的神经网络框架。

Method: 引入Torsor CNNs框架，使用边势能表示相邻坐标系间的群值变换，构建了Torsor卷积层和frustration损失函数，该框架统一并推广了经典CNN和Gauge CNNs。

Result: 建立了该几何构造与经典群同步问题的等价性，证明了Torsor卷积层对局部坐标系变化的等变性，并展示了该框架在多视角3D识别中的应用。

Conclusion: Torsor CNN框架为在任意图上处理局部对称性提供了理论基础和实用工具，无需全局坐标系或光滑流形结构，扩展了等变神经网络的应用范围。

Abstract: Most equivariant neural networks rely on a single global symmetry, limiting
their use in domains where symmetries are instead local. We introduce Torsor
CNNs, a framework for learning on graphs with local symmetries encoded as edge
potentials -- group-valued transformations between neighboring coordinate
frames. We establish that this geometric construction is fundamentally
equivalent to the classical group synchronization problem, yielding: (1) a
Torsor Convolutional Layer that is provably equivariant to local changes in
coordinate frames, and (2) the frustration loss -- a standalone geometric
regularizer that encourages locally equivariant representations when added to
any NN's training objective. The Torsor CNN framework unifies and generalizes
several architectures -- including classical CNNs and Gauge CNNs on manifolds
-- by operating on arbitrary graphs without requiring a global coordinate
system or smooth manifold structure. We establish the mathematical foundations
of this framework and demonstrate its applicability to multi-view 3D
recognition, where relative camera poses naturally define the required edge
potentials.

Motivation: 通过结合多实例学习和基于Transformer的符号回归，利用同一系统的重复观测来学习更通用的动态表示。

Result: 在1到4维系统和不同噪声水平下进行评估，始终优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MIO能够有效利用多个观测轨迹来提升符号常微分方程推断的性能。

Abstract: We introduce MIO, a transformer-based model for inferring symbolic ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) from multiple observed trajectories of a
dynamical system. By combining multiple instance learning with
transformer-based symbolic regression, the model effectively leverages repeated
observations of the same system to learn more generalizable representations of
the underlying dynamics. We investigate different instance aggregation
strategies and show that even simple mean aggregation can substantially boost
performance. MIO is evaluated on systems ranging from one to four dimensions
and under varying noise levels, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播算法能效低下且不太可能在大脑中实现，需要研究更高效、受大脑启发的替代算法。

Method: 采用优化理论方法分析PC的学习动态，将其理解为近似信任域方法，并提出新的μPC参数化方法。

Result: PC可以利用高阶信息，学习环境比损失函数环境更良性；μPC首次实现100+层网络的稳定训练，在简单任务上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该论文显著推进了对PCN推理和学习动态的基本理解，但未来研究需要关注硬件协同设计，以便PC能与BP在大规模应用上竞争。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the standard algorithm for training the deep neural
networks that power modern artificial intelligence including large language
models. However, BP is energy inefficient and unlikely to be implemented by the
brain. This thesis studies an alternative, potentially more efficient
brain-inspired algorithm called predictive coding (PC). Unlike BP, PC networks
(PCNs) perform inference by iterative equilibration of neuron activities before
learning or weight updates. Recent work has suggested that this iterative
inference procedure provides a range of benefits over BP, such as faster
training. However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the
inference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep
PCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards
scaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory.
First, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an
approximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite
explicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this
approximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily
higher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective
landscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing
gradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape. Third, motivated by a
study of the inference dynamics of PCNs, we propose a new parameterisation
called ``$\mu$PC'', which for the first time allows stable training of 100+
layer networks with little tuning and competitive performance on simple tasks.
Overall, this thesis significantly advances our fundamental understanding of
the inference and learning dynamics of PCNs, while highlighting the need for
future research to focus on hardware co-design if PC is to compete with BP at
scale.

Conclusion: GRAD作为自动驾驶系统中可靠高效的实时异常检测解决方案，在保证车辆安全运行的同时具有最小的计算开销。

Abstract: This paper introduces GRAD, a real-time anomaly detection method for
autonomous vehicle sensors that integrates statistical analysis and deep
learning to ensure the reliability of sensor data. The proposed approach
combines the Reinforced Exponential Moving Average (REMA), which adapts
smoothing factors and thresholding for outlier detection, with the Multi-Stage
Sliding Window (MS-SW) technique for capturing both short- and long-term
patterns. These features are processed using a lightweight Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) model, which detects and classifies anomalies based on bias types, while
a recovery module restores damaged sensor data to ensure continuous system
operation. GRAD has a lightweight architecture consisting of two layers of GRU
with a limited number of neurons that make it appropriate for real-time
applications while maintaining high detection accuracy. The GRAD framework
achieved remarkable performance in anomaly detection and classification. The
model demonstrated an overall F1-score of 97.6% for abnormal data and 99.4% for
normal data, signifying its high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and
anomalous sensor data. Regarding the anomaly classification, GRAD successfully
categorized different anomaly types with high precision, enabling the recovery
module to accurately restore damaged sensor data. Relative to analogous
studies, GRAD surpasses current models by attaining a balance between elevated
detection accuracy and diminished computational expense. These results
demonstrate GRAD's potential as a reliable and efficient solution for real-time
anomaly detection in autonomous vehicle systems, guaranteeing safe vehicle
operation with minimal computational overhead.

Motivation: 解决S-LoRA在多设备部署中的通信开销问题，通过改进LoRA适配器的分片策略来提升推理效率。

Method: 约束LoRA因子为块对角矩阵，设计无需额外通信的LoRA适配器分片方案，与基础模型的张量并行执行良好对齐。

Conclusion: 块对角LoRA在保持参数效率的同时，显著降低了通信开销，为多适配器LLM服务提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: When serving a single base LLM with several different LoRA adapters
simultaneously, the adapters cannot simply be merged with the base model's
weights as the adapter swapping would create overhead and requests using
different adapters could not be batched. Rather, the LoRA computations have to
be separated from the base LLM computations, and in a multi-device setup the
LoRA adapters can be sharded in a way that is well aligned with the base
model's tensor parallel execution, as proposed in S-LoRA. However, the S-LoRA
sharding strategy encounters some communication overhead, which may be small in
theory, but can be large in practice. In this paper, we propose to constrain
certain LoRA factors to be block-diagonal, which allows for an alternative way
of sharding LoRA adapters that does not require any additional communication
for the LoRA computations. We demonstrate in extensive experiments that our
block-diagonal LoRA approach is similarly parameter efficient as standard LoRA
(i.e., for a similar number of parameters it achieves similar downstream
performance) and that it leads to significant end-to-end speed-up over S-LoRA.
For example, when serving on eight A100 GPUs, we observe up to 1.79x (1.23x)
end-to-end speed-up with 0.87x (1.74x) the number of adapter parameters for
Llama-3.1-70B, and up to 1.63x (1.3x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.86x (1.73x)
the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-8B.

Abstract: Flood susceptibility mapping (FSM) is vital for disaster prevention but
remains challenging in data-scarce regions where hydrodynamic models require

Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) with Thinking-in-Modality (TiM) reasoning,
enabling flood prediction from basic Earth observation data such as Sentinel-1

representation learning. Experiments with TerraMind and Prithvi GFMs show that
TiM enhances model robustness, with the TerraMind-Large configuration achieving
an F1 score of 67.21. The results demonstrate the feasibility of

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful accelerator of
materials discovery, yet most existing models remain problem-specific,
requiring additional data collection and retraining for each new property. Here
we introduce and validate GATE (Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder) -- a
generalizable AI framework that jointly learns 34 physicochemical properties
spanning thermal, electrical, mechanical, and optical domains. By aligning
these properties within a shared geometric space, GATE captures cross-property
correlations that reduce disjoint-property bias -- a key factor causing false
negatives in multi-criteria screening. To demonstrate its generalizability,
GATE -- without any problem-specific reconfiguration -- was directly applied to
the discovery of immersion cooling fluids for data centers, a stringent
real-world challenge defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP). Screening
billions of candidates, GATE identified 92,861 molecules as promising for
practical deployment. Four were experimentally or literarily validated, showing
strong agreement with wet-lab measurements and performance comparable to or
exceeding a commercial coolant. These results establish GATE as a ready-to-use,

models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data
generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural
Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of
feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each
specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a
neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic
specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the
complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG
is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible
instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that
satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics
for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and
\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order,
and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In
this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We
implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug
design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor
molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are
well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood
targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading
clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as
preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for
synthesis and wet-lab testing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RLVR在单次生成问题解决中表现出色，但强化学习微调过程可能损害模型的探索能力，导致生成多样性下降，进而在大N值的Best-of-N采样中性能退化。

Method: 推导了用于直接优化max@k指标的无偏策略梯度估计，并将其扩展到离策略更新以提高样本效率。

Result: 经验表明，该方法在离策略场景中有效优化了max@k指标，使模型与Best-of-N推理策略保持一致。

Conclusion: 提出的目标函数能够有效优化max@k指标，解决RLVR微调过程中的探索能力下降问题。

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to
mathematical and coding domains has demonstrated significant improvements in
the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models. Despite
its success in single generation problem solving, the reinforcement learning
fine-tuning process may harm the model's exploration ability, as reflected in
decreased diversity of generations and a resulting degradation of performance
during Best-of-N sampling for large N values. In this work, we focus on
optimizing the max@k metric, a continuous generalization of pass@k. We derive
an unbiased on-policy gradient estimate for direct optimization of this metric.
Furthermore, we extend our derivations to the off-policy updates, a common
element in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency.
Empirically, we show that our objective effectively optimizes max@k metric in
off-policy scenarios, aligning the model with the Best-of-N inference strategy.

*Youngjun Choi,Joonseong Kang,Sungjun Lim,Kyungwoo Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Eigen-Value (EV)框架，一种用于OOD鲁棒性的即插即用数据估值方法，仅使用ID数据子集，通过谱近似估计领域差异，无需额外训练循环。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据估值方法主要基于ID损失，无法有效泛化到OOD场景，而现有的OOD感知方法计算成本过高，限制了实际部署。

Method: EV通过ID数据协方差矩阵的特征值比率来谱近似领域差异（ID与OOD损失差距），利用扰动理论估计每个数据点对该差异的边际贡献，然后与ID损失方法结合。

Result: 在真实数据集上，EV实现了改进的OOD鲁棒性和稳定的价值排名，同时保持计算轻量级。

Conclusion: EV为具有领域偏移的大规模场景提供了高效的OOD鲁棒数据估值路径，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Data valuation has become central in the era of data-centric AI. It drives
efficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by
assigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation
methods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating
changes in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as
opposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different
patterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods
based on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when
the validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware
methods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \emph{Eigen-Value} (EV),
a plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an
ID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral
approximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and
OOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then
estimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via
perturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV
plugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional
training loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and
stable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining
computationally lightweight. These results indicate that EV is practical for
large-scale settings with domain shift, offering an efficient path to
OOD-robust data valuation.

Abstract: We explore a "best-of-both" approach to modelling molecular properties by
combining learned molecular descriptors from a graph neural network (GNN) with
general-purpose descriptors and a mixed ensemble of machine learning (ML)
models. We introduce a MetaModel framework to aggregate predictions from a
diverse set of leading ML models. We present a featurisation scheme for
combining task-specific GNN-derived features with conventional molecular
descriptors.
  We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the cutting-edge ChemProp model
on all regression datasets tested and 6 of 9 classification datasets. We
further show that including the GNN features derived from ChemProp boosts the
ensemble model's performance on several datasets where it otherwise would have
underperformed. We conclude that to achieve optimal performance across a wide
set of problems, it is vital to combine general-purpose descriptors with
task-specific learned features and use a diverse set of ML models to make the
predictions.

Conclusion: SNN为概率预测提供了一个连贯、可处理的框架，将点估计提升到基于物理启发的振幅分布表示。

Abstract: We introduce the Schrodinger Neural Network (SNN), a principled architecture
for conditional density estimation and uncertainty quantification inspired by
quantum mechanics. The SNN maps each input to a normalized wave function on the
output domain and computes predictive probabilities via the Born rule. The SNN
departs from standard parametric likelihood heads by learning complex
coefficients of a spectral expansion (e . g ., Chebyshev polynomials) whose
squared modulus yields the conditional density $p(y|x)=\left| \psi _x(y)\right|
{}^2$ with analytic normalization. This representation confers three practical
advantages: positivity and exact normalization by construction, native
multimodality through interference among basis modes without explicit mixture
bookkeeping, and yields closed-form (or efficiently computable)
functionals$-$such as moments and several calibration diagnostics$-$as
quadratic forms in coefficient space. We develop the statistical and
computational foundations of the SNN, including (i) training by exact
maximum-likelihood with unit-sphere coefficient parameterization, (ii)
physics-inspired quadratic regularizers (kinetic and potential energies)
motivated by uncertainty relations between localization and spectral
complexity, (iii) scalable low-rank and separable extensions for multivariate
outputs, (iv) operator-based extensions that represent observables,
constraints, and weak labels as self-adjoint matrices acting on the amplitude
space, and (v) a comprehensive framework for evaluating multimodal predictions.
The SNN provides a coherent, tractable framework to elevate probabilistic
prediction from point estimates to physically inspired amplitude-based
distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGFusion是一种利用移动用户地理信息的联邦学习训练算法，通过将数据映射到地理区域并为每个区域训练单独的FL模型，使用层次随机图建模区域间相关性，实现概率性梯度融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用移动用户的地理信息来改进联邦学习，使模型能更好地适应不同地理区域用户的数据和行为特征。

Method: 将移动设备数据映射到地理区域，为每个区域训练单独的FL模型；使用层次随机图建模区域间相关性，通过MCMC采样优化；每个训练步骤中，区域将本地梯度与从HRG采样的其他区域梯度进行融合，使用自注意力权重。

Result: 在6个国家收集的心率预测数据集上，SGFusion训练的模型收敛时具有上界期望误差，在所有国家都显著提高了模型效用，且没有显著影响系统可扩展性。

Conclusion: SGFusion通过地理梯度融合显著提高了模型效用，同时保持了计算效率，是联邦学习中利用地理信息的有效方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes Stochastic Geographic Gradient Fusion (SGFusion), a novel
training algorithm to leverage the geographic information of mobile users in
Federated Learning (FL). SGFusion maps the data collected by mobile devices
onto geographical zones and trains one FL model per zone, which adapts well to
the data and behaviors of users in that zone. SGFusion models the local
data-based correlation among geographical zones as a hierarchical random graph
(HRG) optimized by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. At each training step,
every zone fuses its local gradient with gradients derived from a small set of
other zones sampled from the HRG. This approach enables knowledge fusion and
sharing among geographical zones in a probabilistic and stochastic gradient
fusion process with self-attention weights, such that "more similar" zones have
"higher probabilities" of sharing gradients with "larger attention weights."
SGFusion remarkably improves model utility without introducing undue
computational cost. Extensive theoretical and empirical results using a
heart-rate prediction dataset collected across 6 countries show that models
trained with SGFusion converge with upper-bounded expected errors and
significantly improve utility in all countries compared to existing approaches
without notable cost in system scalability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ADPrompt框架，通过自适应特征校正和消息校准模块，在保持预训练GNN模型冻结的同时，使用可学习提示来增强下游任务的公平性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图提示方法主要关注提升下游任务的效用，但忽视了公平性问题。预训练GNN模型会在人口统计子群间产生歧视性节点表示，因为下游图数据在节点属性和图结构中都存在偏见。

Method: ADPrompt框架包含两个模块：自适应特征校正模块学习定制化属性提示来抑制敏感信息；自适应消息校准模块在每层生成结构提示，调整邻居节点的信息流。两个模块联合优化以适配预训练GNN并增强公平性。

Result: 在四个数据集和四种预训练策略上的实验表明，ADPrompt在节点分类任务上优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: ADPrompt能有效缓解预训练GNN模型在下游任务中的公平性问题，通过双提示机制在保持模型效用的同时提升公平性。

Abstract: In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through
self-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely
adopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for
pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between
pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts
pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable
prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph
prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks,
they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In
fact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations
across demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains
biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we
propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness
for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute
bias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized
attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer,
reducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message
Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust
the message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of
the information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting
modules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct
extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to
evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed
ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 芯片布局对芯片设计质量有重大影响，但缺乏统一的BBO专用基准来全面评估不同问题表述和算法。

Method: 开发了模块化、解耦的灵活框架，集成了三种BBO问题表述（掩码引导优化、超参数优化、序列对优化）和多种算法（模拟退火、进化算法、贝叶斯优化）。

Conclusion: BBOPlace-Bench不仅促进了芯片布局高效BBO解决方案的开发，还为BBO社区拓宽了实际应用场景。

Abstract: Chip placement is a vital stage in modern chip design as it has a substantial
impact on the subsequent processes and the overall quality of the final chip.
The use of black-box optimization (BBO) for chip placement has a history of
several decades. However, early efforts were limited by immature problem
formulations and inefficient algorithm designs. Recent progress has shown the
effectiveness and efficiency of BBO for chip placement, proving its potential
to achieve state-of-the-art results. Despite these advancements, the field
lacks a unified, BBO-specific benchmark for thoroughly assessing various
problem formulations and BBO algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose
BBOPlace-Bench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating and
developing BBO algorithms for chip placement tasks. It integrates three problem
formulations of BBO for chip placement, and offers a modular, decoupled, and
flexible framework that enables users to seamlessly implement, test, and
compare their own algorithms. BBOPlace-Bench integrates a wide variety of
existing BBO algorithms, including simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary
algorithms (EAs), and Bayesian optimization (BO). Experimental results show
that the problem formulations of mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter
optimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem
formulation, while EAs demonstrate better overall performance than SA and BO,
especially in high-dimensional search spaces, and also achieve state-of-the-art
performance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods. BBOPlace-Bench
not only facilitates the development of efficient BBO-driven solutions for chip
placement but also broadens the practical application scenarios (which are
urgently needed) for the BBO community. The code of BBOPlace-Bench is available
at https://github.com/lamda-bbo/BBOPlace-Bench.

TL;DR: T-REGS是一种基于最小生成树长度的自监督学习正则化框架，能同时缓解维度坍塌并促进表示分布的均匀性。


<details>

Motivation: 自监督学习需要避免维度坍塌（特征仅占据低维子空间）并增强表示分布的均匀性，现有方法难以同时解决这两个关键问题。

Method: 提出T-REGS框架，通过最小生成树长度对学习表示进行正则化，理论分析证明该方法在任意紧致黎曼流形上有效。

Result: 在合成数据和经典自监督学习基准测试上的实验验证了该方法的有效性，能够显著提升表示质量。

Conclusion: T-REGS提供了一个简单而有效的正则化框架，能够同时解决自监督学习中的维度坍塌和分布不均匀问题。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data, often by enforcing invariance to
input transformations such as rotations or blurring. Recent studies have
highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding
dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional
subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this
work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on
the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation.
We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously
mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on
arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data
and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at
enhancing representation quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通常消耗过多token，导致计算成本增加和延迟上升，挑战了更长响应能提高准确性的假设

Method: 使用带折扣的强化学习设置来惩罚推理token（可解释为小token成本），并在受限策略类中分析Blackwell最优性

Result: 实验证实该方法能缩短思维链长度，同时保持准确性

Conclusion: 通过惩罚推理token的方法可以有效缩短推理过程而不损失准确性

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often consume excessive tokens, inflating
computational cost and latency. We challenge the assumption that longer
responses improve accuracy. By penalizing reasoning tokens using a discounted
reinforcement learning setup (interpretable as a small token cost) and
analyzing Blackwell optimality in restricted policy classes, we encourage
concise yet accurate reasoning. Experiments confirm our theoretical results
that this approach shortens chains of thought while preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: 该混合精度训练框架为神经ODE提供了一种可靠且高效的训练方案，解决了计算成本和内存需求的关键挑战

Abstract: Exploiting low-precision computations has become a standard strategy in deep
learning to address the growing computational costs imposed by ever larger
models and datasets. However, naively performing all computations in low
precision can lead to roundoff errors and instabilities. Therefore, mixed
precision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use
low-precision computations only for whitelisted operations. Despite their
success, these principles are currently not reliable for training
continuous-time architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations
(Neural ODEs). This paper presents a mixed precision training framework for
neural ODEs, combining explicit ODE solvers with a custom backpropagation
scheme, and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks.
Our scheme uses low-precision computations for evaluating the velocity,
parameterized by the neural network, and for storing intermediate states, while
stability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating
the solution and gradients in higher precision. These contributions address two
key challenges in training neural ODE: the computational cost of repeated
network evaluations and the growth of memory requirements with the number of
time steps or layers. Along with the paper, we publish our extendable,
open-source PyTorch package rampde, whose syntax resembles that of leading
packages to provide a drop-in replacement in existing codes. We demonstrate the
reliability and effectiveness of our scheme using challenging test cases and on
neural ODE applications in image classification and generative models,
achieving approximately 50% memory reduction and up to 2x speedup while
maintaining accuracy comparable to single-precision training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度Chebyshev物理信息KANs在训练时面临稳定性问题，限制了其在PDE问题中的应用。

Method: 提出了与基函数无关的Glorot-like初始化方案，并设计了Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs)架构，结合信息瓶颈分析确保训练稳定性。

Result: 在7个标准前向PDE基准测试中，RGA KANs稳定且性能显著优于参数匹配的cPIKANs和PirateNets，通常高出几个数量级。

Conclusion: RGA KANs通过改进初始化和架构设计，有效解决了深度cPIKANs的训练不稳定问题，在物理信息机器学习中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Since their introduction, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been
successfully applied across several domains, with physics-informed machine
learning (PIML) emerging as one of the areas where they have thrived. In the
PIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the
standard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer
perceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled
to depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to
several PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like
initialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial
improvements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of
cPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce
Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in
deep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical
tests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully
traverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the
diffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward
PDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components
demonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and
PirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in
settings where the others diverge.

Conclusion: DFNMF提供了一种有效平衡公平性与效用的端到端解决方案，具有透明性和可扩展性优势。

Abstract: Fair graph clustering seeks partitions that respect network structure while
maintaining proportional representation across sensitive groups, with
applications spanning community detection, team formation, resource allocation,
and social network analysis. Many existing approaches enforce rigid constraints
or rely on multi-stage pipelines (e.g., spectral embedding followed by
$k$-means), limiting trade-off control, interpretability, and scalability. We
introduce \emph{DFNMF}, an end-to-end deep nonnegative tri-factorization
tailored to graphs that directly optimizes cluster assignments with a soft
statistical-parity regularizer. A single parameter $\lambda$ tunes the
fairness--utility balance, while nonnegativity yields parts-based factors and
transparent soft memberships. The optimization uses sparse-friendly alternating
updates and scales near-linearly with the number of edges. Across synthetic and
real networks, DFNMF achieves substantially higher group balance at comparable
modularity, often dominating state-of-the-art baselines on the Pareto front.

Abstract: Dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) is a recent trend in automated machine
learning, which can dynamically adjust the algorithm's configuration during the
execution process and relieve users from tedious trial-and-error tuning tasks.
Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have improved
the configuration of multiple heterogeneous hyperparameters, making various
parameter configurations for complex algorithms possible. However, many complex
algorithms have inherent inter-dependencies among multiple parameters (e.g.,
determining the operator type first and then the operator's parameter), which
are, however, not considered in previous approaches, thus leading to
sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose the sequential multi-agent DAC
(Seq-MADAC) framework to address this issue by considering the inherent
inter-dependencies of multiple parameters. Specifically, we propose a
sequential advantage decomposition network, which can leverage action-order
information through sequential advantage decomposition. Experiments from
synthetic functions to the configuration of multi-objective optimization
algorithms demonstrate Seq-MADAC's superior performance over state-of-the-art
MARL methods and show strong generalization across problem classes. Seq-MADAC
establishes a new paradigm for the widespread dependency-aware automated
algorithm configuration. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端的多语言翻译系统，结合了U-Net文本检测、Tesseract文本识别和从头训练的Transformer翻译模型，能够直接从图像中翻译文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个完全可定制和自适应的系统，而不是依赖预训练的单一模型，实现从图像中直接翻译文本的功能。

Method: 使用U-Net模型检测图像中的文本区域，Tesseract引擎进行文本识别，然后通过从头训练的序列到序列Transformer模型进行多语言神经机器翻译。

Result: 系统在文本检测精度、文本识别质量和BLEU评分评估的翻译性能方面都表现出有前景的结果。

Conclusion: 验证了构建自定义系统直接从图像翻译文本的可行性，展示了端到端多语言翻译管道的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end multilingual translation pipeline that
integrates a custom U-Net for text detection, the Tesseract engine for text
recognition, and a from-scratch sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer for
Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our approach first utilizes a U-Net model,
trained on a synthetic dataset , to accurately segment and detect text regions
from an image. These detected regions are then processed by Tesseract to
extract the source text. This extracted text is fed into a custom Transformer
model trained from scratch on a multilingual parallel corpus spanning 5
languages. Unlike systems reliant on monolithic pre-trained models, our
architecture emphasizes full customization and adaptability. The system is
evaluated on its text detection accuracy, text recognition quality, and
translation performance via BLEU scores. The complete pipeline demonstrates
promising results, validating the viability of a custom-built system for
translating text directly from images.

*Zhongyi Yu,Jianqiu Wu,Zhenghao Wu,Shuhan Zhong,Weifeng Su,Chul-Ho Lee,Weipeng Zhuo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAMI是一个处理时序图中异构交互的框架，通过时间编码转换和链接历史聚合来改善间歇性交互节点对的链接预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序图中的交互存在异构性，如少数节点对产生大多数交互事件、交互间隔时间不均等，这导致现有方法在预测不频繁交互节点对的链接时效果不佳。

Method: 提出TAMI框架，包含对数时间编码函数（LTE）和链接历史聚合（LHA）两个组件。LTE将交互间隔转换为更平衡的表示，LHA防止目标节点对的历史交互被遗忘。

Result: 在13个经典数据集和3个最新TGB数据集上的实验表明，TAMI在转导和归纳设置下都能持续提升底层模型的链接预测性能。

Conclusion: TAMI能有效处理时序图中的异构交互问题，提升对不频繁交互节点对的链接预测准确性，且可与现有最先进的时序图神经网络无缝集成。

Abstract: Temporal graph link prediction aims to predict future interactions between
nodes in a graph based on their historical interactions, which are encoded in
node embeddings. We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal
interactions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and
interaction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of
ineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions
for a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction.
Existing methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning
process, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective,
especially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs.
To cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which
contains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and
link history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information
through transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA
prevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being
forgotten. State-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly
and readily integrated into TAMI to improve their effectiveness. Experiment
results on 13 classic datasets and three newest temporal graph benchmark (TGB)
datasets show that TAMI consistently improves the link prediction performance
of the underlying models in both transductive and inductive settings. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Alleinx/TAMI_temporal_graph.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DPO-PRO方法，通过轻量级分布鲁棒优化解决DPO对噪声敏感和过拟合的问题，在保持计算效率的同时提升对噪声偏好信号的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO方法虽然简单稳定，但对数据噪声敏感且容易过拟合。现有DRO方法存在过度保守和计算成本高的问题。

Method: DPO-PRO采用轻量级DRO公式处理偏好分布的不确定性，专注于偏好不确定性，避免不必要的保守性。

Result: 在标准对齐基准和真实公共卫生任务上的实验表明，DPO-PRO相比现有DPO变体能持续提升对噪声偏好信号的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种有效的鲁棒微调算法，能显著提升DPO对噪声的鲁棒性，且计算开销可忽略不计。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular method for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) due to its stability and simplicity.
However, it is also known to be sensitive to noise in the data and prone to
overfitting. Recent works have proposed using distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to address potential noise and distributional shift in the
data. However, these methods often suffer from excessive conservatism and high
computational cost. We propose DPO-PRO (DPO with Preference Robustness), a
robust fine-tuning algorithm based on DPO which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution through a lightweight DRO formulation. Unlike prior
DRO-based variants, DPO-PRO focuses solely on uncertainty in preferences,
avoiding unnecessary conservatism and incurring negligible computational
overhead. We further show that DPO-PRO is equivalent to a regularized DPO
objective that penalizes model overconfidence under weak preference signals. We
evaluate DPO-PRO on standard alignment benchmarks and a real-world public
health task. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves
robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准掩码扩散模型在离散生成建模中无法有效捕获并发预测token间的依赖关系，导致在依赖关系重要的场景下生成质量下降。

Method: 在掩码扩散过程中引入潜变量，通过变分推理显式建模token间的依赖关系。

Result: 在合成数据集、数独谜题和文本数据集上的实验表明，VMD成功学习了传统掩码扩散无法捕获的依赖关系，提高了生成质量和全局一致性。

Conclusion: 将变分推理集成到掩码扩散中能够有效增强生成质量和依赖感知能力。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for
discrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked
diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens
that are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when
dependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among
tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that
introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through
controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD
successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to
capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku
puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves
global consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality
and dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational
inference into masked diffusion. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于同化因果推断(ACI)的因果影响范围(CIR)框架，包括前向和后向CIR，用于量化因果关系的时空影响范围，无需经验阈值，并开发了计算高效的近似算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果推断方法主要关注识别因果关系，但同等重要的是确定因果影响的时间范围(CIR)，即因果影响何时出现、持续多久。现有方法缺乏对CIR的数学严谨定义和计算框架。

Method: 采用同化因果推断(ACI)方法，结合贝叶斯数据同化，开发了前向和后向CIR的数学严谨定义。前向CIR量化原因的时间影响，后向CIR追溯观察效应的触发起点。提出了无需经验阈值的客观鲁棒度量，并为非线性动力系统开发了计算高效的闭式表达近似算法。

Conclusion: 该因果影响范围框架为科学、政策和决策提供了直接应用价值，能够精确刻画复杂系统中因果关系的时空动态特性。

Abstract: Causal inference identifies cause-and-effect relationships between variables.
While traditional approaches rely on data to reveal causal links, a recently
developed method, assimilative causal inference (ACI), integrates observations
with dynamical models. It utilizes Bayesian data assimilation to trace causes
back from observed effects by quantifying the reduction in uncertainty. ACI
advances the detection of instantaneous causal relationships and the
intermittent reversal of causal roles over time. Beyond identifying causal
connections, an equally important challenge is determining the associated
causal influence range (CIR), indicating when causal influences emerged and for
how long they persist. In this paper, ACI is employed to develop mathematically
rigorous formulations of both forward and backward CIRs at each time. The
forward CIR quantifies the temporal impact of a cause, while the backward CIR
traces the onset of triggers for an observed effect, thus characterizing causal
predictability and attribution of outcomes at each transient phase,
respectively. Objective and robust metrics for both CIRs are introduced,
eliminating the need for empirical thresholds. Computationally efficient
approximation algorithms to compute CIRs are developed, which facilitate the
use of closed-form expressions for a broad class of nonlinear dynamical
systems. Numerical simulations demonstrate how this forward and backward CIR
framework provides new possibilities for probing complex dynamical systems. It
advances the study of bifurcation-driven and noise-induced tipping points in
Earth systems, investigates the impact from resolving the interfering variables
when determining the influence ranges, and elucidates atmospheric blocking
mechanisms in the equatorial region. These results have direct implications for
science, policy, and decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模型预测中的异构性问题，即不同模型可能更适合不同的输入，需要一种能够根据输入自适应调整模型权重的方法。

Method: 使用输入自适应先验的贝叶斯方法，通过摊销变分推断估计条件于输入的后验分布，为每个预测自适应分配模型权重。

Result: 在回归和分类任务中评估，包括个性化癌症治疗、信用卡欺诈检测和UCI数据集，IA-BMA始终比非自适应基线和现有自适应方法提供更准确和更好校准的预测。

Conclusion: IA-BMA是一种有效的输入自适应模型组合方法，在异构设置中显著优于传统方法，具有形式化性能保证。

Abstract: This paper studies prediction with multiple candidate models, where the goal
is to combine their outputs. This task is especially challenging in
heterogeneous settings, where different models may be better suited to
different inputs. We propose input adaptive Bayesian Model Averaging (IA-BMA),
a Bayesian method that assigns model weights conditional on the input. IA-BMA
employs an input adaptive prior, and yields a posterior distribution that
adapts to each prediction, which we estimate with amortized variational
inference. We derive formal guarantees for its performance, relative to any
single predictor selected per input. We evaluate IABMA across regression and
classification tasks, studying data from personalized cancer treatment,
credit-card fraud detection, and UCI datasets. IA-BMA consistently delivers
more accurate and better-calibrated predictions than both non-adaptive
baselines and existing adaptive methods.

Abstract: Sparse variable selection improves interpretability and generalization in
high-dimensional learning by selecting a small subset of informative features.
Recent advances in Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) have enabled solving
large-scale non-private sparse regression - known as Best Subset Selection
(BSS) - with millions of variables in minutes. However, extending these
algorithmic advances to the setting of Differential Privacy (DP) has remained
largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce two new pure differentially
private estimators for sparse variable selection, levering modern MIP
techniques. Our framework is general and applies broadly to problems like
sparse regression or classification, and we provide theoretical support
recovery guarantees in the case of BSS. Inspired by the exponential mechanism,
we develop structured sampling procedures that efficiently explore the
non-convex objective landscape, avoiding the exhaustive combinatorial search in
the exponential mechanism. We complement our theoretical findings with
extensive numerical experiments, using both least squares and hinge loss for
our objective function, and demonstrate that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art empirical support recovery, outperforming competing algorithms
in settings with up to $p=10^4$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分解预测不确定性为偶然性和认知性成分对机器学习系统开发至关重要，但传统贝叶斯互信息方法需要后验分布，计算困难。

Method: 引入基于bootstrap的频繁主义认知不确定性度量，通过渐近展开证明其与贝叶斯互信息的等价性。

Result: 理论证明提出的频繁主义度量与贝叶斯互信息渐近等价，为深度集成等启发式方法提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为认知不确定性估计提供了新的计算策略，并解释了深度集成方法的成功原理。

Abstract: Decomposing prediction uncertainty into its aleatoric (irreducible) and
epistemic (reducible) components is critical for the development and deployment
of machine learning systems. A popular, principled measure for epistemic
uncertainty is the mutual information between the response variable and model
parameters. However, evaluating this measure requires access to the posterior
distribution of the model parameters, which is challenging to compute. In view
of this, we introduce a frequentist measure of epistemic uncertainty based on
the bootstrap. Our main theoretical contribution is a novel asymptotic
expansion that reveals that our proposed (frequentist) measure and the
(Bayesian) mutual information are asymptotically equivalent. This provides
frequentist interpretations to mutual information and new computational
strategies for approximating it. Moreover, we link our proposed approach to the
widely-used heuristic approach of deep ensembles, giving added perspective on
their practical success.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: MMbeddings是一种概率嵌入方法，通过非线性混合模型重新解释分类嵌入，将嵌入视为变分自编码器中的潜在随机效应，大幅减少参数数量并缓解高基数场景下的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统嵌入方法需要基数×嵌入维度的参数，在基数较大时变得不可行。MMbeddings旨在通过概率方法减少参数数量，解决高基数设置下的过拟合和计算负担问题。

Method: 将嵌入重新解释为非线性混合模型中的潜在随机效应，在变分自编码器框架中实现，参数数量从基数相关变为仅由编码器架构决定的基数无关数量。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，MMbeddings在协同过滤和表格回归任务中始终优于传统嵌入方法。

Conclusion: MMbeddings通过连接经典统计理论和现代深度学习，在高基数场景下展现出优越性能，具有广泛的机器学习应用潜力。

Abstract: We present MMbeddings, a probabilistic embedding approach that reinterprets
categorical embeddings through the lens of nonlinear mixed models, effectively
bridging classical statistical theory with modern deep learning. By treating
embeddings as latent random effects within a variational autoencoder framework,
our method substantially decreases the number of parameters -- from the
conventional embedding approach of cardinality $\times$ embedding dimension,
which quickly becomes infeasible with large cardinalities, to a significantly
smaller, cardinality-independent number determined primarily by the encoder
architecture. This reduction dramatically mitigates overfitting and
computational burden in high-cardinality settings. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real datasets, encompassing collaborative filtering and tabular
regression tasks using varied architectures, demonstrate that MMbeddings
consistently outperforms traditional embeddings, underscoring its potential
across diverse machine learning applications.

TL;DR: MetaCaDI是一个贝叶斯元学习框架，用于联合发现因果图和未知干预，通过解析适应方法避免梯度优化，在数据稀缺情况下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂现实系统通常数据收集成本高且涉及未知干预，揭示其因果机制具有挑战性。

Method: 将因果图和未知干预的联合发现构建为元学习问题，使用贝叶斯框架学习跨实验的共享因果图结构，通过解析适应快速适应少样本干预目标预测任务。

Result: 在合成和复杂基因表达数据上的实验表明，MetaCaDI显著优于最先进方法，在仅10个数据实例的情况下也能很好地进行因果图恢复和干预目标识别。

Conclusion: MetaCaDI在数据稀缺场景下表现出鲁棒性，是第一个将因果发现和未知干预识别作为元学习问题的框架。

Abstract: Uncovering the underlying causal mechanisms of complex real-world systems
remains a significant challenge, as these systems often entail high data
collection costs and involve unknown interventions. We introduce MetaCaDI, the
first framework to cast the joint discovery of a causal graph and unknown
interventions as a meta-learning problem. MetaCaDI is a Bayesian framework that
learns a shared causal graph structure across multiple experiments and is
optimized to rapidly adapt to new, few-shot intervention target prediction
tasks. A key innovation is our model's analytical adaptation, which uses a
closed-form solution to bypass expensive and potentially unstable
gradient-based bilevel optimization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
complex gene expression data demonstrate that MetaCaDI significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It excels at both causal graph recovery
and identifying intervention targets from as few as 10 data instances, proving
its robustness in data-scarce scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SGP方法使用独立分位数回归加后验等渗校正，存在方法论不一致性，且约束联合分位数回归计算复杂度高，难以处理大规模教育数据。

Method: 提出基于神经网络的多分位数回归方法，使用共享隐藏层和组合pinball损失函数，通过SGD优化实现可扩展性和隐式减少分位数交叉。

Result: 实证分析显示独立分位数回归会产生分位数交叉，而约束联合分位数回归和神经网络方法都能保证单调性，神经网络方法具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 神经网络多分位数回归为SGP系统提供了理论有效且计算可行的替代方案，解决了插值悖论和计算复杂度问题。

Abstract: Student Growth Percentiles (SGPs), widely adopted across U.S. state
assessment systems, employ independent quantile regression followed by post-hoc
correction using an isotonic projection method (\texttt{isotonize=TRUE} in the
\texttt{SGP} R package) to address quantile crossing. We demonstrate this
approach contains a fundamental methodological inconsistency: interpolation
between independently-estimated, potentially crossed quantiles requires
monotonicity, yet the post-hoc correction alters estimates in ways that may
violate the quantile property $P(Y \leq \hat{Q}_{\tau}(Y|X) \mid X) = \tau$. We
term this the \emph{interpolation paradox}. While theoretically sound
constrained joint quantile regression (CJQR) eliminates crossing by enforcing
non-crossing constraints during optimization, we analyze its computational
complexity (often scaling poorly, e.g., $\mathcal{O}((qn)^3)$ for standard LP
solvers) rendering it intractable for large-scale educational data ($n >
100{,}000$). We examine the SGP package's switch to the Frisch-Newton interior
point method (\texttt{rq.method.for.large.n="fn"}) for large $N$, noting that
while efficient for \emph{independent} QR, it doesn't resolve the joint
problem's complexity or the paradox. We propose neural network-based
multi-quantile regression (NNQR) with shared hidden layers as a practical
alternative. Leveraging the convexity of the composite pinball loss, SGD-based
optimization used in NN training can reliably approach the global optimum,
offering scalability ($O(n)$) and implicitly reducing crossing. Our empirical
analysis shows independent QR yields crossing, while both CJQR and NNQR enforce
monotonicity. NNQR emerges as a viable, scalable alternative for operational
SGP systems, aligning theoretical validity with computational feasibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Sinkhorn算法广泛用于解决静态最优传输问题，但Pooladian和Niles-Weed(2024)提出的Sinkhorn桥方法在单样本估计设置中已有统计保证。本文旨在进一步验证该方法在双样本估计设置中的性能。

Method: 研究Sinkhorn桥迭代在双样本估计设置中的统计性能，其中仅从源分布和目标分布获得有限样本。建立Sinkhorn迭代的平方总变差误差统计界。

Result: 建立了Sinkhorn桥迭代的平方总变差误差统计界：$O(1/m+1/n + r^{4k})~(r \in (0,1))$，其中$m$和$n$分别是源分布和目标分布的样本量，$k$是Sinkhorn迭代次数。

Conclusion: 结果为Schrödinger桥估计器的有限样本性能提供了理论保证，并为选择样本大小和Sinkhorn迭代次数提供了实践指导。理论结果通过先前未被注意的连接适用于几种代表性方法。

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem seeks the optimal stochastic process that
connects two given probability distributions with minimal energy modification.
While the Sinkhorn algorithm is widely used to solve the static optimal
transport problem, a recent work (Pooladian and Niles-Weed, 2024) proposed the
Sinkhorn bridge, which estimates Schr\"odinger bridges by plugging optimal
transport into the time-dependent drifts of SDEs, with statistical guarantees
in the one-sample estimation setting where the true source distribution is
fully accessible. In this work, to further justify this method, we study the
statistical performance of intermediate Sinkhorn iterations in the two-sample
estimation setting, where only finite samples from both source and target
distributions are available. Specifically, we establish a statistical bound on
the squared total variation error of Sinkhorn bridge iterations: $O(1/m+1/n +
r^{4k})~(r \in (0,1))$, where $m$ and $n$ are the sample sizes from the source
and target distributions, respectively, and $k$ is the number of Sinkhorn
iterations. This result provides a theoretical guarantee for the finite-sample
performance of the Schr\"odinger bridge estimator and offers practical guidance
for selecting sample sizes and the number of Sinkhorn iterations. Notably, our
theoretical results apply to several representative methods such as [SF]$^2$M,
DSBM-IMF, BM2, and LightSB(-M) under specific settings, through the previously
unnoticed connection between these estimators.

Conclusion: 提出的基于因果模型的半监督学习框架能够有效利用未标记数据，通过因果生成模型生成合成数据来提高预测性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to train a machine learning model using
both labelled and unlabelled data. While the unlabelled data have been used in
various ways to improve the prediction accuracy, the reason why unlabelled data
could help is not fully understood. One interesting and promising direction is
to understand SSL from a causal perspective. In light of the independent causal
mechanisms principle, the unlabelled data can be helpful when the label causes
the features but not vice versa. However, the causal relations between the
features and labels can be complex in real world applications. In this paper,
we propose a SSL framework that works with general causal models in which the
variables have flexible causal relations. More specifically, we explore the
causal graph structures and design corresponding causal generative models which
can be learned with the help of unlabelled data. The learned causal generative
model can generate synthetic labelled data for training a more accurate
predictive model. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method by
empirical studies on both simulated and real data.

Motivation: 现有BCD算法在神经网络中仅能保证收敛到驻点，缺乏全局最优性保证。本文旨在填补这一空白，证明BCD可以收敛到全局最小值。

Method: 采用块坐标下降算法，分析输出层损失指数下降而隐藏层损失受控的性质。提出带跳跃连接和非负投影的改进BCD算法以支持ReLU激活函数。

Result: 理论证明BCD在严格单调激活函数下能收敛到全局最小值，损失可任意小。实验验证了严格单调和ReLU激活函数下BCD都能达到小损失。

Conclusion: BCD算法不仅具有强优化保证，还能提供良好的泛化性能，为神经网络训练提供了新的理论支撑。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm for
training deep neural networks and provide a new global convergence guarantee
under strictly monotonically increasing activation functions. While existing
works demonstrate convergence to stationary points for BCD in neural networks,
our contribution is the first to prove convergence to global minima, ensuring
arbitrarily small loss. We show that the loss with respect to the output layer
decreases exponentially while the loss with respect to the hidden layers
remains well-controlled. Additionally, we derive generalization bounds using
the Rademacher complexity framework, demonstrating that BCD not only achieves
strong optimization guarantees but also provides favorable generalization
performance. Moreover, we propose a modified BCD algorithm with skip
connections and non-negative projection, extending our convergence guarantees
to ReLU activation, which are not strictly monotonic. Empirical experiments
confirm our theoretical findings, showing that the BCD algorithm achieves a
small loss for strictly monotonic and ReLU activations.

Abstract: Online learning algorithms continually update their models as data arrive,
making it essential to accurately estimate the expected loss at the current
time step. The prequential method is an effective estimation approach which can
be practically deployed in various ways. However, theoretical guarantees have
previously been established under strong conditions on the algorithm, and
practical algorithms have hyperparameters which require careful tuning. We
introduce OEUVRE, an estimator that evaluates each incoming sample on the
function learned at the current and previous time steps, recursively updating
the loss estimate in constant time and memory. We use algorithmic stability, a
property satisfied by many popular online learners, for optimal updates and
prove consistency, convergence rates, and concentration bounds for our
estimator. We design a method to adaptively tune OEUVRE's hyperparameters and
test it across diverse online and stochastic tasks. We observe that OEUVRE
matches or outperforms other estimators even when their hyperparameters are
tuned with oracle access to ground truth.

*Wenxi Cai,Yuheng Wang,Naichen Shi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了耦合流匹配(CPFM)框架，结合可控降维和高保真重建，通过耦合连续流学习高维数据和低维嵌入的联合分布，保留残差信息在流网络中实现精确控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降维方法在压缩过程中丢弃的信息难以恢复，需要一种能同时实现可控降维和高保真重建的方法。

Method: 使用扩展的Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输目标建立数据与嵌入的概率对应关系，结合双条件流匹配网络在底层空间外推对应关系。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CPFM产生语义丰富的嵌入，并以比现有基线更高的保真度重建数据。

Conclusion: CPFM框架成功实现了可控降维和高保真重建的统一，为语义因素控制提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Coupled Flow Matching (CPFM), a framework that integrates
controllable dimensionality reduction and high-fidelity reconstruction. CPFM
learns coupled continuous flows for both the high-dimensional data x and the
low-dimensional embedding y, which enables sampling p(y|x) via a latent-space
flow and p(x|y) via a data-space flow. Unlike classical dimension-reduction
methods, where information discarded during compression is often difficult to
recover, CPFM preserves the knowledge of residual information within the
weights of a flow network. This design provides bespoke controllability: users
may decide which semantic factors to retain explicitly in the latent space,
while the complementary information remains recoverable through the flow
network. Coupled flow matching builds on two components: (i) an extended
Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport objective that establishes a probabilistic
correspondence between data and embeddings, and (ii) a dual-conditional
flow-matching network that extrapolates the correspondence to the underlying
space. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that CPFM yields semantically
rich embeddings and reconstructs data with higher fidelity than existing
baselines.

*Diego Marcondes*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文为物理信息统计学习(PISL)建立了理论框架，分析了软惩罚与硬约束的权衡，以及物理知识相比纯数据驱动方法的统计增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然PISL方法在实践中广泛使用，但关于信息正则化如何影响统计特性的全面理论理解仍然缺失，特别是软惩罚与硬约束的权衡问题，以及物理知识相比纯数据驱动方法的统计增益问题。

Method: 针对凸函数类中线性方程表达的物理知识，基于小球方法开发了适当的复杂度依赖误差率。

Result: 在适当假设下，物理信息估计器的误差率与硬约束经验误差最小化器相当，仅相差常数项；信息惩罚能有效降低模型复杂度，类似于降维，从而提升学习性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为评估凸函数类中物理信息估计器的统计特性建立了理论框架，有助于弥合统计理论与实际PISL之间的差距，并有望应用于文献中尚未探索的案例。

Abstract: Physics-informed statistical learning (PISL) integrates empirical data with
physical knowledge to enhance the statistical performance of estimators. While
PISL methods are widely used in practice, a comprehensive theoretical
understanding of how informed regularization affects statistical properties is
still missing. Specifically, two fundamental questions have yet to be fully
addressed: (1) what is the trade-off between considering soft penalties versus
hard constraints, and (2) what is the statistical gain of incorporating
physical knowledge compared to purely data-driven empirical error minimisation.
In this paper, we address these questions for PISL in convex classes of
functions under physical knowledge expressed as linear equations by developing
appropriate complexity dependent error rates based on the small-ball method. We
show that, under suitable assumptions, (1) the error rates of physics-informed
estimators are comparable to those of hard constrained empirical error
minimisers, differing only by constant terms, and that (2) informed
penalization can effectively reduce model complexity, akin to dimensionality
reduction, thereby improving learning performance. This work establishes a
theoretical framework for evaluating the statistical properties of
physics-informed estimators in convex classes of functions, contributing to
closing the gap between statistical theory and practical PISL, with potential
applications to cases not yet explored in the literature.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Almost Tracking的算法，用于解决预算受限的最佳臂识别问题，该算法在流行的风险度量H1上具有理论保证，且无需提前知道总预算或丢弃大量样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最佳臂识别问题在A/B测试等实际场景中很常见，现有方法要么局限于特定风险度量，要么需要提前知道总预算或丢弃大量样本，缺乏实用性和普适性。

Method: 基于一个可证明在极小极大意义上最优的算法框架，提出了Almost Tracking算法，该算法具有闭式解，不需要提前知道总预算，也不需要丢弃大量样本。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该算法在性能上优于现有的随时算法和固定预算算法。

Conclusion: Almost Tracking算法在最佳臂识别问题上提供了实用的解决方案，兼具理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: We consider the best arm identification problem, where the goal is to
identify the arm with the highest mean reward from a set of $K$ arms under a
limited sampling budget. This problem models many practical scenarios such as
A/B testing. We consider a class of algorithms for this problem, which is
provably minimax optimal up to a constant factor. This idea is a generalization
of existing works in fixed-budget best arm identification, which are limited to
a particular choice of risk measures. Based on the framework, we propose Almost
Tracking, a closed-form algorithm that has a provable guarantee on the popular
risk measure $H_1$. Unlike existing algorithms, Almost Tracking does not
require the total budget in advance nor does it need to discard a significant
part of samples, which gives a practical advantage. Through experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that our algorithm outperforms
existing anytime algorithms as well as fixed-budget algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer在预训练分布和测试分布存在差异时的学习能力，特别是在任务难度变化和分布偏移情况下的性能表现。

Method: 使用混合分布预训练Transformer，在非参数回归和多索引模型上分析其收敛性能，考虑卡方散度约束下的分布偏移。

Result: 证明预训练Transformer在足够数据下能实现与任务难度级别对应的最优收敛率，且在分布偏移下具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 预训练Transformer不仅能适应不同难度任务，还能在分布偏移下保持最优性能，其收敛率甚至优于已知测试分布的估计器。

Abstract: We study in-context learning problems where a Transformer is pretrained on
tasks drawn from a mixture distribution $\pi=\sum_{\alpha\in\mathcal{A}}
\lambda_{\alpha} \pi_{\alpha}$, called the pretraining prior, in which each
mixture component $\pi_{\alpha}$ is a distribution on tasks of a specific
difficulty level indexed by $\alpha$. Our goal is to understand the performance
of the pretrained Transformer when evaluated on a different test distribution
$\mu$, consisting of tasks of fixed difficulty $\beta\in\mathcal{A}$, and with
potential distribution shift relative to $\pi_\beta$, subject to the
chi-squared divergence $\chi^2(\mu,\pi_{\beta})$ being at most $\kappa$. In
particular, we consider nonparametric regression problems with random
smoothness, and multi-index models with random smoothness as well as random
effective dimension. We prove that a large Transformer pretrained on sufficient
data achieves the optimal rate of convergence corresponding to the difficulty
level $\beta$, uniformly over test distributions $\mu$ in the chi-squared
divergence ball. Thus, the pretrained Transformer is able to achieve faster
rates of convergence on easier tasks and is robust to distribution shift at
test time. Finally, we prove that even if an estimator had access to the test
distribution $\mu$, the convergence rate of its expected risk over $\mu$ could
not be faster than that of our pretrained Transformers, thereby providing a
more appropriate optimality guarantee than minimax lower bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完全校准仅适用于低维预测问题，而高维问题中的弱校准形式缺乏决策理论性质。本文旨在研究在部分校准保证下，保守决策者如何鲁棒地映射预测到行动。

Method: 通过对偶论证来刻画极小极大最优决策规则，并分析不同校准保证下的最优决策策略。

Abstract: Calibration has emerged as a foundational goal in ``trustworthy machine
learning'', in part because of its strong decision theoretic semantics.
Independent of the underlying distribution, and independent of the decision
maker's utility function, calibration promises that amongst all policies
mapping predictions to actions, the uniformly best policy is the one that
``trusts the predictions'' and acts as if they were correct. But this is true
only of \emph{fully calibrated} forecasts, which are tractable to guarantee
only for very low dimensional prediction problems. For higher dimensional
prediction problems (e.g. when outcomes are multiclass), weaker forms of
calibration have been studied that lack these decision theoretic properties. In
this paper we study how a conservative decision maker should map predictions
endowed with these weaker (``partial'') calibration guarantees to actions, in a
way that is robust in a minimax sense: i.e. to maximize their expected utility
in the worst case over distributions consistent with the calibration
guarantees. We characterize their minimax optimal decision rule via a duality
argument, and show that surprisingly, ``trusting the predictions and acting
accordingly'' is recovered in this minimax sense by \emph{decision calibration}
(and any strictly stronger notion of calibration), a substantially weaker and
more tractable condition than full calibration. For calibration guarantees that
fall short of decision calibration, the minimax optimal decision rule is still
efficiently computable, and we provide an empirical evaluation of a natural one
that applies to any regression model solved to optimize squared error.

TL;DR: 本文利用随机投影和有损压缩技术建立了统计学习算法泛化误差的新条件互信息(CMI)界限，证明这些界限比现有界限更紧，并为某些问题实例提供O(1/√n)的泛化保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MI和CMI界限在某些问题实例中变得空洞或无法正确描述泛化行为，需要建立更紧的界限来提供合适的泛化保证。

Method: 使用随机投影和有损压缩技术来建立新的条件互信息界限。

Result: 新界限比现有界限更紧，为特定问题实例提供O(1/√n)的泛化保证，并证明存在不记忆训练数据但具有可比泛化误差的辅助算法。

Conclusion: 记忆化对于良好泛化不是必要的，存在不记忆训练数据但能达到可比泛化性能的算法。

Abstract: In this paper, we leverage stochastic projection and lossy compression to
establish new conditional mutual information (CMI) bounds on the generalization
error of statistical learning algorithms. It is shown that these bounds are
generally tighter than the existing ones. In particular, we prove that for
certain problem instances for which existing MI and CMI bounds were recently
shown in Attias et al. [2024] and Livni [2023] to become vacuous or fail to
describe the right generalization behavior, our bounds yield suitable
generalization guarantees of the order of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$, where $n$
is the size of the training dataset. Furthermore, we use our bounds to
investigate the problem of data "memorization" raised in those works, and which
asserts that there are learning problem instances for which any learning
algorithm that has good prediction there exist distributions under which the
algorithm must "memorize" a big fraction of the training dataset. We show that
for every learning algorithm, there exists an auxiliary algorithm that does not
memorize and which yields comparable generalization error for any data
distribution. In part, this shows that memorization is not necessary for good
generalization.

Conclusion: 该工作为问答系统中的在线分类问题提供了理论保证和实用算法，在不同时间尺度下都能有效平衡专家成本和分类准确性。

Abstract: We introduce and study an online problem arising in question answering
systems. In this problem, an agent must sequentially classify user-submitted
queries represented by $d$-dimensional embeddings drawn i.i.d. from an unknown
distribution. The agent may consult a costly human expert for the correct
label, or guess on her own without receiving feedback. The goal is to minimize
regret against an oracle with free expert access. When the time horizon $T$ is
at least exponential in the embedding dimension $d$, one can learn the geometry
of the class regions: in this regime, we propose the Conservative Hull-based
Classifier (CHC), which maintains convex hulls of expert-labeled queries and
calls the expert as soon as a query lands outside all known hulls. CHC attains
$\mathcal{O}(\log^d T)$ regret in $T$ and is minimax optimal for $d=1$.
Otherwise, the geometry cannot be reliably learned without additional
distributional assumptions. We show that when the queries are drawn from a
subgaussian mixture, for $T \le e^d$, a Center-based Classifier (CC) achieves
regret proportional to $N\log{N}$ where $N$ is the number of labels. To bridge
these regimes, we introduce the Generalized Hull-based Classifier (GHC), a
practical extension of CHC that allows for more aggressive guessing via a
tunable threshold parameter. Our approach is validated with experiments,
notably on real-world question-answering datasets using embeddings derived from
state-of-the-art large language models.
