### [1] [A Structured Family of Grassmannian Constellations via Geodesic Mapping for MIMO Noncoherent Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15070)
*Álvaro Pendás-Recondo,Enrique Pendás-Recondo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Grassmann流形测地线的新型结构化星座设计，用于MIMO非相干通信，具有单天线激活特性，显著降低硬件复杂度和功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对MIMO非相干通信中缺乏信道状态信息的问题，设计结构化星座以降低实现复杂度，同时保持良好性能。

Method: 利用Grassmann流形的几何结构，基于测地线构建星座，确保每时隙只有一个发射天线激活。

Result: 在频谱效率限制下(最大4M²星座点)，性能与最先进的无结构设计相当，同时ML检测器复杂度降低M倍。

Conclusion: 该设计在保持性能的同时显著降低了硬件复杂度和功耗，为低复杂度MIMO系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents a novel structured family of Grassmannian constellations
for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) noncoherent communications over
Rayleigh block-fading channels, where neither the transmitter nor the receiver
has channel state information (CSI). The proposed constellation design is built
upon the geodesic curves of the Grassmann manifold, thereby exploiting its
underlying geometric structure. The resulting solution is limited in spectral
efficiency (with a maximum constellation size of $4M^2$ points, where $M$ is
the number of transmit antennas), targeting a rate in the range of $0.25$-$1$
bps/Hz. However, all space-time matrices resulting from this design exhibit the
remarkable property of having a single nonzero entry per row, meaning that only
one transmit antenna is active per time slot. This property significantly
reduces hardware complexity and implementation cost, while also lowering power
consumption, as only a single power amplifier is required for transmission.
Furthermore, within the constellation size limits, the proposed design achieves
error performance comparable to state-of-the-art optimization-based
unstructured designs, as validated through symbol error rate (SER) numerical
results. It also enables simple yet effective bit labeling, confirmed by
comparisons of bit error rate (BER) and SER, and reduces the computational
complexity of the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector for Grassmannian
constellations by a factor of $M$.

### [2] [Pulse Shaping Filter Design for Integrated Sensing & Communication with Zak-OTFS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15195)
*Nishant Mehrotra,Sandesh Rao Mattu,Robert Calderbank*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过各向同性正交变换算法设计的新型脉冲整形滤波器，该滤波器同时满足定位性、正交性和带宽/时间限制三个目标，在Zak-OTFS集成感知与通信框架中实现了优于现有滤波器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Zak-OTFS集成感知与通信系统中，脉冲整形滤波器的设计至关重要。现有滤波器设计（如sinc、高斯、RRC等）只能同时满足三个关键目标中的两个：定位性（用于感知）、正交性（用于通信）和带宽/时间限制（用于频谱效率），无法同时满足所有三个目标。

Method: 采用各向同性正交变换算法（Isotropic Orthogonal Transform Algorithm）来设计最优脉冲整形滤波器，确保滤波器同时具备定位性、正交性和带宽/时间限制特性。

Result: 所提出的脉冲整形滤波器在数据检测（通信）和输入输出关系估计（感知）方面均优于文献中现有的滤波器选择，提供了更好的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过各向同性正交变换算法设计的脉冲整形滤波器成功解决了Zak-OTFS集成感知与通信系统中滤波器设计的核心挑战，实现了定位性、正交性和带宽/时间限制三个关键目标的完美结合。

Abstract: Zak-OTFS is an emerging framework for integrated sensing & communication
(ISAC) in high delay and Doppler spread environments. A critical enabler for
ISAC with Zak-OTFS is the design of pulse shaping filters. For sensing, a
localized pulse shaping filter enables ideal input-output (I/O) relation
estimates close to the physical scattering channel. For communication,
orthogonality of the pulse shape on the information lattice prevents
inter-symbol interference, and no time and bandwidth expansion enables full
spectral efficiency. A filter simultaneously meeting all three objectives is
ideal for ISAC. Existing filter designs achieve two of the above objectives,
but not all three simultaneously. For instance, the sinc filter is orthogonal
and bandwidth/time-limited, but is not localized. The Gaussian filter is
localized and bandwidth/time-limited, but not orthogonal. The RRC filter is
localized and orthogonal, but not bandwidth/time-limited. A recently proposed
hybrid Gaussian-sinc filter is more localized than the sinc filter and
bandwidth/time-limited, but is not orthogonal. In this work, we design optimal
pulse shaping filters meeting all three objectives via the Isotropic Orthogonal
Transform Algorithm. The proposed pulse shaping filters offer improved data
detection (communication) and I/O relation estimation (sensing) performance
compared to existing filter choices in the literature.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多维生理特征的MIMO生物雷达生命体征增强检测方法，通过两阶段融合策略解决多通道信号融合效率低的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人口老龄化加剧和慢性病负担增加，生命体征监测需求日益迫切，当前毫米波雷达非接触检测技术面临多通道信号融合效率低的挑战

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了生命体征检测性能，为MIMO生物雷达系统提供了新的信号处理框架

Abstract: With the intensiffcation of population aging and increasing burden of chronic
diseases, the demand for vital signs monitoring is becoming increasingly
urgent. A key challenge facing current non-contact detection technologies using
millimeter wave (mmWave) radar is the low efffciency of multi-channel signal
fusion in array radar systems based on equal weighting. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes a vital sign enhancement detection method for
multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) bio-radar, driven by multidimensional
physiological characteristics, which overcomes traditional limitations through
a two-stage fusion strategy. Stage 1: Enhanced Vital Sign Detection Using
Single-Channel Signals Based on Physiological Characteristics. First, a chest
wall multi-scattering point model is constructed. For single channel
time-distance two-dimensional echo signals, effective range bins are selected
based on the respiratory/cardiac physiological frequency band energy ratio, and
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of respiration/heart signals is enhanced using
phase-aligned maximal ratio combining (MRC). Stage 2: Multi-Channel Fusion
Based on Organ Radiation Spatial Distribution Characteristics. The spatial
radiation characteristics of cardiopulmonary organs are introduced for the
ffrst time as the theoretical foundation for SNR-based channel screening,
channel attribute identiffcation, and multi-channel weighted fusion. Then, we
propose a template matching method to extract respiratory rate (RR) and heart
rate (HR) by adopting physical models of respiration and cardiac activities.
The experimental results demonstrate the existence of the spatial distribution
characteristics of organ radiation. In addition, we analyzed the impact of
distance and state on the algorithm from these two aspects.

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of the functionalities, algorithms, hardware
components, and performance characteristics of future integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) base stations (BSs) under realistic deployment scenarios
in controlled laboratory environments represents a critical requirement for
ISAC technology advancement. A primary challenge in achieving this objective
involves the emulation of multiple targets with arbitrary radar cross-section
(RCS), range, angle, and Doppler profiles for ISAC BS equipped with large-scale
antenna arrays using radar target simulator (RTS) with limited interface ports.
In this work, we introduce a simple yet highly effective and practical
conductive amplitude and phase matrix framework to address this fundamental
challenge. The core concept involves introducing a tunable conductive amplitude
and phase modulation network in the test configuration between the ISAC BS
under test and a RTS. Based on this structure, we subsequently investigate the
corresponding configurations for different sensing operational modes of ISAC
BSs, specifically the array duplex transmission and reception (ADTR) mode and
the split-array transmission and reception (SATR) mode. For experimental
validation, we design two distinct monostatic sensing scenarios to demonstrate
the framework capabilities across both operational modes. The first scenario
involves dynamic multi-drone sensing validation for ADTR mode operation, while
the second scenario addresses static single-drone sensing for SATR mode
validation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework
can accurately emulate the joint RCS, range, velocity, and angular
characteristics of multiple sensing targets within the conductive test
environment, highlighting its significant potential for testing applications in
sub-6 GHz ISAC BS development and validation.

### [5] [Pseudo-Random TDM-MIMO FMCW Based Millimeter-Wave Sensing and Communication Integration for UAV Swarm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15575)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于伪随机TDM-MIMO毫米波FMCW的无人机集群ISAC方案，通过新型ISAC啁啾波形在延迟域和复幅度调制数据，采用压缩感知和啁啾分多址技术实现通信感知一体化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 所提方案成功实现了无人机集群的通信感知一体化，在动态场景下具有良好性能，为无人机协同操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) can achieve the sharing of
hardware and spectrum resources, enabling efficient data transmission and
environmental sensing. This fusion is particularly important for unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms, as it enhances the overall performance,
flexibility, and efficiency of such systems. To facilitate the collaborative
operations among UAVs, this paper proposes an ISAC solution based on the
pseudo-random time-division multiplexing (TDM)-multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW).
Specifically, a novel ISAC chirp waveform is proposed to modulate data in both
the delay domain and complex amplitude, while also possessing high-precision
sensing capabilities. To address challenges in the TDM-MIMO, we utilize the
pseudo-random antenna selection and compressed sensing algorithms, ensuring
that the maximum unambiguous velocity is not compromised. Moreover, by
employing a chirp-division multiple access scheme, we propose an
interference-free multiple antenna transmission scheme to achieve dynamic
allocation of time-frequency resources and multi-user transmission. Finally, we
propose a communication and sensing fusion-based dynamic iterative computation
scheme, simultaneously achieving data demodulation and sensing parameter
estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve ISAC
under the dynamic flight scenarios of UAVs. Meanwhile, the scheme outperforms
the mmWave-LoRadar in communication and sensing performance, yet its sensing
performance is slightly lower than that of the traditional FMCW. Under the
urban clutter modeling, the scheme still maintains favorable robustness despite
a certain degree of performance degradation.

positive infinity.

### [7] [Detection Seizure Onset Zone Using Circadian Fluctuating Epileptic Biomarkers: A Signal Processing and Machine Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15717)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫生物标志物在癫痫治疗术前规划中至关重要，但这些标志物随时间变化显著。研究昼夜节律对生物标志物的影响，可以优化其分析时机，提高手术规划效果。

Method: 回顾性分析局灶性癫痫患者的颅内脑电图数据，通过自动检测识别尖峰、尖峰序列、高频振荡和病理性高频振荡等生物标志物，计算α/δ比率区分睡眠和清醒状态。

Abstract: Epileptic biomarkers play a crucial role in identifying the origin of
seizures, an essential aspect of pre-surgical planning for epilepsy treatment.
These biomarkers can vary significantly over time. By studying these temporal
fluctuations, we can enhance their effectiveness in guiding surgical planning.
This research focuses on examining how circadian rhythms influence epilepsy
biomarkers and aims to determine the optimal times for their analysis. To
investigate the relationship between epilepsy biomarkers and circadian rhythm,
the sleep/wake states first need to be classified. After the biomarkers are
identified, they are compared across these states. A retrospective analysis was
conducted on intracranial electroencephalography data from patients with focal
epilepsy. The biomarkers spike, sequence of spikes, high-frequency oscillations
(HFOs), and pathological HFOs were identified through automatic detection. The
alpha/delta ratio was also calculated to distinguish between asleep and awake
stages. Data from 9 patients were analyzed, and the classification of sleep and
wake states was achieved with an area under the curve of 84%. All biomarker
rates were higher during the sleep stage compared to the wake stage.
Pathological HFOs and the sequence of spikes proved to be more precise
indicators regarding distance to seizure onset than spikes or HFOs. Unlike
previous studies that relied predominantly on long-term spike biomarker
analysis, this study is the first to utilize a comprehensive set of biomarkers,
including HFOs, spike sequences, and pathological HFOs, to enhance seizure
onset zone prediction. The rates of epilepsy biomarkers during sleep vary
considerably from those seen while awake, making sleep data analysis more
effective for accurately predicting the seizure onset zone.

TL;DR: 本文分析了6G本地网络中多RIS系统的电磁干扰和RIS间反射问题，提出了一种基于黎曼共轭梯度法的优化算法来提升系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G本地网络中的可重构智能表面(RIS)在实际部署中会受到电磁干扰(EMI)和RIS间反射(IRR)的负面影响，这些联合效应会显著降低系统性能。

Method: 首先通过系统级仿真评估EMI和IRR的影响，然后提出基于黎曼共轭梯度法的交替优化算法，考虑信道空间相关性来优化RIS相位偏移。

Abstract: The Sixth Generation (6G) radio technology is expected to include local 6G
networks as a special use case, extending the capabilities of `generic' 6G
networks towards more demanding performance requirements. Reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a novel paradigm for next-generation wireless
communications, especially in the context of local 6G networks, enabling
advanced signal propagation control through intelligent phase-shift
configurations. However, in practical deployments, their performance can be
adversely affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI) from external sources
and inter-RIS reflections (IRR) caused by signal reflections between multiple
colocated RIS units. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the joint
impact of EMI and IRR in a multi-RIS multi-cell system deployed within an
indoor factory environment. A detailed evaluation study is first carried out to
investigate their impact on system performance. System-level simulations
demonstrate that the joint impact of EMI and IRR degrades system performance
more significantly than their individual effects, particularly as RIS
dimensions and transmit power increase. To address these adverse effects, an
alternate optimization algorithm using the Riemannian conjugate gradient method
is then proposed. The novel algorithm optimizes the phase shifts of the RIS
elements considering the spatial correlation among their associated channels,
and is found to provide up to several orders of magnitude gains in terms of the
system sum rate and the outage probability.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel and low-complexity atomic multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) receiver architecture assisted by a reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS). By introducing RIS and utilizing pulse amplitude
modulation (PAM), the phase of the transmitted signal is effectively aligned
with that of the local oscillator (LO), thereby mitigating phase ambiguity and
substantially reducing both signal detection complexity and overall receiver
complexity.To tackle the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we
reformulate it into a tractable form by minimizing the Frobenius norm of an
equivalent matrix, which is efficiently solved using an Adam-based gradient
descent algorithm.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于里德堡原子量子(RAQ)的MIMO卫星在直接地面到空间上行链路接入中的性能优势，相比传统RF MIMO在瑞利衰落和卫星信道条件下均表现出色，特别是在长距离传输和严格功率约束场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RAQ-MIMO卫星系统的性能优势，旨在提升直接地面到空间上行链路接入能力，为下一代卫星网络发展提供技术支撑。

Conclusion: RAQ-MIMO卫星系统在性能上优于传统RF MIMO，为下一代卫星网络的发展开辟了新途径，特别是在长距离传输和功率受限场景下具有显著优势。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance advantages of Rydberg atomic quantum
(RAQ)-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) satellites for enhancing
direct ground-to-space uplink access.We analytically evaluate the impact of
Rydberg atoms on channel estimation by deriving closed-form expressions for the
mean-square error (MSE) and normalized mean-square error (NMSE). Based on the
estimated channels, we further derive lower bounds on the achievable data rates
for maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) detection schemes.
Rigorous analysis demonstrates that RAQ-MIMO outperforms conventional
radio-frequency (RF) MIMO under both Rayleigh and satellite channel conditions.
Specifically, compared with conventional MIMO, RAQR achieves a ``squaring" gain
under Rayleigh fading, especially in long-distance transmission scenarios with
stringent power constraints. In contrast, under line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated
satellite channels, this gain saturates as channel-estimation benefits
diminish, with the remaining improvement primarily arising from the normalized
noise background. Monte Carlo simulations validate the analytical results and
show that the performance gains of RAQ-MIMO satellites translate into smaller
antenna apertures, lower transmit power, and longer communication ranges,
thereby paving the way for next-generation satellite networks.

Conclusion: 通过将RAQR与SWIPT-MIMO集成，基站能够可靠检测仅靠收集能量供电的物联网设备的弱上行信号，实现无电池通信。

Abstract: In this paper, we proposed a hybrid simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer (SWIPT)-enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
architecture, where the base station (BS) uses a conventional RF transmitter
for downlink transmission and a Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (RAQR) for
receiving uplink signal from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To fully exploit
this integration, we jointly design the transmission scheme and the
power-splitting strategy to maximize the sum rate, which leads to a non-convex
problem. To address this challenge, we first derive closed-form lower bounds on
the uplink achievable rates for maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing
(ZF), as well as on the downlink rate and harvested energy for maximum ratio
transmission (MRT) and ZF precoding. Building upon these bounds, we propose an
iterative algorithm relying on the best monomial approximation and geometric
programming (GP) to solve the non-convex problem. Finally, simulations validate
the tightness of our derived lower bounds and demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed algorithm over benchmark schemes. Importantly, by integrating RAQR
with SWIPT-enabled MIMO, the BS can reliably detect weak uplink signals from
IoT devices powered only by harvested energy, enabling battery-free
communication.

Abstract: This work addresses the radio resource management (RRM) design in downlink
full-duplex integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, jointly
optimizing timeslot allocation and beam selection under imperfect
self-interference cancellation. Timeslot allocation governs the distribution of
discrete channel uses between sensing and communication tasks, while beam
selection determines transmit and receive directions along with adaptive
beamwidths. The joint design leads to a semi-infinite, nonconvex mixed-integer
nonlinear program (MINLP), which is difficult to solve. To overcome this, we
develop a tailored reformulation strategy that transforms the problem into a
tractable mixed-integer linear program (MILP), enabling globally optimal
solutions. Our approach provides insights into the coordinated optimization of
timeslot allocation and beam selection, enhancing the efficiency of full-duplex
ISAC systems while ensuring resilience against residual self-interference.

Abstract: The reliability of local power grid infrastructure is challenged by
sustainable energy developments increasing electric load uncertainty.
Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need load forecasts of higher spatial
resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to
individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and
require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for
the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations
(operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that
meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a
uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally
evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable
forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to
include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the
heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our
system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting
workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal
forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our
multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with
unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors
precisely.

*Allen Daniel Sunny*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TangledFeatures框架，用于在相关特征空间中进行特征选择，通过识别纠缠预测因子组中的代表性特征来减少冗余并保留解释力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法主要关注预测准确性，但在存在相关预测因子的情况下性能会下降，需要一种能够处理相关特征空间的方法。

Method: 引入TangledFeatures框架，识别相关特征组中的代表性特征，减少冗余同时保持解释能力。

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide数据集上验证了有效性，选择的特征对应结构上有意义的原子间距离，能够解释主链扭转角的变化。

Conclusion: TangledFeatures提供比传统选择技术更可解释和稳定的分析基础，可直接应用于下游模型。

Abstract: Feature selection is a fundamental step in model development, shaping both
predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods
focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of
correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a
framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies
representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing
redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can
be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and
stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying
it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected
features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that
explain variation in these angles.

### [15] [ES-C51: Expected Sarsa Based C51 Distributional Reinforcement Learning Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15006)
*Rijul Tandon,Peter Vamplew,Cameron Foale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了ES-C51算法，通过将C51分布强化学习中的贪婪Q学习更新替换为Expected Sarsa更新，使用softmax结合所有可能动作的信息，解决了当动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于值的RL算法只估计期望奖励，而分布强化学习估计奖励的完整概率分布。C51作为流行的DRL算法，使用贪婪Bellman更新，当多个动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时，可能导致分布学习不稳定。

Method: 提出ES-C51算法，用Expected Sarsa更新替换C51中的贪婪Q学习更新，使用softmax计算结合所有可能动作的信息，而非依赖单一最佳动作。同时将标准C51的探索策略从ε-greedy改为softmax作为对比基线(QL-C51)。

Result: 在Gym经典控制环境和Atari-10游戏上的评估结果表明，ES-C51在多数环境中优于QL-C51。

Conclusion: 使用Expected Sarsa更新的ES-C51能够减少动作奖励分布相似时的不稳定性，使智能体学习到性能更高的策略。

Abstract: In most value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the agent
estimates only the expected reward for each action and selects the action with
the highest reward. In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
estimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing
richer information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL
algorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the
distribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause
problems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with
different distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.
This study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy
Q-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax
calculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather
than relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions
have similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing
policies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,
and Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's
exploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-
Learning based C51). The results demonstrate that ES-C51 outperforms QL-C51
across many environments.

Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector,
where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance
costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer
architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from
high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts
temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then
processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions,
followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without
requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years
of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method
achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to
failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive
maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in
large-scale wind energy deployments.

Motivation: 现有基于最优传输的流式生成模型方法使用小批量样本估计传输计划，限制了在大规模高维数据集上的可扩展性。

Method: 使用半离散最优传输(SDOT)将噪声空间划分为Laguerre单元，每个单元映射到对应的数据点，在训练过程中通过SDOT映射将独立同分布的噪声样本与数据点配对。

Result: AlignFlow能够扩展到大型数据集和模型架构，显著提升了多种最先进流式生成模型算法的性能，可作为即插即用组件使用。

Conclusion: AlignFlow通过SDOT实现了噪声与数据的显式最优对齐，解决了现有方法的可扩展性问题，为流式生成模型训练提供了有效的改进方案。

Abstract: Flow-based Generative Models (FGMs) effectively transform noise into complex
data distributions. Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and
data during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow
trajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based
methods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data
points, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets
in FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages
Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by
establishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data
points with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by
partitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a
corresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired
with data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and
model architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental
results show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of
state-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play
component. Code is available at: https://github.com/konglk1203/AlignFlow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信用评分是金融服务中的高风险任务，需要透明和可信的模型。虽然量子机器学习提供了新的计算能力，但其黑盒特性在需要透明度的领域面临挑战。

Method: 使用变分量子神经网络架构，结合专门为结构化数据设计的后验解释技术，并引入了Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA)指标来量化不同预测类别间的归因差异。

Result: 在两个真实世界信用数据集上的评估显示，IQNN-CS具有稳定的训练动态、有竞争力的预测性能和增强的可解释性。

Conclusion: 为金融决策提供了透明和可问责的量子机器学习模型的实用路径。

Abstract: Credit scoring is a high-stakes task in financial services, where model
decisions directly impact individuals' access to credit and are subject to
strict regulatory scrutiny. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new
computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption
in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present
IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for
multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational
QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured
data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce
Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies
attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model
distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world
credit datasets, IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive
predictive performance, and enhanced interpretability. Our results highlight a
practical path toward transparent and accountable QML models for financial
decision-making.

TL;DR: SPA框架通过自监督微调学习世界模型，然后用于策略优化，显著提升LLM智能体在分布外环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在分布外环境中表现不佳，难以将内部知识与环境动态对齐，导致探索脆弱和泛化能力有限。

Method: 将世界模型分解为状态表示和转移建模，通过自监督微调学习世界模型，然后用于模拟未来状态以优化策略。

Result: 在Sokoban、FrozenLake和Sudoku等环境中，SPA显著提升性能，如Sokoban成功率从25.6%提升至59.8%。

Conclusion: 为LLM智能体配备内部世界模型能更好地对齐推理与环境动态，改善决策能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多层可配置时变马尔可夫决策过程（MCTVMDP），允许智能体通过上层模型改变动作主动修改环境动态，而不仅是被动适应固定环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习假设环境是给定或固定的，但现实中智能体可能具有主动修改环境动态的能力。通过模型改变动作重新配置底层转移过程，可以潜在地提高智能体的奖励。

Method: 引入MCTVMDP框架，包含上层MDP和下层MDP。上层MDP通过模型改变动作配置下层MDP的非平稳转移函数，下层MDP执行原始动作。智能体需要联合优化上层配置策略和下层原始动作策略。

Result: 提出了一个能够处理主动环境修改的强化学习框架，为智能体提供了同时优化环境配置和动作策略的能力。

Conclusion: MCTVMDP框架扩展了传统强化学习的边界，使智能体能够主动修改环境动态，从而可能获得更高的长期奖励。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning usually assumes a given or sometimes even fixed
environment in which an agent seeks an optimal policy to maximize its long-term
discounted reward. In contrast, we consider agents that are not limited to
passive adaptations: they instead have model-changing actions that actively
modify the RL model of world dynamics itself. Reconfiguring the underlying
transition processes can potentially increase the agents' rewards. Motivated by
this setting, we introduce the multi-layer configurable time-varying Markov
decision process (MCTVMDP). In an MCTVMDP, the lower-level MDP has a
non-stationary transition function that is configurable through upper-level
model-changing actions. The agent's objective consists of two parts: Optimize
the configuration policies in the upper-level MDP and optimize the primitive
action policies in the lower-level MDP to jointly improve its expected
long-term reward.

TL;DR: Antislop框架通过三种创新方法检测和消除LLM输出中的重复短语模式：Antislop采样器、自动化分析管道和FTPO微调方法，能显著减少90%的重复模式同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM广泛采用导致输出中出现特征性重复短语（称为"slop"），这降低了输出质量并使AI生成文本容易被识别。

Method: 结合三种创新方法：(1) Antislop采样器使用回溯抑制不需要的字符串；(2) 自动化管道分析模型特定slop并生成训练数据；(3) FTPO微调方法在单个token级别调整logits。

Result: Antislop采样器成功抑制8000+模式，而token禁止在2000模式时就不可用。FTPO实现90% slop减少，同时在GSM8K、MMLU和创意写作任务中保持或提升性能。

Conclusion: Antislop框架能有效检测和消除LLM输出中的重复模式，显著提升输出质量，而DPO方法会导致写作质量和词汇多样性显著下降。

Abstract: Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology,
termed ``slop,'' which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text
immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework
providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a sophisticated additive manufacturing
technology for creating three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nano-structures.
Maintaining the health of TPL systems is critical for ensuring consistent
fabrication quality. Current maintenance practices often rely on experience
rather than informed monitoring of machine health, resulting in either untimely
maintenance that causes machine downtime and poor-quality fabrication, or
unnecessary maintenance that leads to inefficiencies and avoidable downtime. To
address this gap, this paper presents three methods for accurate and timely
monitoring of TPL machine health. Through integrating physics-informed
data-driven predictive models for structure dimensions with statistical
approaches, the proposed methods are able to handle increasingly complex
scenarios featuring different levels of generalizability. A comprehensive
experimental dataset that encompasses six process parameter combinations and
six structure dimensions under two machine health conditions was collected to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Across all test
scenarios, the approaches are shown to achieve high accuracies, demonstrating
excellent effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. These results
represent a significant step toward condition-based maintenance for TPL
systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个在线相关聚类算法，在AOS模型下能同时近似所有ℓp范数目标，将离线的"全范数"保证成功扩展到在线场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于离线相关聚类中可以实现同时近似所有ℓp范数的强大保证，但标准随机顺序在线模型存在根本性分离：ℓ1范数可轻松近似，而公平性目标ℓ∞范数需要Ω(n^{1/3})竞争比，因此需要超越最坏情况的模型。

Method: 提出了一种在线带样本(AOS)模型的单一算法，给定输入的一小部分常数比例作为样本，生成一个聚类，能同时高概率地O(log⁴n)竞争所有ℓp范数，高概率地O(logn)竞争ℓ∞范数，期望下O(1)竞争ℓ1范数。

Result: 算法在AOS模型中实现了：同时O(log⁴n)竞争所有ℓp范数(高概率)，O(logn)竞争ℓ∞范数(高概率)，O(1)竞争ℓ1范数(期望)。证明了标准RO模型中ℓ∞范数需要至少Ω(n^{1/3})竞争比的下界。

Conclusion: 成功将离线的"全范数"保证扩展到在线世界，证明了AOS模型的有效性，并提供了ℓ1和ℓ∞范数竞争比的紧下界，表明所获竞争比在AOS模型中几乎是最优的。

Abstract: The $\ell_p$-norm objectives for correlation clustering present a fundamental
trade-off between minimizing total disagreements (the $\ell_1$-norm) and
ensuring fairness to individual nodes (the $\ell_\infty$-norm). Surprisingly,
in the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all
$\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be
achieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative
answer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model
that, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one
clustering that is simultaneously $O(\log^4 n)$-competitive for all
$\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\log n)$-competitive for the
$\ell_\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the
$\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline
"all-norms" guarantee to the online world.
  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a
fundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order
(RO) online model. Namely, while the $\ell_1$-norm is trivially
$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO
model for the fairness-promoting $\ell_\infty$-norm must have a competitive
ratio of at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. This highlights the necessity of a
different beyond-worst-case model. We complement our algorithm with lower
bounds, showing our competitive ratios for the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-
norms are nearly tight in the AOS model.

Conclusion: TempO通过流匹配和傅里叶层的结合，为高维PDE动力学预测提供了高效且物理一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge
for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches
often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long,
physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative,
enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO
approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging
sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D
spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture
multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further
demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency
studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to
attention-based or convolutional regressors.

TL;DR: 该论文提出DLER方法，通过强化学习结合简单的截断长度惩罚，解决了推理语言模型输出过长的问题，在保持准确率的同时大幅缩短输出长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理语言模型（如OpenAI-o1、DeepSeek-R1等）虽然性能强大，但往往生成不必要的冗长输出。如何最大化每个token的智能（准确率相对于响应长度）是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 使用强化学习结合最简单的长度惩罚——截断，提出DLER训练配方，包括批量奖励归一化、更高裁剪、动态采样和简单的截断长度惩罚。还提出了难度感知DLER和更新选择性合并方法。

Result: DLER实现了最先进的准确率-效率权衡，输出长度减少超过70%，同时超越了所有先前基线的准确率。DLER-7B相比DeepSeek-R1-7B，在并行生成多个简洁响应时准确率提高28%，延迟更低。

Conclusion: DLER方法证明通过适当的强化学习优化，简单的截断长度惩罚就能有效解决语言模型输出冗长问题，在保持准确性的同时显著提高效率。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in
critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator
systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This
research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical
ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from
observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an
understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires
the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses
about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work
introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems
(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories
of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using
evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative
precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery
such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway
toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is
analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before
proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the
data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments
toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using
empirical and game-theoretic elements.

### [29] [A Simple Method for PMF Estimation on Large Supports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15132)
*Alex Shtoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图拉普拉斯算子的非参数概率质量函数估计方法，通过数据依赖的低通滤波处理多模态和重尾分布，计算高效且无需过多调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在大离散支撑集上估计多模态、重尾概率质量函数的问题，传统方法在处理这类分布时效果不佳。

Method: 将经验PMF视为线图上的信号，构建对称三对角算子（路径图拉普拉斯加上经验PMF构建的对角矩阵），计算最小特征值对应的特征向量，将经验PMF投影到低维子空间进行平滑估计。

Result: 在合成和真实重尾数据上，该方法能保持粗粒度结构同时抑制采样噪声，在目标场景下优于logspline和高斯KDE基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现简洁、计算可靠快速，适合自动化流程和大规模探索性分析，但存在已知的失效模式（如突然的不连续性）。

Abstract: We study nonparametric estimation of a probability mass function (PMF) on a
large discrete support, where the PMF is multi-modal and heavy-tailed. The core
idea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a
data-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal
operator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from
the empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest
feq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional
subspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse
structure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and
re-normalizing yields a valid PMF.
  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the
computation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support
times the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a
practical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an
orthogonal-series risk estimate, so the method "just works" with minimal
tuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves
coarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to
logspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes. However, it has
known failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities). The method is short to
implement, robust across sample sizes, and suitable for automated pipelines and
exploratory analysis at scale because of its reliability and speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究恐怖主义事件的短期预测，为GTD事件预测提供透明、可复现的基准参考。

Method: 构建可复现的预测流程，使用固定时间分割评估双向LSTM模型，并与季节性朴素、线性/ARIMA和LSTM-Attention基线进行比较。

Result: 双向LSTM在测试集上RMSE为6.38，比LSTM-Attention提升30.6%，比线性滞后回归基线提升35.4%，在MAE和MAPE指标上也有并行改进。

Conclusion: 长期历史数据训练效果最好，适中的回看窗口（20-30周）提供强上下文，双向编码对捕捉窗口内的累积和后续模式至关重要，短期结构特征贡献最大。

Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using
the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible
pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a
deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE
6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression
baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE.
Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain,
lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical
data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong
context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and
aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that
short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes
most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release
code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement
documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a
transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making
strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch
on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely
successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for
enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.
  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes
learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the
context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy
regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for
continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a
near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the
original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy
learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and
local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical
guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,
addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete
to continuous time settings.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of
continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.

Motivation: 神经网络在训练过程中如何自适应调整内部表示的特征学习机制仍缺乏理论理解，需要建立可处理的数学框架来揭示其工作原理。

Method: 使用统计物理方法推导了双层非线性网络的贝叶斯后验自洽平均场理论，并在有限宽度下分析了对称性破缺相变。

Result: 平均场理论预测了特征学习的相变发生，但低估了泛化性能提升；通过引入自增强输入特征选择机制，理论预测与实验学习曲线实现了定量匹配。

Conclusion: 自增强输入特征选择是特征学习的关键机制，完善的平均场理论能够定量解释神经网络训练过程中的特征学习现象。

Abstract: Feature learning (FL), where neural networks adapt their internal
representations during training, remains poorly understood. Using methods from
statistical physics, we derive a tractable, self-consistent mean-field (MF)
theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). At infinite width, this theory
reduces to kernel ridge regression, but at finite width it predicts a symmetry
breaking phase transition where networks abruptly align with target functions.
While the basic MF theory provides theoretical insight into the emergence of FL
in the finite-width regime, semi-quantitatively predicting the onset of FL with
noise or sample size, it substantially underestimates the improvements in
generalisation after the transition. We trace this discrepancy to a key
mechanism absent from the plain MF description: \textit{self-reinforcing input
feature selection}. Incorporating this mechanism into the MF theory allows us
to quantitatively match the learning curves of SGLD-trained networks and
provides mechanistic insight into FL.

Conclusion: 测地线问题是深度Ritz方法的一个有前景的应用方向，为未来科学机器学习研究提供了富有成果的研究路径。

Abstract: Geodesic problems involve computing trajectories between prescribed initial
and final states to minimize a user-defined measure of distance, cost, or
energy. They arise throughout physics and engineering -- for instance, in
determining optimal paths through complex environments, modeling light
propagation in refractive media, and the study of spacetime trajectories in
control theory and general relativity. Despite their ubiquity, the scientific
machine learning (SciML) community has given relatively little attention to
investigating its methods in the context of these problems. In this work, we
argue that given their simple geometry, variational structure, and natural
nonlinearity, geodesic problems are particularly well-suited for the Deep Ritz
method. We substantiate this claim with three numerical examples drawn from
path planning, optics, and solid mechanics. Our goal is not to provide an
exhaustive study of geodesic problems, but rather to identify a promising
application of the Deep Ritz method and a fruitful direction for future SciML
research.

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段模型，整合临床和影像信息来提高髋部骨折风险预测的准确性，相比传统方法具有更高敏感性和更少的漏诊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工具如DXA T-score和FRAX在髋部骨折风险预测中缺乏敏感性，特别是对于无既往骨折史或骨质疏松前期的个体，需要更准确的风险评估方法。

Method: 采用顺序两阶段模型：第一阶段使用临床、人口统计学和功能变量进行筛查，第二阶段整合DXA衍生特征进行精炼，基于MrOS、SOF和UK Biobank数据集进行验证。

Result: 模型经过内外验证显示一致性能，相比T-score和FRAX实现了更高敏感性和更少的漏诊病例。

Conclusion: 该两阶段框架提供了一种成本效益高且个性化的早期髋部骨折风险评估方法，显著优于传统工具。

Abstract: Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare
burden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment.
However, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack
sensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior
fractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a
sequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to
improve prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men
Study (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,
Stage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to
estimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived
features for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal
and external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across
cohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher
sensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and
personalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design,
traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory
comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for
efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the
NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine
learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in
demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling
approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural
network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and
Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient
dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a
stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training.
The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset
comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a
structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key
components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic
manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and
component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of
the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the
models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity,
demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash
dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve
orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design
exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了表示几何和归一化对基于马氏距离的OOD检测方法性能的影响，提出了径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法，通过控制特征空间的径向几何来显著提升OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然马氏距离方法在OOD检测中被广泛使用，但表示几何和归一化对其性能的影响尚未被充分理解，这限制了其在下游应用中的可靠性。

Method: 进行了全面的实证研究，涵盖多种图像基础模型、数据集和距离归一化方案；定义了数据表示的理想几何，并使用谱和内在维度指标预测模型性能；提出了径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法。

Result: 分析表明马氏距离方法并非普遍可靠；谱和内在维度指标能准确预测OOD性能；径向缩放ℓ2归一化通过控制径向几何显著提升了OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过弥合表示几何、归一化和OOD性能之间的差距，为设计更有效可靠的深度学习模型提供了新见解。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment
of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the
impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not
fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this
gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image
foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our
analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.
Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate
that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a
model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD
performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$
normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization
recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a
tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,
systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly
improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation
geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights
into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循用户指令对于可控性、透明性和安全性至关重要，但现有研究主要关注最终回答的指令遵循，忽略了推理过程的指令遵循。

Method: 构建ReasonIF基准，包含多语言推理、格式控制和长度控制等六类指令提示；评估多个开源LRM；探索多轮推理和推理指令微调两种改进策略。

Result: 现有LRM的推理指令遵循得分普遍低于0.25，任务难度增加时表现更差；推理指令微调将GPT-OSS-20B的得分从0.11提升到0.27。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循指令的能力存在显著不足，推理指令微调能带来改善但仍需大幅提升。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is
central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies
assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is
also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions
throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs
more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable
shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To
evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for
assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of
instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length
control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and
DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:
the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that
fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.
Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades
further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction
fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning
(RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to
0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了针对AdamW优化器的权重衰减缩放规则，解决了μP在稳态训练阶段学习率跨宽度迁移失效的问题，实现了零超参数调优的宽度缩放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代尺度不变架构中，训练快速进入优化器主导的稳态，归一化层导致反向尺度敏感性，使得有效学习率变得宽度依赖，破坏了μP的学习率迁移能力。

Method: 引入权重衰减缩放规则：对于矩阵类参数使用λ₂∝√d，向量类参数使用η₁=Θ_d(1)和λ₁=0，结合μP学习率规则η₂∝d⁻¹，保持子层增益的宽度不变性。

Result: 在LLaMA风格Transformer和最小合成设置中验证了该规则的有效性，提供了匹配顶部奇异值的简单诊断方法，实现了学习率和权重衰减的零样本迁移。

Conclusion: 通过显式控制优化器设定的稳态尺度，将μP扩展到近初始化阶段之外，为AdamW下的宽度鲁棒超参数迁移提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and
compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate
transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in
modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an
optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward
scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,
degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay
scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,
the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width
scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P
learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an
empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that
approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like
parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields
\emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to
target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style
Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple
diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance.
Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling
steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for
width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

Abstract: The 6th Annual Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL 2025),
hosted by the Association for Health Learning and Inference (AHLI), was held in
person on June 25-27, 2025, at the University of California, Berkeley, in
Berkeley, California, USA. As part of this year's program, we hosted Research
Roundtables to catalyze collaborative, small-group dialogue around critical,
timely topics at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare. Each
roundtable was moderated by a team of senior and junior chairs who fostered
open exchange, intellectual curiosity, and inclusive engagement. The sessions
emphasized rigorous discussion of key challenges, exploration of emerging

### [41] [Particle Dynamics for Latent-Variable Energy-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15447)
*Shiqin Tang,Shuxin Zhuang,Rong Feng,Runsheng Yu,Hongzong Li,Youzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于鞍点问题的隐变量能量模型训练方法，通过耦合Wasserstein梯度流进行最大似然训练，无需判别器或辅助网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐变量能量模型能够表达生成建模并捕获隐藏结构，但传统训练方法存在局限性，需要更有效的训练框架。

Method: 将最大似然训练重新表述为潜变量和联合流形分布上的鞍点问题，使用耦合Wasserstein梯度流进行内部更新，交替进行过阻尼Langevin更新和随机参数上升。

Result: 在标准平滑性和耗散性假设下证明了存在性和收敛性，在KL散度和Wasserstein-2距离下具有衰减率，在物理系统数值逼近中表现竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需判别器的隐变量能量模型训练框架，鞍点视角产生了比受限摊销后验更紧的ELBO，在数值实验中表现良好。

Abstract: Latent-variable energy-based models (LVEBMs) assign a single normalized
energy to joint pairs of observed data and latent variables, offering
expressive generative modeling while capturing hidden structure. We recast
maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on the
latent and joint manifolds and view the inner updates as coupled Wasserstein
gradient flows. The resulting algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates
for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic
parameter ascent, requiring no discriminator or auxiliary networks. We prove
existence and convergence under standard smoothness and dissipativity
assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The
saddle-point view further yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds obtained
with restricted amortized posteriors. Our method is evaluated on numerical
approximations of physical systems and performs competitively against
comparable approaches.

*Han Ouyang,Jesse Hamilton,Saeed Amal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于MIMIC-III数据库，使用集成学习方法开发脑膜炎诊断模型，在模拟真实急诊场景下取得了优异的诊断性能（测试集AUC分别达0.9637和0.9472）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够在真实急诊场景下辅助诊断脑膜炎的AI工具，解决临床诊断挑战。

Method: 使用214例脑膜炎患者和46,303例非脑膜炎患者数据，经过数据预处理和两阶段特征选择后，训练随机森林、LightGBM和DNN作为基础模型，然后通过逻辑回归进行模型集成。

Result: 集成学习模型在两个测试集上分别取得了0.9637和0.9472的AUC值，表现出优异的诊断性能。

Conclusion: 虽然直接将诊断工具部署到临床使用仍具挑战，但本研究为未来基于集成学习的AI驱动脑膜炎诊断方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We utilized a cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis
patients from the MIMIC-III database. After extensive data preprocessing, which
included ICD-based cohort selection, one-hot encoding of coding, and a
two-stage feature selection process (for both the training set and the testing
sets), clinically relevant features such as gender and high-risk ICD codes
(including subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain,
and generalized epilepsy) are selected. Overall, these clinically reasonable
and temporally adherent features provided excellent modeling performance. Three
models (Random Forest, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained as
base models for Ensemble Learning. Base model outputs are aggregated and
stacked into a meta model (Logistic Regression) that uses the base model
outputs as input values in training. Ultimately, soldier outputs (AUC of
Testing Set 1: 0.9637, AUC of Testing Set 2: 0.9472) are obtained through
ensemble learning.
  We created a challenging condition for diagnosing meningitis, simulating a
real-world ER (Emergency Room) scenario to enhance clinical use in real-world
applications. While directly deploying a diagnostic tool that clinicians can
use is challenging, this paper paves the way for a potential future AI-driven
diagnostic approach for meningitis using Ensemble Learning.

*Nirmit Joshi,Gene Li,Siddharth Bhandari,Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan,Cong Ma,Nathan Srebro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究从正确演示中学习生成答案的问题，提出了一种不依赖最大似然估计的新方法，在奖励模型属于低基数类的情况下实现对数级样本复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设演示者属于低复杂度策略类，但本文认为奖励模型属于低基数类是一个更弱的假设，需要开发不依赖最大似然估计的新学习方法。

Method: 将问题形式化为上下文赌博机中的离线模仿学习，提出一种新颖方法，利用奖励模型低基数特性，避免最大似然估计的局限性。

Result: 证明最大似然方法在这种情况下会失败，而新方法实现了与奖励类基数对数的样本复杂度。

Conclusion: 在从正确演示中学习时，需要超越最大似然估计的方法，特别是在奖励模型具有低基数特性的场景下。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a
question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of
which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some
correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT).
We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits,
with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed
rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity
policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss
minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model
(specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which
we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods
can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that
learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward
class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning
from correct demonstrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展先前关于使用乘积系数增强3D LiDAR点云分类的研究，探索结合自编码器表示是否能进一步提升性能。

Method: 将乘积系数与自编码器表示相结合，使用KNN分类器，并逐层添加乘积系数来研究其对分类性能的影响。

Result: 逐层添加乘积系数显示出明显趋势：更丰富的系数集合系统性地提高了类别可分性和整体准确率。

Conclusion: 结合分层乘积系数特征与自编码器对于推动LiDAR分类性能具有重要价值。

Abstract: This work extends our previous study on enhancing 3D LiDAR point-cloud
classification with product coefficients
\cite{medina2025integratingproductcoefficientsimproved}, measure-theoretic
descriptors that complement the original spatial Lidar features. Here, we show
that combining product coefficients with an autoencoder representation and a
KNN classifier delivers consistent performance gains over both PCA-based
baselines and our earlier framework. We also investigate the effect of adding
product coefficients level by level, revealing a clear trend: richer sets of
coefficients systematically improve class separability and overall accuracy.
The results highlight the value of combining hierarchical product-coefficient
features with autoencoders to push LiDAR classification performance further.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于信息论的因果推断方法，通过最小化表示与处理变量之间的互信息来消除分配偏差，无需对抗训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在存在分配偏差的情况下进行反事实预测的问题，避免对抗训练的不稳定性和调参负担。

Method: 学习一个随机表示Z来预测结果，同时最小化I(Z;T)，推导出可处理的变分目标上界信息项，并与监督解码器耦合。

Result: 在受控数值模拟和真实临床数据集上评估，在似然度、反事实误差和政策评估指标上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在避免对抗训练不稳定性的同时，在多个评估指标上表现良好，可自然扩展到动态设置。

Abstract: We study counterfactual prediction under assignment bias and propose a
mathematically grounded, information-theoretic approach that removes
treatment-covariate dependence without adversarial training. Starting from a
bound that links the counterfactual-factual risk gap to mutual information, we
learn a stochastic representation Z that is predictive of outcomes while
minimizing I(Z; T). We derive a tractable variational objective that
upper-bounds the information term and couples it with a supervised decoder,
yielding a stable, provably motivated training criterion. The framework extends
naturally to dynamic settings by applying the information penalty to sequential
representations at each decision time. We evaluate the method on controlled
numerical simulations and a real-world clinical dataset, comparing against
recent state-of-the-art balancing, reweighting, and adversarial baselines.
Across metrics of likelihood, counterfactual error, and policy evaluation, our
approach performs favorably while avoiding the training instabilities and
tuning burden of adversarial schemes.

### [46] [Stress-Aware Learning under KL Drift via Trust-Decayed Mirror Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15222)
*Gabriel Nixon Raj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在分布漂移下的顺序决策方法——熵正则化信任衰减，通过应力感知的指数倾斜来更新信念和决策，实现了动态遗憾保证和鲁棒性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在分布漂移环境下的顺序决策问题，传统方法在分布变化时性能下降，需要开发能够适应分布变化的鲁棒算法。

Method: 提出熵正则化信任衰减方法，在信念更新和镜像下降决策中注入应力感知的指数倾斜，建立了Fenchel对偶等价性，并分析了鲁棒性指标如脆弱性、信念带宽和决策空间脆弱性指数。

Result: 证明了高概率敏感性界，在KL漂移路径长度S_T下实现了Õ(√T)的动态遗憾保证，信任衰减实现了O(1)的每切换遗憾，而无应力更新会产生Ω(1)的尾部损失。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了动态遗憾分析、分布鲁棒目标和KL正则化控制，提供了一个应力自适应的更新方法，并扩展到二阶更新、老虎机反馈、异常值处理等多个场景。

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making under distribution drift. We propose
entropy-regularized trust-decay, which injects stress-aware exponential tilting
into both belief updates and mirror-descent decisions. On the simplex, a
Fenchel-dual equivalence shows that belief tilt and decision tilt coincide. We
formalize robustness via fragility (worst-case excess risk in a KL ball),
belief bandwidth (radius sustaining a target excess), and a decision-space
Fragility Index (drift tolerated at $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret). We prove
high-probability sensitivity bounds and establish dynamic-regret guarantees of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ under KL-drift path length $S_T = \sum_{t\ge2}\sqrt{{\rm
KL}(D_t|D_{t-1})/2}$. In particular, trust-decay achieves $O(1)$ per-switch
regret, while stress-free updates incur $\Omega(1)$ tails. A parameter-free
hedge adapts the tilt to unknown drift, whereas persistent over-tilting yields
an $\Omega(\lambda^2 T)$ stationary penalty. We further obtain
calibrated-stress bounds and extensions to second-order updates, bandit
feedback, outliers, stress variation, distributed optimization, and plug-in
KL-drift estimation. The framework unifies dynamic-regret analysis,
distributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control within a single
stress-adaptive update.

TL;DR: 提出了KME-CLIP方法，通过再生核希尔伯特空间的内积来改进CLIP中的相似度计算机制，更好地利用点互信息的线性结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP及其变体未能充分利用点互信息(PMI)的线性结构，而理论研究表明跨模态最优相似度度量应对应PMI。

Method: 提出KME-CLIP方法，在再生核希尔伯特空间中使用内积来近似PMI，理论证明可以达到任意精度。

Result: 在多个检索和分类任务中，KME-CLIP整体优于标准CLIP方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用PMI的线性结构，KME-CLIP能够更有效地计算跨模态相似度，提升多模态对比预训练性能。

Abstract: In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation
mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior
theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics
between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information
(PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP
and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI.
We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner
product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our
method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate
that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across
several retrieval and classification tasks.

TL;DR: FinTrust是一个专门评估金融领域LLM可信度的综合基准，涵盖多个对齐维度，评估发现专有模型在安全性方面表现更好，开源模型在特定公平性方面有优势，但所有模型在法律意识方面都存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于金融领域的高风险和高利害特性，在真实金融应用中部署LLM具有挑战性，需要评估其可信度。

Method: 开发FinTrust基准，基于实际场景设计多个对齐维度的细粒度任务，评估11个LLM模型。

Result: 专有模型如o4-mini在大多数任务（如安全性）中表现更好，开源模型如DeepSeek-V3在特定领域（如行业级公平性）有优势，所有模型在信托责任对齐和披露等挑战性任务中都表现不佳。

Conclusion: FinTrust可以作为金融领域LLM可信度评估的有价值基准，当前LLM在法律意识方面存在显著差距。

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related
problems. However, applying LLMs in real-world finance application remains
challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper
introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark
focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and
features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.
We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a
valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

TL;DR: Chronos-2是一个预训练的时间序列模型，能够以零样本方式处理单变量、多变量和协变量预测任务，通过组注意力机制实现跨序列的上下文学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练时间序列模型主要关注单变量预测，限制了在现实世界多变量数据和协变量场景中的应用。

Method: 采用组注意力机制，通过在合成数据集上训练，将多样化的多变量结构施加于单变量序列，实现跨序列的高效信息共享。

Result: 在fev-bench、GIFT-Eval和Chronos Benchmark II三个基准测试中达到最先进性能，特别是在多变量和协变量预测任务上显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Chronos-2的上下文学习能力使其成为通用预测模型，可直接用于现实世界预测流程。

Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems
that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However,
existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates
play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of
handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in
a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that
facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing
across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related
series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a
forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on
synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate
series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three
comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On
fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,
Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over
existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms
baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains
further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning
capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model
that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TESSERA是一种新颖的不确定性量化方法，通过结合专家混合模型和保形校准，为蛋白质-配体亲和力预测提供可靠、信息丰富且自适应的预测区间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习社区缺乏可靠、信息丰富且个体化的不确定性量化方法，这阻碍了AI/ML在风险敏感领域的有效应用。特别是在药物发现中的蛋白质-配体亲和力预测，面临着异质性噪声、化学空间不平衡和分布偏移等挑战。

Method: TESSERA结合了专家混合模型的多样性和保形校准，提供具有可靠覆盖保证的每样本不确定性、信息丰富且自适应的预测区间宽度，能够追踪绝对误差。

Result: 在i.i.d.和基于支架的OOD分割下，TESSERA实现了接近名义覆盖率和最佳的覆盖-宽度权衡（CWC），同时保持了竞争性的自适应性（最低AUSE）。SSC进一步证实区间大小合适，在数据稀缺或噪声大时宽度增加，预测可靠时保持紧凑。

Conclusion: 通过统一专家混合模型多样性和保形校准，TESSERA提供了可信赖、紧凑且自适应的不确定性，适用于药物发现流程中的选择性预测和下游决策制定。

Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains
missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of
AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage
on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or
assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a
distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity
(PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous,
chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely
involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty
quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled
Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides
per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and
adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate
on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD)
splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal
coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the
Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity
(lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage
(SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width
increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are
reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal
calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties
that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in
the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.

Result: 证明成对偏好数据无法学习相关性信息，而三选一偏好数据能够提供足够的统计信息，提出的算法具有近最优性能。在真实数据集上验证了改进的个性化偏好建模效果。

Conclusion: 高阶偏好数据在建模相关效用方面具有显著优势，能够实现更细粒度的人类偏好建模，提升个性化效果。

Abstract: Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user
preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these
techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption,
which collapses \emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility
function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On
the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding
this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and
computational challenges of learning a \emph{correlated} probit model, a
fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the
classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is
\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information,
explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this
setting. Next, we demonstrate that \emph{best-of-three} preference data
provably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and
computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These
results highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning
correlated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human
preferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several
real-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human
preferences.

Motivation: 强化学习在可验证答案任务上有效扩展思维链推理，但在非可验证的人类偏好任务上仍具挑战且研究不足。

Method: DWRL框架通过实例级错位权重和组级条件偏好分数两个互补权重，近似Bradley-Terry模型的最大似然目标，训练生成式偏好模型先产生思维再预测人类偏好分数。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型规模（Llama3和Qwen2.5）上，DWRL持续优于GPM基线和标量模型，同时产生连贯可解释的思维。

Conclusion: DWRL作为通用框架，将推理增强的偏好学习扩展到可验证任务之外。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven effective at scaling
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with
verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks,
typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and
underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning
(DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning
with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that
preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the
maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an
instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs
misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized)
conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper,
we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models
(GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score.
Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL
consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing
coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a
general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable
tasks.

Conclusion: Transformer架构在禽类疾病监测早期预警系统中具有巨大潜力，能够支持及时干预和预防策略。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of avian disease outbreaks is critical for wildlife
conservation and public health. This study presents a Transformer-based
framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of
migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS
tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for
Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The
raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to
capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from
bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a
held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision
(AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These
results highlight the potential of Transformer architectures to support
early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance, enabling timely

*Yangyang Li*

TL;DR: DRO-InstructZero通过分布鲁棒优化方法改进零样本提示优化，在分布偏移和对抗评估中显著提升性能，实现可靠且可迁移的提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统提示搜索方法在分布偏移和对抗评估中性能下降的问题，因为传统方法只优化单一评估分布下的期望性能，导致提示在不同设置间难以迁移。

Method: 将零样本提示优化建模为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，使用f-散度球定义评估分布周围的模糊集，通过鲁棒采集规则最大化最坏情况期望效用，同时保持贝叶斯搜索的查询效率。

Result: 在形式化重写任务中准确率从61.3%提升至85-90%，代码调试在域偏移下提升约25个百分点，稳定任务如因果推理保持96%以上，改进在不同散度选择和解码温度下保持一致。

Conclusion: DRO-InstructZero将分布鲁棒优化与提示学习相结合，提供了一种即插即用的通用方法，在现实世界不确定性下实现可靠且可迁移的提示对齐。

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.

TL;DR: RIC-TSC框架将因果发现融入时间序列分类，在格陵兰冰上湖演化预测中比相关性基线准确率提升12.59%，展示了因果建模在地球观测中的泛化优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前地球观测模型过度依赖相关性特征，在异质域间迁移性差。因果建模能发现稳定不变的关系，提高分布偏移下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出RIC-TSC框架，使用J-PCMCI+进行区域感知的因果发现，识别区域特定和不变的预测因子及其时间滞后，输入轻量级分类器。

Result: 在两个对比融化季节的1000个手工标记湖泊数据集上，因果模型在分布外评估中比相关性基线准确率最高提升12.59%。

Conclusion: 因果发现不仅是特征选择手段，更是构建可泛化、机制基础的地球表面动态过程模型的途径。

Abstract: Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable,
invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and
generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in
spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely
correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We
propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification
framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence
modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability.
Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave
backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA
meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify
region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in
Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated
predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a
balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt
seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than
correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results
show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a
pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth
surface processes.

Conclusion: 该不确定性感知伪标签框架有效缓解了不可靠伪标签的影响，为半监督回归提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a commonly used paradigm in semi-supervised learning, yet
its application to semi-supervised regression (SSR) remains relatively
under-explored. Unlike classification, where pseudo-labels are discrete and
confidence-based filtering is effective, SSR involves continuous outputs with
heteroscedastic noise, making it challenging to assess pseudo-label
reliability. As a result, naive pseudo-labeling can lead to error accumulation
and overfitting to incorrect labels. To address this, we propose an
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework that dynamically adjusts
pseudo-label influence from a bi-level optimization perspective. By jointly
minimizing empirical risk over all data and optimizing uncertainty estimates to
enhance generalization on labeled data, our method effectively mitigates the
impact of unreliable pseudo-labels. We provide theoretical insights and
extensive experiments to validate our approach across various benchmark SSR
datasets, and the results demonstrate superior robustness and performance
compared to existing methods. Our code is available at

Motivation: 探讨基础模型（如GPT-4和AlphaFold）不仅是加速科学任务，而是正在重新定义科学实践的方式，推动科学范式的根本性转变。

Method: 提出了一个三阶段演化框架：元科学整合、人机混合共创、自主科学发现，并基于此框架回顾了基础模型在当前科学范式中的应用和新兴能力。

Result: 识别了基础模型在科学发现中的风险和未来方向，支持科学界理解基础模型的变革性作用，并促进对科学发现未来的思考。

Conclusion: 基础模型正在催化科学向新范式的过渡，需要科学界深入理解其变革性角色并反思科学发现的未来。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the
landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis
generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more
fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific
methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this
paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific
paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1)
Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional
paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active
collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3)
Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents
capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention.
Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of
FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future
directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to
support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of
FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery. Our project

Result: 在Lorenz系统和非线性海洋波场模拟实验中，新方法比传统EnKF在相同集成规模下获得更高精度，且额外计算成本可忽略

Conclusion: EnKF-FCNN方法能够有效提高数据同化精度，适应性强，可与不同模型和集成方法结合应用

Abstract: Ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) methods have become increasingly
popular due to their inherent ability to address nonlinear dynamic problems.
However, these methods often face a trade-off between analysis accuracy and
computational efficiency, as larger ensemble sizes required for higher accuracy
also lead to greater computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel
machine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
Specifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate
preliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF. A FCNN is then employed to
learn and predict correction terms for these states, thereby mitigating the
performance degradation induced by the limited ensemble size. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments
involving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The
results consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy
than traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible
additional computational cost. Moreover, the EnKF-FCNN method is adaptable to
diverse applications through coupling with different models and the use of
alternative ensemble-based DA methods.

Conclusion: DFCA展示了在动态现实世界去中心化网络中的鲁棒性和实用性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning has emerged as an effective approach for
handling heterogeneous data across clients by partitioning them into clusters
with similar or identical data distributions. However, most existing methods,
including the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), rely on a
central server to coordinate model updates, which creates a bottleneck and a
single point of failure, limiting their applicability in more realistic
decentralized learning settings. In this work, we introduce DFCA, a fully
decentralized clustered FL algorithm that enables clients to collaboratively
train cluster-specific models without central coordination. DFCA uses a
sequential running average to aggregate models from neighbors as updates
arrive, providing a communication-efficient alternative to batch aggregation
while maintaining clustering performance. Our experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and performs
comparably to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, highlighting
its robustness and practicality for dynamic real-world decentralized networks.

Motivation: 传统随机特征模型需要大量特征才能达到良好性能，本文旨在通过数据依赖的采样方案减少所需特征数量，提高模型效率。

Method: 采用数据依赖的杠杆加权采样方案，提出近似核算法来学习加权RFLAF，比较了普通采样和加权采样两种方案。

Result: 通过加权采样，MSE损失情况下的特征数量界限从Ω(1/ε²)改进到~Ω((1/ε)^{1/t})，当Gram矩阵有限秩时甚至达到Ω(1)；Lipschitz损失情况从Ω(1/ε²)改进到~Ω((1/ε²)^{1/t})。实验验证加权RFLAF能用更少特征达到相同性能。

Conclusion: 数据依赖的加权采样方案能显著减少随机特征模型所需特征数量，提高学习效率，理论分析和实验结果一致证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper studies the generalization properties of a recently proposed
kernel method, the Random Feature models with Learnable Activation Functions
(RFLAF). By applying a data-dependent sampling scheme for generating features,
we provide by far the sharpest bounds on the required number of features for
learning RFLAF in both the regression and classification tasks. We provide a
unified theorem that describes the complexity of the feature number $s$, and
discuss the results for the plain sampling scheme and the data-dependent
leverage weighted scheme. Through weighted sampling, the bound on $s$ in the
MSE loss case is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon)^{1/t})$ in general $(t\geq 1)$, and even to
$\Omega(1)$ when the Gram matrix has a finite rank. For the Lipschitz loss
case, the bound is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon^2)^{1/t})$. To learn the weighted RFLAF, we also
propose an algorithm to find an approximate kernel and then apply the leverage
weighted sampling. Empirical results show that the weighted RFLAF achieves the
same performances with a significantly fewer number of features compared to the
plainly sampled RFLAF, validating our theories and the effectiveness of this
method.

Conclusion: MoE架构提供了一个可扩展的统一框架，能够有效同时防御多种图对抗攻击，显著提升了图神经网络的整体安全性。

Abstract: Extensive research has highlighted the vulnerability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to adversarial attacks, including manipulation, node injection, and the
recently emerging threat of backdoor attacks. However, existing defenses
typically focus on a single type of attack, lacking a unified approach to
simultaneously defend against multiple threats. In this work, we leverage the
flexibility of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to design a scalable
and unified framework for defending against backdoor, edge manipulation, and
node injection attacks. Specifically, we propose an MI-based logic diversity
loss to encourage individual experts to focus on distinct neighborhood
structures in their decision processes, thus ensuring a sufficient subset of
experts remains unaffected under perturbations in local structures. Moreover,
we introduce a robustness-aware router that identifies perturbation patterns
and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to corresponding robust experts.
Extensive experiments conducted under various adversarial settings demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves superior robustness against multiple
graph adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: 该工作为序列建模提供了新的算子理论视角，通过谱均值流算法实现了可扩展的生成建模和快速采样。

Abstract: A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent
and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory
views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding
vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked
perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an
operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of
materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as
a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To
overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we
introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core
concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral
decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network
decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows
to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the
continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We
demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets.

Motivation: 现有零样本RL方法（如FB表示）存在表达性不足和离线学习中外推误差导致表示偏差的问题，最终导致次优性能。

Method: 1. 在策略学习中引入行为正则化，将策略优化转化为稳定的样本内学习范式；2. 使用任务条件扩散模型提取策略，生成高质量多模态动作分布；3. 采用表达性注意力架构进行表示建模，捕捉环境动态的复杂关系。

Conclusion: BREEZE通过同时增强学习稳定性、策略提取能力和表示学习质量，有效解决了零样本RL中的关键挑战，为学习预训练的通用策略提供了更可靠的框架。

Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a
new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to
arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward
representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we
empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation
errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning
sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal
performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot
RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that
simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and
representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in
zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable
in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a
task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and
multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE
employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to
capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive
experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best
or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to
prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available

Conclusion: SWFP提供了一种高效算法，能够通过小流块级联微调预训练流，具有训练简单快速、计算内存成本低和可证明稳定性等优势。

Abstract: While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning
complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional
shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their
iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In
this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on
the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a
fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP
decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental
transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO
update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and
ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This
decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows
via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages:
simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and
provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior
adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of ionic conductivity in electrolyte systems is crucial
for advancing numerous scientific and technological applications. While
significant progress has been made, current research faces two fundamental
challenges: (1) the lack of high-quality standardized benchmarks, and (2)
inadequate modeling of geometric structure and intermolecular interactions in
mixture systems. To address these limitations, we first reorganize and enhance
the CALiSol and DiffMix electrolyte datasets by incorporating geometric graph
representations of molecules. We then propose GeoMix, a novel geometry-aware
framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance-an essential but challenging
property for mixture systems. At the heart of GeoMix lies the Geometric
Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module specifically designed for
intermolecular geometric message passing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines (including MLPs, GNNs,
and geometric GNNs) across both datasets, validating the importance of
cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for
accurate property prediction. This work not only establishes new benchmarks for
electrolyte research but also provides a general geometric learning framework
that advances modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical

Abstract: Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling
non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and
adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing
approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency,
particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce
WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method
that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to
capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving
fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving
data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows,
enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data,
eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for
historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show
that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online
forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and
demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our
results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates
achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This
sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming
forecasting applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度Transformer模型带来的训练时间长、推理延迟高以及在资源受限设备上不实用的问题，挑战'越深越好'的传统观念。

Method: 将标准Transformer建模为闭式函数逼近器，通过理论分析发现性能依赖于层间协作而非深度本身。ParaFormer通过并行分支结构实现层间协作，每个新分支进一步减少前序分支的损失，实现渐进逼近。

Result: ParaFormer在实验中优于标准Transformer如ViT，支持高达15.07倍的模型压缩，在GPU部署中比FairScale等并行解决方案快3.30倍，并支持自适应持续学习的模型扩展。

Conclusion: 基于通用逼近定理的闭式Transformer公式不仅解释了'深度信念'，还为设计高效Transformer架构开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The widespread 'deeper is better' philosophy has driven the creation of
architectures like ResNet and Transformer, which achieve high performance by
stacking numerous layers. However, increasing model depth comes with challenges
such as longer training times, higher inference latency, and impracticality on
resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a
shallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both
structure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function
approximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their
performance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,
rather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration
through sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not
inherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential
constraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer
collaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive
approximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from
preceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate
ParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.
Moreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates
model expansion for adaptive continuous learning. Experimental results on
multi-GPU deployment demonstrate that ParaFormer is 3.30x faster than widely
used parallelism solutions such as FairScale. These advancements stem from our
closed-form formulation of Transformers based on the Universal Approximation
Theorem, which not only explains the ``depth belief'' but also opens new
avenues for designing efficient Transformer architectures. Source code:

Abstract: This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be
designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying
perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application
domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The
first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in
ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to
a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not
to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee
is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial
or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over
permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where
various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction
framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise
both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy
learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency
and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE
motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple
diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped
objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing
generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个基于置信度估计的理论框架来分析采样型测试时缩放方法，揭示了自一致性和困惑度方法的关键局限性，并提出了结合两者优势的RPC混合方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管采样型测试时缩放方法在实践中取得了成功，但其理论基础仍未得到充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，为这类方法提供理论分析框架。

Method: 提出了RPC方法，包含两个关键组件：困惑度一致性（结合自一致性和困惑度的优势）和推理剪枝（消除低概率推理路径）。

Result: 在7个基准数据集上的实验表明，RPC在保持与自一致性相当推理性能的同时，不仅提高了置信度可靠性，还将采样成本降低了50%。

Conclusion: RPC通过理论指导的混合方法有效解决了现有采样型测试时缩放方法的局限性，在减少推理错误方面展现出强大潜力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach
within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance
reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during
inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations
remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework
for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the
perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two
dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key
limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while
perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the
estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a
hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key
components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity
Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting
the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while
preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating
low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong
potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning
performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence
reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are
available at https://wnjxyk.github.io/RPC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种将时序逻辑因果图融入概率奖励机的方法，以解决强化学习中稀疏奖励和复杂时序依赖问题，加速策略学习并支持跨环境任务规范迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在稀疏奖励和复杂时序依赖任务中表现不佳，概率奖励机虽然能捕捉这些依赖关系但难以手工设计和修改，限制了利用高层因果知识和跨环境迁移的能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效利用因果信息改进概率奖励机，显著提升强化学习在复杂时序依赖任务中的性能，并支持任务规范在不同环境间的迁移。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal
policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex
sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are
finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward
signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms
can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain
difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult
tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and
transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal
structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information
in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism,
thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task
specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its
strengths empirically.

TL;DR: OffSim是一个基于模型的离线逆强化学习框架，直接从专家轨迹中学习环境动态和奖励函数，无需真实环境交互即可训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要预定义模拟器和奖励函数，这通常耗时费力。OffSim旨在直接从专家轨迹中学习这些组件，减少人工设计成本。

Method: 联合优化高熵转移模型和IRL奖励函数，通过OffSim+扩展支持多数据集设置，引入边际奖励增强探索能力。

Result: 在MuJoCo实验中，OffSim相比现有离线IRL方法取得了显著性能提升，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OffSim框架能够有效从专家轨迹中学习环境动态和奖励结构，为离线强化学习提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator
(i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training.
Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is
often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an
Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward
structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim
jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward
function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned
reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a
policy offline without further interaction with the real environment.
Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a
marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive
MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance
gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and
robustness.

TL;DR: 提出SESA框架，通过顺序采样生成多样化解决方案草图，解决RL在语言模型中探索不足和熵崩溃问题，显著提升多样性和性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在提升大语言模型推理能力时存在探索有限和熵崩溃问题，模型倾向于利用狭窄的解决方案集，导致采样多样性丧失，阻碍性能进一步改进

Method: SESA顺序采样框架，首先生成多样化的解决方案草图，然后将其扩展为完整的推理路径，通过条件化每个新输出于先前输出，促进整个过程的多样性

Result: 在合成任务中，顺序采样在路径多样性和崩溃恢复方面始终优于传统RL方法；在三个智能体基准测试中，成功率分别提升+0.25、+0.42和+0.07绝对点（相对基线RL最高提升211%）

Conclusion: SESA为探索提供了一种结构化方法，为RL训练的语言模型实现更有效和多样化的推理铺平了道路

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited
exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of
solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing
RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel
sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution,
potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose
SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by
generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into
full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning
each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process
and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that
sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of
path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world
tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies
and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts
success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up
to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring
its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to
exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in
RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了Transformer语言模型在将离散输入序列映射到连续表示时是单射的，即不同输入不会映射到相同输出，并提出了首个能有效从隐藏激活中重建原始文本的算法SipIt。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即Transformer组件如非线性激活和归一化是非单射的，可能导致不同输入映射到相同输出，从而无法从模型表示中精确恢复输入。

Method: 首先从数学上证明Transformer语言模型在初始化和训练过程中保持单射性；其次在6个最先进语言模型上进行数十亿次碰撞测试；最后提出SipIt算法，能在线性时间内从隐藏激活中重建原始文本。

Result: 数学证明和实证测试均表明Transformer语言模型是单射的，未观察到任何碰撞；SipIt算法在实践中实现了精确可逆性。

Conclusion: 单射性是语言模型的基本且可利用属性，对透明度、可解释性和安全部署具有直接意义。

Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are
inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the
same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's
representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove
mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input
sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are
injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and
preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through
billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and
observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce
SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact
input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and
demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes
injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with
direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

Motivation: 研究知识蒸馏在第三个维度——数据集大小上的表现，探索蒸馏机制中可能被忽视的关键变量。

Method: 在广泛的数据集、任务和神经网络架构上进行实验套件测试，分析建模因素如目标函数、规模和相对样本数的影响。

Result: 蒸馏效果在低数据量场景下不仅保持而且被放大，数据集大小可能是蒸馏机制中基础但被忽视的变量。

Conclusion: 数据集大小是理解知识蒸馏机制的一个基本变量，这一发现为蒸馏理论提供了新的视角和证据。

Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a
student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep
learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works.
Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and
generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension:
dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of
datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of
distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call
this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped
with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of
KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that
distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence
in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of
modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples
on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size
may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning
distillation.

shown promising results for tasks like spatiotemporal volume visualization and
super-resolution. Inspired by these successes, we develop compressed neural
representations for multivariate datasets containing tens to hundreds of

all data variables simultaneously through parameter sharing. This allows us to
achieve state-of-the-art data compression. Through comprehensive evaluations,
we demonstrate superior performance in terms of reconstructed data quality,
rendering and visualization quality, preservation of dependency information
among variables, and storage efficiency.

TL;DR: MC Dropout不确定性在脑肿瘤MRI分割中与分割错误的相关性很弱，特别是在肿瘤边界区域，表明该方法在定位边界错误方面效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然MC Dropout被广泛用于估计模型不确定性，但其在识别分割错误（特别是肿瘤边界附近）方面的有效性尚不明确。

Method: 使用U-Net在四种数据增强设置下进行2D脑肿瘤MRI分割，通过50次随机前向传播计算不确定性，并使用Pearson和Spearman系数与像素级错误进行相关性分析。

Result: 结果显示全局相关性较弱（r≈0.30-0.38），边界相关性可忽略（|r|<0.05）。不同增强设置间的差异虽然统计显著但缺乏实际意义。

Conclusion: MC Dropout不确定性在定位边界错误方面提供的线索有限，强调了在医学图像分割中需要替代或混合不确定性估计方法。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to
estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation
errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study
empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and
segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained
under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling.
Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with
pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak
global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary
correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were
statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These
findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary
error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty
estimation methods in medical image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由战略代理行为引起的内生治疗分配问题，在保持双重稳健性的同时纳入战略考量。

Method: 整合战略均衡建模与双重稳健估计，在战略无混杂性假设下进行理论分析。

Result: 实证评估显示SDR优于基线方法，在不同战略强度下实现7.6%-29.3%的偏差减少，并在代理群体规模扩大时保持稳健可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架为代理对干预做出战略响应时的可靠因果推断提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Strategic Doubly Robust (SDR) estimator, a novel framework
that integrates strategic equilibrium modeling with doubly robust estimation
for causal inference in strategic environments. SDR addresses endogenous
treatment assignment arising from strategic agent behavior, maintaining double
robustness while incorporating strategic considerations. Theoretical analysis
confirms SDR's consistency and asymptotic normality under strategic
unconfoundedness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate SDR's superior performance
over baseline methods, achieving 7.6\%-29.3\% bias reduction across varying
strategic strengths and maintaining robust scalability with agent populations.
The framework provides a principled approach for reliable causal inference when
agents respond strategically to interventions.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了神经特征假设(NFA)的理论分析，证明了在多层线性网络中NFA的指数与网络深度相关(α=1/L)，并研究了不平衡初始化和权重衰减的影响，同时提供了非线性激活函数的反例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解特征学习是建立深度神经网络数学基础的重要问题。神经特征假设(NFA)描述了训练后网络第一层权重Gram矩阵与输入梯度外积平均值(AGOP)之间的幂律关系，需要进一步研究其在不同网络架构和训练条件下的有效性。

Method: 使用梯度流动力学和平衡权重初始化假设，分析多层线性网络中的NFA性质。通过理论证明和数值实验验证，涵盖不同优化算法、权重衰减率和初始化方案。

Result: 证明了对于L≥2层的线性网络，NFA在整个训练过程中成立且指数α=1/L，显示NFA具有深度依赖性。对于不平衡初始化，在应用权重衰减时NFA渐近成立。同时发现某些非线性激活函数网络即使完美拟合训练数据，NFA也不成立。

Conclusion: NFA在多层线性网络中成立且深度依赖，权重衰减有助于不平衡初始化下的NFA成立，但非线性激活可能破坏NFA，表明特征学习机制在不同网络架构中存在差异。

Abstract: Understanding feature learning is an important open question in establishing
a mathematical foundation for deep neural networks. The Neural Feature Ansatz
(NFA) states that after training, the Gram matrix of the first-layer weights of
a deep neural network is proportional to some power $\alpha>0$ of the average
gradient outer product (AGOP) of this network with respect to its inputs.
Assuming gradient flow dynamics with balanced weight initialization, the NFA
was proven to hold throughout training for two-layer linear networks with
exponent $\alpha = 1/2$ (Radhakrishnan et al., 2024). We extend this result to
networks with $L \geq 2$ layers, showing that the NFA holds with exponent
$\alpha = 1/L$, thus demonstrating a depth dependency of the NFA. Furthermore,
we prove that for unbalanced initialization, the NFA holds asymptotically
through training if weight decay is applied. We also provide counterexamples
showing that the NFA does not hold for some network architectures with
nonlinear activations, even when these networks fit arbitrarily well the
training data. We thoroughly validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments across a variety of optimization algorithms, weight decay rates and
initialization schemes.

Motivation: 受迭代联合图传播(IJGP)算法启发，旨在通过神经网络方法改进#SAT问题的求解准确性。

Method: 使用树分解将CNF公式编码为联合图，在图上进行迭代消息传递，通过学习划分函数来近似模型数量，并应用簇内和簇间的注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明Attn-JGNN模型比其他神经网络方法取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: 注意力机制使模型更关注概率推理中的关键变量和簇，减少了冗余计算，从而提高了#SAT问题的求解精度。

Abstract: We propose an Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks(Attn-JGNN) model
for solving #SAT problems, which significantly improves the solving accuracy.
Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN
uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then
performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates
the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve
the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between
clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the
key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the
redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model
achieves better results than other neural network methods.

TL;DR: GRATING是一个无需训练的推理系统，通过渐进式聚类剪枝和内存优化技术，显著降低交叉编码器重排序器的延迟和内存使用，在保持精度的同时提升边缘设备上AI服务的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义top-K选择在边缘AI服务中占据主导地位，但其延迟和内存需求在边缘硬件上成为瓶颈。研究发现只有相对排名重要而非精确分数，且中间层存在序列级稀疏性，为剪枝提供了机会。

Method: 提出整体前向传播和GRATING系统，通过全局候选视图进行渐进式聚类剪枝，采用双层滑动窗口和分块执行策略重叠I/O与计算，限制峰值内存使用。

Result: 在0.6B到8B参数的重排序器上，GRATING在Apple M2和RTX 5070上相比最先进基线，微基准测试中延迟降低达89.0%，峰值内存减少达94.9%，精度无损失。在三个真实世界应用中，延迟降低11.6%-51.0%，峰值内存减少18.6%-77.8%。

Conclusion: GRATING通过利用相对排名重要性和序列级稀疏性，显著提升了边缘设备上AI服务的效率和可部署性，为检索增强生成、智能体记忆和个性化推荐等应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers underpins of on-device
AI services, such as retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and
personalized recommendation. However, its latency and memory demands dominate
end-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K
selection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact
per-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative
rankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities
prior to completing full inference.
  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a
training-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all
candidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also
bounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via
dual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against
state-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple
M2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak
memory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision. Across
three real-world on-device AI applications, GRATING lowers latency by
11.6%-51.0% and peak memory by 18.6%-77.8%, demonstrating substantial
improvements in efficiency and deployability.

Motivation: 现有的神经和神经符号复杂查询回答方法大多是黑盒模型，缺乏用户信任。虽然神经符号方法如CQD允许跟踪中间结果，但无法解释查询不同部分的重要性。

Method: 基于合作博弈论中的Shapley值，构建CQD-SHAP框架，计算查询各部分对答案排名的贡献，满足所有基本Shapley公理。

Result: 在必要性和充分性解释方面的自动化评估显示，该方法对大多数查询类型都有效，优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: CQD-SHAP成功量化了神经预测器从不完整知识图谱中推断新知识的价值，相比仅依赖现有事实的符号方法提供了更好的解释性。

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction
task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning
over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic
CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be
regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust.
Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable,
allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts
of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel
framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a
specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural
predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a
symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is
formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies
all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations
in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various
baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing
efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in
the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal
dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper
introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network
framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework
adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an
encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing
latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical
spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is
investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to
incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs
significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical
efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical
experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction
capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's
flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to
generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a
scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的Tsetlin机器软件实现，通过位运算、提前退出机制和字面量重排序策略，在ARM处理器上实现高达96.71%的推理时间减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tsetlin机器在资源受限设备上具有高速推理潜力，其逻辑驱动操作适合在现代CPU架构上并行执行。

Method: 利用指令级位运算进行紧凑模型表示和加速处理；引入基于AND子句评估的提前退出机制；提出字面量重排序策略以最大化提前退出可能性。

Result: 在ARM处理器上的实验显示，优化实现相比传统整数型TM实现减少推理时间达96.71%，同时保持可比的代码密度。

Conclusion: 所提出的优化方法显著提升了Tsetlin机器的推理效率，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers high-speed inference on resource-constrained
devices such as CPUs. Its logic-driven operations naturally lend themselves to
parallel execution on modern CPU architectures. Motivated by this, we propose
an efficient software implementation of the TM by leveraging instruction-level
bitwise operations for compact model representation and accelerated processing.
To further improve inference speed, we introduce an early exit mechanism, which
exploits the TM's AND-based clause evaluation to avoid unnecessary
computations. Building upon this, we propose a literal Reorder strategy
designed to maximize the likelihood of early exits. This strategy is applied
during a post-training, pre-inference stage through statistical analysis of all
literals and the corresponding actions of their associated Tsetlin Automata
(TA), introducing negligible runtime overhead. Experimental results using the
gem5 simulator with an ARM processor show that our optimized implementation
reduces inference time by up to 96.71% compared to the conventional
integer-based TM implementations while maintaining comparable code density.

TL;DR: 提出WARP-LUTs方法，通过Walsh辅助松弛技术高效学习逻辑门组合，比DLGNs收敛更快且参数更少，在CIFAR-10上保持可比精度，有望扩展到更高输入逻辑块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有乘法自由模型如DLGNs在训练时计算成本高，且对多输入逻辑块泛化能力差，需要更高效的梯度学习方法。

Method: 使用Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables (WARP-LUTs)方法，基于梯度的逻辑门组合学习，大幅减少可训练参数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上比DLGNs收敛显著更快，同时保持可比精度，参数数量大幅减少。

Conclusion: WARP-LUTs为高效机器学习提供了有前景的方法，具有扩展到更高输入逻辑块的潜力，适合现代FPGA部署和实时科学应用。

Abstract: Fast and efficient machine learning is of growing interest to the scientific
community and has spurred significant research into novel model architectures
and hardware-aware design. Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have
demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models.
Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a
gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic
gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage,
and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during
training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this
work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables
(WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns
combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We
demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10
compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our
approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks,
motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs
and its real-time science applications.

*Yung-Chen Tang,Pin-Yu Chen,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CarBoN是一个测试时校准框架，通过自适应调整模型参数来提升推理性能，无需重新训练大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法（如Best-of-N采样）在N增加时收益递减，效率低下。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：先探索解空间，然后通过学习输入特定的温度T和偏移向量δ来校准logits，引导生成更可靠的推理路径。

Result: 在MATH-500和AIME-2024上的实验显示，CarBoN效率提升4倍，在相同准确率下需要更少的采样次数，且在固定预算下通常能达到更高准确率。

Conclusion: CarBoN框架有效提升了测试时推理效率，T和δ在平衡输出多样性和正确性方面发挥互补作用，该框架可泛化到束搜索等步级采样策略。

Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling)
improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However,
popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$
increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time
calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward
reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of
expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM)
retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$),
a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a
calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive
shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning.
Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency,
with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often
achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the
complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and
correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level
sampling strategies such as beam search. For more information, please refer to

TL;DR: 使用机器学习方法基于电磁参数对IPMSM转子形状（2D型、V型、Nabla型）进行分类，作为传统有限元分析的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法分析转子形状计算成本高，需要开发快速、经济高效的替代方案来加速电机设计过程。

Method: 使用自定义深度学习模型KS-Net与多种传统算法（Cubic SVM、Quadratic SVM等）进行比较，在包含9,000个样本的平衡数据集上采用10折交叉验证。

Result: Cubic SVM和Quadratic SVM算法达到100%准确率，KS-Net模型达到99.98%准确率（仅2个误分类），与传统方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可以高精度预测IPMSM转子形状，为加速电机设计、开发自动转子识别系统和数据驱动故障诊断提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems
has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by
rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using
the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This
study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs
using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to
demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical
methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by
the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine
KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of
9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The
results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all
samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved
99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness
with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be
predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and
cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid
foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor
identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering
applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了约束对抗扰动(CAP)方法，通过增强拉格朗日最小最大优化在约束特征空间中生成通用对抗扰动，解决了现有方法忽略领域特定约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用对抗扰动方法忽略了领域特定的特征关系约束，如金融中的债务收入比或网络通信中的数据包流不变量，这导致生成的对抗样本不切实际或容易被检测，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出约束对抗扰动(CAP)算法，使用基于梯度的交替优化策略解决增强拉格朗日最小最大优化问题，能够强制执行多个复杂程度和重要性不同的约束。

Result: 在金融、IT网络和网络物理系统等多个领域评估显示，CAP实现了更高的攻击成功率，同时显著减少了运行时间，且在个体对抗扰动上也表现出类似的强性能提升。

Conclusion: CAP方法成功地将通用对抗攻击扩展到约束特征空间，并提出从数据中学习特征约束的原则性程序，为具有结构化输入空间的领域提供了广泛适用性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of
classification tasks. However, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial
examples - inputs that are subtly perturbed to induce misclassification while
appearing unchanged to humans. Among various attack strategies, Universal
Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for both
stress testing model robustness and facilitating scalable adversarial training.
Despite their effectiveness, most existing UAP methods neglect domain specific
constraints that govern feature relationships. Violating such constraints, such
as debt to income ratios in credit scoring or packet flow invariants in network
communication, can render adversarial examples implausible or easily
detectable, thereby limiting their real world applicability.
  In this work, we advance universal adversarial attacks to constrained feature
spaces by formulating an augmented Lagrangian based min max optimization
problem that enforces multiple, potentially complex constraints of varying
importance. We propose Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP), an efficient
algorithm that solves this problem using a gradient based alternating
optimization strategy. We evaluate CAP across diverse domains including
finance, IT networks, and cyber physical systems, and demonstrate that it
achieves higher attack success rates while significantly reducing runtime
compared to existing baselines. Our approach also generalizes seamlessly to
individual adversarial perturbations, where we observe similar strong
performance gains. Finally, we introduce a principled procedure for learning
feature constraints directly from data, enabling broad applicability across
domains with structured input spaces.

TL;DR: ProofOptimizer是一个通过专家迭代和强化学习训练的模型，能够自动简化Lean证明，无需人工监督，显著压缩证明长度并提升验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经定理证明生成的证明过长，难以理解，限制了数学洞察力，而现有的简化方法在处理长证明时效果不佳，且缺乏训练数据。

Method: 使用专家迭代和强化学习训练ProofOptimizer模型，利用Lean验证简化并提供训练信号，在推理时采用迭代证明缩短工作流程。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ProofOptimizer显著压缩了证明长度：miniF2F减少87%，PutnamBench减少57%，IMO 2025证明减少49%，同时提升了Lean验证速度和下游证明器性能。

Conclusion: ProofOptimizer有效解决了证明简化问题，通过自动化方法显著压缩证明长度，提升验证效率，并可作为训练数据改善下游证明器性能。

Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO
gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of
lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like
Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend
and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is
therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,
and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --
struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We
introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean
proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is
trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify
simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates
within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof
length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs
generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,
reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on
Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check
faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as
training data for supervised finetuning.

TL;DR: ProSh是一种基于风险增强的概率屏蔽模型无关安全强化学习算法，通过在学习过程中应用屏蔽机制来确保动作的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习系统的安全性是重要关注点，需要开发既能优化性能又能提供正式安全保证的系统。

Method: 通过风险预算增强约束MDP状态空间，使用学习到的成本评论器对智能体策略分布应用屏蔽，确保所有采样动作在期望上保持安全。

Result: 在确定性环境中保持最优性，提供仅依赖于备份评论器精度的成本期望紧上界，实验表明在温和假设下训练时也能保证安全。

Conclusion: ProSh是一种有效的模型无关安全强化学习方法，能够在训练和部署阶段提供正式的安全保证。

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at
developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to
deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we
introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free
algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh
augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety
by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost
critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.
We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is
deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the
knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight
upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic
accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically
achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown
in the experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自动机反馈的强化学习方法，用DFA生成的轨迹偏好替代显式奖励函数，无需手动设计奖励，在具有时序依赖的任务中优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在处理具有复杂历史依赖奖励结构的环境时面临挑战，需要手动设计奖励函数，过程繁琐且容易出错。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机(DFA)生成轨迹偏好来学习奖励函数，包含静态方法（直接使用学习到的奖励函数进行策略优化）和动态方法（通过迭代更新持续优化奖励函数和策略）。

Result: 在离散和连续环境中的实验表明，该方法能够学习处理时序依赖任务的有效策略，优于传统奖励工程和基于自动机的基线方法（如奖励机器和LTL引导方法）。

Conclusion: 基于自动机的偏好方法在处理非马尔可夫奖励方面具有优势，提供了可扩展、高效且无需人工干预的奖励建模替代方案，并提供了收敛性保证。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent
reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to
guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with
preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike
conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our
method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over
trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for
manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses
the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic
approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy
through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that
our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with
temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and
automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our
results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling
non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent
alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence
guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided
preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to
the true non-Markovian objective.

Motivation: 有限元分析计算成本高，不适合设计优化问题，需要开发准确且高效的深度学习替代模型来模拟FEA。

Method: 采用图神经网络(GNNs)和3D U-Nets作为FEA替代模型，引入基于Navier-Cauchy方程的物理信息神经网络(PINN)框架，并使用课程学习策略（先数据预训练，后物理信息微调）来稳定训练。

Result: GNNs明显优于U-Net，最差的GCN框架相对L2误差为8.7%，而最佳U-Net为13.0%。MPNN和图变换器表现最佳，相对L2误差分别为3.5%和2.6%。PINN将误差最多降低11.3%。图变换器最准确但推理速度比MPNN PINN慢37.5%。

Conclusion: PINN增强的MPNN(MPNN PINN)提供了最实用的解决方案，在预测性能、模型大小和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the product
design lifecycle, the analysis is computationally expensive, making it
unsuitable for many design optimization problems. The deep learning models can
be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA
with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA
of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.
Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on
data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing
training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even
the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error
of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism
trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based
architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph
Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of
3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN)
significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on
high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it
is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN
PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution.
It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and
inference speed.

Motivation: 现有持续学习方法主要关注减轻遗忘和提高准确率，但忽视了网络校准的重要性。神经崩溃现象在持续学习中具有优势，但很少有工作致力于改进持续模型的校准以实现更可靠的预测。

Method: 提出Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)，一种针对神经崩溃方法的自适应混合策略。该方法根据神经崩溃下特征空间的几何特性调整混合过程，确保更稳健的正则化和对齐。

Result: 实验表明SAMix显著提升了性能，在持续学习中超越了最先进方法，同时改进了模型校准。提高了跨任务准确率和预测的可靠性。

Conclusion: SAMix是持续学习系统的一个有前景的进展，能够同时增强准确性和预测的可靠性。

Abstract: While most continual learning methods focus on mitigating forgetting and
improving accuracy, they often overlook the critical aspect of network
calibration, despite its importance. Neural collapse, a phenomenon where
last-layer features collapse to their class means, has demonstrated advantages
in continual learning by reducing feature-classifier misalignment. Few works
aim to improve the calibration of continual models for more reliable
predictions. Our work goes a step further by proposing a novel method that not
only enhances calibration but also improves performance by reducing
overconfidence, mitigating forgetting, and increasing accuracy. We introduce
Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix), an adaptive mixup strategy tailored for neural
collapse-based methods. SAMix adapts the mixing process to the geometric
properties of feature spaces under neural collapse, ensuring more robust
regularization and alignment. Experiments show that SAMix significantly boosts
performance, surpassing SOTA methods in continual learning while also improving
model calibration. SAMix enhances both across-task accuracy and the broader
reliability of predictions, making it a promising advancement for robust
continual learning systems.

Abstract: Poultry farming faces increasing pressure to meet productivity targets while
ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and
medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring
and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This
paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular,
cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera
Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time
Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation
Module.
  Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for
full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring
module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding
data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time
notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to
automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed
consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates
forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.
  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,
and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and
optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on
Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.
PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide
intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and
profitability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现DiLoCo优化器的有效性主要来自于对伪梯度应用Nesterov动量，提出了Step-K Nesterov Outer Optimizer (SNOO)方法，在非分布式设置中实现了1.5-2.5倍的计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展需要更高效的优化技术，Lookahead系列优化器的两循环框架通过维护快速和慢速权重集来提升训练效率。

Method: 提出SNOO方法，在Lookahead框架中对伪梯度应用Nesterov动量，这种方法计算和内存开销小，且与模型分片兼容。

Result: SNOO在非分布式设置中实现了1.5-2.5倍的计算效率提升，且模型规模越大改进效果越明显，最高达到1e23训练FLOPs规模。

Conclusion: SNOO因其最小的计算和内存开销以及与模型分片的兼容性，成为各种内部优化器（包括AdamW和Muon）的实用增强方法。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand
for more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family
of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of
model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a
trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights.
DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies
Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers,
claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we
empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from
applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a
non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov
Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains
of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23
training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its
minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO
is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW
and Muon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子设备受噪声影响，可靠性降低。传统方法依赖间接指标如电路深度或门数量，无法直接优化过程保真度

Method: 提出FIDDLE学习框架，包含高斯过程代理模型用于有限样本下的保真度估计，以及强化学习模块用于路由优化

Conclusion: FIDDLE是首个直接最大化过程保真度的路由优化方法，在量子计算可靠性提升方面具有重要价值

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like quantum
optimization and quantum machine learning. However, current quantum devices are
hindered by noise, reducing their reliability. A key challenge in gate-based
quantum computing is improving the reliability of quantum circuits, measured by
process fidelity, during the transpilation process, particularly in the routing
stage. In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage
(FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two
modules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity
with limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize
routing. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity,
outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit
depth or gate count. We rigorously evaluate FIDDLE by comparing it with
state-of-the-art fidelity estimation techniques and routing optimization
methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed surrogate model is able to
provide a better estimation on the process fidelity compared to existing
learning techniques, and our end-to-end framework significantly improves the
process fidelity of quantum circuits across various noise models.

*Vikash Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRON是一种新颖的神经网络架构，利用物种间的同源关系进行跨物种迁移学习，通过物种转换层将源物种的基因表达映射到目标物种基因空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨物种迁移学习问题，利用生物学的同源关系指导知识迁移，提高转录组数据的有效利用。

Method: 在预训练的前馈神经网络前添加物种转换层，该层的权重由物种间二分图的邻接矩阵掩码，学习源物种到目标物种基因表达的线性变换。

Result: TRON提供了一种生物学基础且可解释的跨物种迁移学习方法，转换层的权重可用于解释功能同源性。

Conclusion: TRON为跨物种迁移学习提供了新途径，目前正在收集跨物种转录组/表型数据进行实验验证。

Abstract: We present Transfer Orthology Networks (TRON), a novel neural network
architecture designed for cross-species transfer learning. TRON leverages
orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to
guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion
layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite
graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype
from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient
transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation
that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space.
The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for
interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across
species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically
grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving
the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are
in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to
gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.

*Michael Klamkin,Mathieu Tanneau,Pascal Van Hentenryck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合求解器，结合优化代理和经典求解器，通过对偶理论保证预测的最优性差距，在无法认证最优性时回退到经典求解器，实现了1000倍以上的加速同时保证最大2%的最优性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化代理虽然平均最优性差距低于1%，但存在最坏情况下差距过大的问题，难以在实际中信任预测结果，需要在经典求解器和优化代理之间找到平衡以实现可信部署。

Method: 提出混合求解器，利用对偶理论高效地界定预测的最优性差距边界，对于无法认证最优性的查询回退到经典求解器；并提出结合原始和对偶代理训练的替代训练程序以提高混合求解器的加速效果。

Result: 在大规模输电系统上的实验表明，混合求解器具有高度可扩展性，相比并行化单纯形求解器实现了1000倍以上的加速，同时保证最大2%的最优性差距。

Conclusion: 该混合求解器在经典求解器和优化代理之间取得了良好平衡，实现了可解释的速度-最优性权衡，为优化代理的可信部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high
fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems.
However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that
result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to
trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance
between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable
trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on
a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid
solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of
predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality
cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the
paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and
dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that
the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves
speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while
guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.

### [100] [From Universal Approximation Theorem to Tropical Geometry of Multi-Layer Perceptrons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15012)
*Yi-Shan Chu,Yueh-Cheng Kuo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文通过热带几何视角重新审视通用逼近定理，提出了一种构造性的、几何感知的sigmoid多层感知器初始化方法，使决策边界在初始化时就能对齐预设形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将热带几何视角与平滑MLPs建立实用桥梁，实现可解释的、形状驱动的初始化，无需依赖ReLU架构。

Method: 设计纯sigmoid MLPs，使其遵循UAT的有限和格式：仿射函数的移位和缩放sigmoid的有限线性组合。利用热带几何显示ReLU网络具有热带有理数（热带多项式的差）的组合结构。

Result: 所得模型在初始化时就能产生与预设形状对齐的决策边界，可通过标准训练进一步优化。

Conclusion: 为热带几何视角与平滑MLPs之间建立了实用桥梁，实现了无需ReLU架构的可解释形状驱动初始化。目前聚焦二维构造和实证演示，理论分析和高维扩展留待未来工作。

Abstract: We revisit the Universal Approximation Theorem(UAT) through the lens of the
tropical geometry of neural networks and introduce a constructive,
geometry-aware initialization for sigmoidal multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).
Tropical geometry shows that Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks admit
decision functions with a combinatorial structure often described as a tropical
rational, namely a difference of tropical polynomials. Focusing on planar
binary classification, we design purely sigmoidal MLPs that adhere to the
finite-sum format of UAT: a finite linear combination of shifted and scaled
sigmoids of affine functions. The resulting models yield decision boundaries
that already align with prescribed shapes at initialization and can be refined
by standard training if desired. This provides a practical bridge between the
tropical perspective and smooth MLPs, enabling interpretable, shape-driven
initialization without resorting to ReLU architectures. We focus on the
construction and empirical demonstrations in two dimensions; theoretical
analysis and higher-dimensional extensions are left for future work.

### [101] [Reliable data clustering with Bayesian community detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15013)
*Magnus Neuman,Jelena Smiljanić,Martin Rosvall*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出使用贝叶斯社区检测方法（DCSBM和Regularized Map Equation）替代传统聚类方法，通过最小描述长度原理进行模型选择，在噪声环境下更可靠地检测模块结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法（如层次聚类、k-means、WGCNA）缺乏原则性模型选择，容易受噪声影响，而常用的稀疏化预处理会引入任意阈值，导致结果不可靠。

Method: 采用基于最小描述长度原理的两种贝叶斯社区检测方法：度校正随机块模型（DCSBM）和正则化地图方程，将稀疏化和聚类统一在原则性框架下。

Result: 在合成数据中，新方法在高噪声条件下仍能检测到植入的聚类，且需要更少样本；在基因共表达数据中，正则化地图方程比WGCNA识别出更稳健且功能一致的基因模块。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯社区检测为跨领域高维数据中的模块结构发现提供了一个原则性且抗噪声的框架。

Abstract: From neuroscience and genomics to systems biology and ecology, researchers
rely on clustering similarity data to uncover modular structure. Yet widely
used clustering methods, such as hierarchical clustering, k-means, and WGCNA,
lack principled model selection, leaving them susceptible to noise. A common
workaround sparsifies a correlation matrix representation to remove noise
before clustering, but this extra step introduces arbitrary thresholds that can
distort the structure and lead to unreliable results. To detect reliable
clusters, we capitalize on recent advances in network science to unite
sparsification and clustering with principled model selection. We test two
Bayesian community detection methods, the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block
Model and the Regularized Map Equation, both grounded in the Minimum
Description Length principle for model selection. In synthetic data, they
outperform traditional approaches, detecting planted clusters under high-noise
conditions and with fewer samples. Compared to WGCNA on gene co-expression
data, the Regularized Map Equation identifies more robust and functionally
coherent gene modules. Our results establish Bayesian community detection as a
principled and noise-resistant framework for uncovering modular structure in
high-dimensional data across fields.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于高斯过程状态空间模型(GPSSM)的递归学习方法，通过异构多输出核、诱导点管理和统一递归推理框架，实现了在强非线性和显著噪声下的高效在线学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界系统通常具有多通道和高度非线性动态特性，传统建模方法难以处理。需要开发能够在线学习这些系统的有效方法。

Method: 设计异构多输出核，允许每个输出维度采用不同的核类型、超参数和输入变量；开发诱导点管理算法提高计算效率；推导统一的递归推理框架，支持扩展卡尔曼滤波、无迹卡尔曼滤波和假设密度滤波等方法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法仅用1/100的运行时间就能达到最先进离线GPSSM的精度，在强噪声下比最先进在线GPSSM精度提高约70%，同时仅使用1/20的运行时间。

Conclusion: 该方法为具有多通道和高度非线性动态的系统提供了一种高效准确的在线学习解决方案，在计算效率和准确性方面都显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate learning of system dynamics is becoming increasingly crucial for
advanced control and decision-making in engineering. However, real-world
systems often exhibit multiple channels and highly nonlinear transition
dynamics, challenging traditional modeling methods. To enable online learning
for these systems, this paper formulates the system as Gaussian process
state-space models (GPSSMs) and develops a recursive learning method. The main
contributions are threefold. First, a heterogeneous multi-output kernel is
designed, allowing each output dimension to adopt distinct kernel types,
hyperparameters, and input variables, improving expressiveness in
multi-dimensional dynamics learning. Second, an inducing-point management
algorithm enhances computational efficiency through independent selection and
pruning for each output dimension. Third, a unified recursive inference
framework for GPSSMs is derived, supporting general moment matching approaches,
including the extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and
assumed density filtering (ADF), enabling accurate learning under strong
nonlinearity and significant noise. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show that the proposed method matches the accuracy of SOTA offline
GPSSMs with only 1/100 of the runtime, and surpasses SOTA online GPSSMs by
around 70% in accuracy under heavy noise while using only 1/20 of the runtime.

*Jack Kendrick*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了tree-SNE方法，通过在t-SNE中引入尺度参数，将2维嵌入扩展为(2+1)维，解决了高维数据聚类中的尺度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非线性降维方法（如t-SNE、UMAP）在处理高维数据时面临的尺度问题——例如在MNIST数据集中，需要根据任务决定是区分不同数字还是区分同一数字的不同书写方式。

Method: 基于Robinson & Pierce-Hoffman的思想，利用t-SNE中的尺度对称性，将2维嵌入扩展为(2+1)维嵌入，其中额外参数用于控制尺度，形成了tree-SNE方法。

Result: 证明了对于除零测集外的所有初始条件，最优嵌入在尺度参数上连续依赖：tree-SNE树存在。该方法可扩展到其他吸引-排斥方法。

Conclusion: tree-SNE通过引入尺度参数有效解决了聚类中的尺度问题，为高维数据可视化和聚类提供了更灵活的方法，并具有扩展到其他相似方法的潜力。

Abstract: The clustering and visualisation of high-dimensional data is a ubiquitous
task in modern data science. Popular techniques include nonlinear
dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE or UMAP. These methods face the
`scale-problem' of clustering: when dealing with the MNIST dataset, do we want
to distinguish different digits or do we want to distinguish different ways of
writing the digits? The answer is task dependent and depends on scale. We
revisit an idea of Robinson & Pierce-Hoffman that exploits an underlying
scaling symmetry in t-SNE to replace 2-dimensional with (2+1)-dimensional
embeddings where the additional parameter accounts for scale. This gives rise
to the t-SNE tree (short: tree-SNE). We prove that the optimal embedding
depends continuously on the scaling parameter for all initial conditions
outside a set of measure 0: the tree-SNE tree exists. This idea conceivably
extends to other attraction-repulsion methods and is illustrated on several
examples.

*Fan Chen,Audrey Huang,Noah Golowich,Sadhika Malladi,Adam Block,Jordan T. Ash,Akshay Krishnamurthy,Dylan J. Foster*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文从覆盖度角度解释预训练模型下游性能，提出覆盖度比交叉熵更能预测性能，并开发了提升覆盖度的算法干预方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练成功通常用交叉熵损失衡量，但交叉熵对下游性能预测不佳。需要理解预训练如何影响最终模型成功，特别是通过覆盖度这一概念。

Method: 从理论角度分析覆盖度原则，研究覆盖度比交叉熵更快泛化的机制，开发模型选择、梯度归一化和测试时解码策略等算法干预方法。

Result: 发现覆盖度是预测下游性能的关键指标，覆盖度泛化速度快于交叉熵，避免了序列长度等参数带来的虚假依赖。

Conclusion: 覆盖度原则解释了预训练模型成功的原因，提出的算法干预方法可有效提升覆盖度，从而改善下游任务性能。

Abstract: Language models demonstrate remarkable abilities when pre-trained on large
text corpora and fine-tuned for specific tasks, but how and why pre-training
shapes the success of the final model remains poorly understood. Notably,
although pre-training success is often quantified by cross entropy loss,
cross-entropy can be a poor predictor of downstream performance. Instead, we
provide a theoretical perspective on this relationship through the lens of
\emph{coverage}, which quantifies the probability mass the pre-trained model
places on high-quality responses and which is necessary and sufficient for
post-training and test-time scaling methods such as Best-of-N to succeed. Our
main results develop an understanding of \emph{the coverage principle}, a
phenomenon whereby next-token prediction implicitly optimizes toward a model
with good coverage. In particular, we uncover a mechanism that explains the
power of coverage in predicting downstream performance: \emph{coverage
generalizes faster than cross entropy}, avoiding spurious dependence on
problem-dependent parameters such as the sequence length. We also study
practical algorithmic interventions with provable benefits for improving
coverage, including (i) model/checkpoint selection procedures, (ii) gradient
normalization schemes, and (iii) test-time decoding strategies.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文证明了核Stein差异(KSD)估计的极小极大下界为n^{-1/2}，确认了现有√n收敛率估计器的最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KSD估计器都达到√n收敛率，但缺乏理论下界证明其最优性，需要建立极小极大下界来确认这些估计器的最优性。

Method: 使用两种互补的证明策略：第一种针对ℝ^d空间上的Langevin-Stein算子和高斯核，第二种针对一般域上的KSD估计。

Result: 证明了KSD估计的极小极大下界为n^{-1/2}，其中高斯核的显式常数表明估计难度可能随维度d指数增长。

Conclusion: 确定了现有√n收敛率KSD估计器的最优性，为KSD理论提供了重要的下界支撑。

Abstract: Kernel Stein discrepancies (KSDs) have emerged as a powerful tool for
quantifying goodness-of-fit over the last decade, featuring numerous successful
applications. To the best of our knowledge, all existing KSD estimators with
known rate achieve $\sqrt n$-convergence. In this work, we present two
complementary results (with different proof strategies), establishing that the
minimax lower bound of KSD estimation is $n^{-1/2}$ and settling the optimality
of these estimators. Our first result focuses on KSD estimation on $\mathbb
R^d$ with the Langevin-Stein operator; our explicit constant for the Gaussian
kernel indicates that the difficulty of KSD estimation may increase
exponentially with the dimensionality $d$. Our second result settles the
minimax lower bound for KSD estimation on general domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Local PCA方法假设局部平坦性，CA-PCA考虑了流形曲率但仍有改进空间，需要更准确捕捉流形局部图结构的维度估计方法。

Method: 构建结合PCA和回归技术的通用框架，引入二次嵌入(QE)和总体最小二乘(TLS)两种估计器来捕捉流形的局部图结构。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，所提方法在性能上与最先进方法相当，且通常表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过整合PCA和回归技术有效捕捉流形局部结构，QE和TLS估计器在维度估计任务中具有竞争力。

Abstract: Local principal component analysis (Local PCA) has proven to be an effective
tool for estimating the intrinsic dimension of a manifold. More recently,
curvature-adjusted PCA (CA-PCA) has improved upon this approach by explicitly
accounting for the curvature of the underlying manifold, rather than assuming
local flatness. Building on these insights, we propose a general framework for
manifold dimension estimation that captures the manifold's local graph
structure by integrating PCA with regression-based techniques. Within this
framework, we introduce two representative estimators: quadratic embedding (QE)
and total least squares (TLS). Experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that these methods perform competitively with, and often
outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设无干扰，但在实际场景中干扰普遍存在，忽略干扰会导致短视策略和次优决策，增加长期后悔。

Method: FRONT方法采用一系列探索和利用策略来管理干扰复杂性，确保稳健的参数推断和后悔最小化，并建立了在线估计器的尾界和参数渐近分布。

Result: FRONT在两种不同后悔定义下均实现了次线性后悔，能够同时捕捉决策的即时和后续影响，并通过仿真和酒店利润应用验证了有效性。

Conclusion: FRONT方法成功解决了存在干扰的上下文多臂赌博机问题，通过前瞻性策略显著提升了决策质量，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Contextual bandits, which leverage the baseline features of sequentially
arriving individuals to optimize cumulative rewards while balancing exploration
and exploitation, are critical for online decision-making. Existing approaches
typically assume no interference, where each individual's action affects only
their own reward. Yet, such an assumption can be violated in many practical
scenarios, and the oversight of interference can lead to short-sighted policies
that focus solely on maximizing the immediate outcomes for individuals, which
further results in suboptimal decisions and potentially increased regret over
time. To address this significant gap, we introduce the foresighted online
policy with interference (FRONT) that innovatively considers the long-term
impact of the current decision on subsequent decisions and rewards. The
proposed FRONT method employs a sequence of exploratory and exploitative
strategies to manage the intricacies of interference, ensuring robust parameter
inference and regret minimization. Theoretically, we establish a tail bound for
the online estimator and derive the asymptotic distribution of the parameters
of interest under suitable conditions on the interference network. We further
show that FRONT attains sublinear regret under two distinct definitions,
capturing both the immediate and consequential impacts of decisions, and we
establish these results with and without statistical inference. The
effectiveness of FRONT is further demonstrated through extensive simulations
and a real-world application to urban hotel profits.

Motivation: 迁移学习和过参数化模型在现代机器学习中都很重要，但两者的交叉研究仍很缺乏。本文旨在填补这一空白，探索迁移学习与最小L2范数插值器的结合。

Method: 提出了两步迁移MNI方法：1）利用源数据训练MNI；2）在目标数据上应用迁移学习。开发了数据驱动程序来检测信息源，并引入了集成多个信息迁移MNI的方法。

Result: 理论分析揭示了非渐近超额风险特征，识别了迁移MNI优于目标专用MNI的条件。发现了免费午餐协变量偏移机制，即利用异构数据能以有限成本获得知识转移收益。有限样本实验验证了方法对模型和数据异质性的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 迁移MNI方法在特定条件下能显著优于传统方法，通过检测信息源和集成策略，可以有效利用异构数据提升性能，为迁移学习与过参数化模型的结合提供了理论支撑和实践指导。

Abstract: Transfer learning is a key component of modern machine learning, enhancing
the performance of target tasks by leveraging diverse data sources.
Simultaneously, overparameterized models such as the minimum-$\ell_2$-norm
interpolator (MNI) in high-dimensional linear regression have garnered
significant attention for their remarkable generalization capabilities, a
property known as benign overfitting. Despite their individual importance, the
intersection of transfer learning and MNI remains largely unexplored. Our
research bridges this gap by proposing a novel two-step Transfer MNI approach
and analyzing its trade-offs. We characterize its non-asymptotic excess risk
and identify conditions under which it outperforms the target-only MNI. Our
analysis reveals free-lunch covariate shift regimes, where leveraging
heterogeneous data yields the benefit of knowledge transfer at limited cost. To
operationalize our findings, we develop a data-driven procedure to detect
informative sources and introduce an ensemble method incorporating multiple
informative Transfer MNIs. Finite-sample experiments demonstrate the robustness
of our methods to model and data heterogeneity, confirming their advantage.

### [109] [RankSEG-RMA: An Efficient Segmentation Algorithm via Reciprocal Moment Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15362)
*Zixun Wang,Ben Dai*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出RankSEG-RMA方法，通过互易矩近似降低RankSEG的计算复杂度，从O(d log d)和O(d²)降至O(d)，同时保持性能，并扩展到非重叠分割场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语义分割方法通常使用argmax或阈值处理来获得最终预测，但这些方法不能直接优化分割指标，导致结果不一致或次优。RankSEG虽然能改善性能，但存在计算复杂度高和仅适用于重叠分割的问题。

Method: 提出RankSEG-RMA方法，使用互易矩近似来降低RankSEG的计算复杂度，同时开发了像素级评分函数，支持非重叠分割场景的高效实现。

Result: RankSEG-RMA将RankDice和RankIoU的复杂度从O(d log d)和O(d²)降低到O(d)，在LiTS数据集上预测时间从16.33秒减少到接近argmax规则的0.01秒，同时保持可比的性能。

Conclusion: RankSEG-RMA成功解决了RankSEG的计算复杂度和应用范围限制，为语义分割提供了一种高效且通用的优化方法。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation labels each pixel in an image with its corresponding
class, and is typically evaluated using the Intersection over Union (IoU) and
Dice metrics to quantify the overlap between predicted and ground-truth
segmentation masks. In the literature, most existing methods estimate
pixel-wise class probabilities, then apply argmax or thresholding to obtain the
final prediction. These methods have been shown to generally lead to
inconsistent or suboptimal results, as they do not directly maximize
segmentation metrics. To address this issue, a novel consistent segmentation
framework, RankSEG, has been proposed, which includes RankDice and RankIoU
specifically designed to optimize the Dice and IoU metrics, respectively.
Although RankSEG almost guarantees improved performance, it suffers from two
major drawbacks. First, it is its computational expense-RankDice has a
complexity of O(d log d) with a substantial constant factor (where d represents
the number of pixels), while RankIoU exhibits even higher complexity O(d^2),
thus limiting its practical application. For instance, in LiTS, prediction with
RankSEG takes 16.33 seconds compared to just 0.01 seconds with the argmax rule.
Second, RankSEG is only applicable to overlapping segmentation settings, where
multiple classes can occupy the same pixel, which contrasts with standard
benchmarks that typically assume non-overlapping segmentation. In this paper,
we overcome these two drawbacks via a reciprocal moment approximation (RMA) of
RankSEG with the following contributions: (i) we improve RankSEG using RMA,
namely RankSEG-RMA, reduces the complexity of both algorithms to O(d) while
maintaining comparable performance; (ii) inspired by RMA, we develop a
pixel-wise score function that allows efficient implementation for
non-overlapping segmentation settings.

Result: 获得了明确依赖于核谱、因果结构参数和采样机制（包括信号和噪声的相对样本大小）的过量风险界限。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了核岭回归理论，同时为分析现代机器学习应用中的依赖数据提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a foundational tool in machine learning,
with recent work emphasizing its connections to neural networks. However,
existing theory primarily addresses the i.i.d. setting, while real-world data
often exhibits structured dependencies - particularly in applications like
denoising score learning where multiple noisy observations derive from shared
underlying signals. We present the first systematic study of KRR generalization
for non-i.i.d. data with signal-noise causal structure, where observations
represent different noisy views of common signals. By developing a novel
blockwise decomposition method that enables precise concentration analysis for
dependent data, we derive excess risk bounds for KRR that explicitly depend on:
(1) the kernel spectrum, (2) causal structure parameters, and (3) sampling
mechanisms (including relative sample sizes for signals and noises). We further
apply our results to denoising score learning, establishing generalization
guarantees and providing principled guidance for sampling noisy data points.
This work advances KRR theory while providing practical tools for analyzing
dependent data in modern machine learning applications.

Abstract: Open world Machine Learning (OWML) aims to develop intelligent systems
capable of recognizing known categories, rejecting unknown samples, and
continually learning from novel information. Despite significant progress in
open set recognition, novelty detection, and continual learning, the field
still lacks a unified theoretical foundation that can quantify uncertainty,
characterize information transfer, and explain learning adaptability in
dynamic, nonstationary environments. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of information theoretic approaches in open world machine learning, emphasizing
how core concepts such as entropy, mutual information, and Kullback Leibler
divergence provide a mathematical language for describing knowledge
acquisition, uncertainty suppression, and risk control under open world
conditions. We synthesize recent studies into three major research axes:
information theoretic open set recognition enabling safe rejection of unknowns,
information driven novelty discovery guiding new concept formation, and
information retentive continual learning ensuring stable long term adaptation.
Furthermore, we discuss theoretical connections between information theory and
provable learning frameworks, including PAC Bayes bounds, open-space risk
theory, and causal information flow, to establish a pathway toward provable and
trustworthy open world intelligence. Finally, the review identifies key open
problems and future research directions, such as the quantification of
information risk, development of dynamic mutual information bounds, multimodal
information fusion, and integration of information theory with causal reasoning
and world model learning.

### [112] [Robust Optimization in Causal Models and G-Causal Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15458)
*Gabriele Visentin,Patrick Cheridito*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文证明因果模型中的干预鲁棒优化问题在G-因果Wasserstein距离下是连续的，但在标准Wasserstein距离下可能不连续，因此提出了一种满足因果结构模型通用逼近性质的新型归一化流架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型在数据增强时可能不尊重因果结构，导致在干预鲁棒优化任务中表现不佳，因此需要开发能够最小化G-因果Wasserstein距离的因果感知生成模型。

Method: 提出一种新的归一化流架构，该架构满足因果结构模型的通用逼近性质，并能有效训练以最小化G-因果Wasserstein距离。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在因果回归和因果因子模型中的均值-方差投资组合优化的数据增强任务中，优于标准的非因果生成模型。

Conclusion: 使用尊重因果结构的生成模型对于干预鲁棒优化任务的数据增强至关重要，提出的因果归一化流架构在此类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that interventionally robust optimization problems in
causal models are continuous under the $G$-causal Wasserstein distance, but may
be discontinuous under the standard Wasserstein distance. This highlights the
importance of using generative models that respect the causal structure when
augmenting data for such tasks. To this end, we propose a new normalizing flow
architecture that satisfies a universal approximation property for causal
structural models and can be efficiently trained to minimize the $G$-causal
Wasserstein distance. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model outperforms
standard (non-causal) generative models in data augmentation for causal
regression and mean-variance portfolio optimization in causal factor models.

*Samuel Girard,Aurélien Bibaut,Houssam Zenati*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对自适应实验的方差正则化悲观离策略学习方法，通过自归一化极大不等式处理依赖数据，在参数和非参数情况下都获得了比标准1/√n更快的收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自适应实验产生依赖数据，打破了传统浓度不等式和标准学习保证所依赖的i.i.d.假设，需要开发适用于一般依赖数据的理论框架。

Method: 开发了鞅经验过程的自归一化极大不等式，提出自适应样本方差惩罚程序，并构建方差正则化悲观离策略学习目标，结合顺序更新策略。

Result: 在标准复杂度和边界条件下，所得估计器在参数和非参数情况下都实现了快速收敛速率，优于通常的1/√n基准。数值模拟验证了方法的实际优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为自适应实验中的依赖数据提供了有效的学习保证，通过方差正则化实现了更快的收敛性能。

Abstract: Adaptive experiments produce dependent data that break i.i.d. assumptions
that underlie classical concentration bounds and invalidate standard learning
guarantees. In this paper, we develop a self-normalized maximal inequality for
martingale empirical processes. Building on this, we first propose an adaptive
sample-variance penalization procedure which balances empirical loss and sample
variance, valid for general dependent data. Next, this allows us to derive a
new variance-regularized pessimistic off-policy learning objective, for which
we establish excess-risk guarantees. Subsequently, we show that, when combined
with sequential updates and under standard complexity and margin conditions,
the resulting estimator achieves fast convergence rates in both parametric and
nonparametric regimes, improving over the usual $1/\sqrt{n}$
  baseline. We complement our theoretical findings with numerical simulations
that illustrate the practical gains of our approach.

### [114] [Geometric Convergence Analysis of Variational Inference via Bregman Divergences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15548)
*Sushil Bohara,Amedeo Roberto Esposito*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于指数族分布的变分推断收敛性分析理论框架，通过将负ELBO表示为关于对数配分函数的Bregman散度，证明了梯度下降算法在常数和递减步长下的非渐近收敛率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分推断虽然提供了可扩展的贝叶斯推断框架，但由于ELBO目标在欧几里得空间中的非凸性和非光滑性，其收敛性分析一直具有挑战性。

Method: 利用指数族分布结构，将负ELBO表示为Bregman散度，通过参数空间中射线上的目标函数边界分析，建立基于Fisher信息矩阵谱特性的几何分析框架。

Result: 证明了Bregman表示具有弱单调性，虽然弱于凸性但足以支持严格的收敛性分析，并建立了梯度下降算法的非渐近收敛率。

Conclusion: 该几何框架为变分推断收敛性分析提供了理论基础，证明了在适当条件下梯度下降算法能够收敛。

Abstract: Variational Inference (VI) provides a scalable framework for Bayesian
inference by optimizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), but convergence
analysis remains challenging due to the objective's non-convexity and
non-smoothness in Euclidean space. We establish a novel theoretical framework
for analyzing VI convergence by exploiting the exponential family structure of
distributions. We express negative ELBO as a Bregman divergence with respect to
the log-partition function, enabling a geometric analysis of the optimization
landscape. We show that this Bregman representation admits a weak monotonicity
property that, while weaker than convexity, provides sufficient structure for
rigorous convergence analysis. By deriving bounds on the objective function
along rays in parameter space, we establish properties governed by the spectral
characteristics of the Fisher information matrix. Under this geometric
framework, we prove non-asymptotic convergence rates for gradient descent
algorithms with both constant and diminishing step sizes.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出基于核的工具集来评估条件序列模型设计并调整超参数，重点是计算生物学问题。核心是新的条件分布差异度量ACMMD，可用于量化模型拟合度、假设检验和评估模型可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要开发工具来评估条件序列模型的设计质量和调整超参数，特别是在计算生物学领域，以解决模型拟合度评估和可靠性分析的问题。

Method: 使用新的Augmented Conditional Maximum Mean Discrepancy (ACMMD)度量方法，该度量可以无偏估计真实条件分布与模型估计之间的差异，并集成到假设检验中。

Result: 通过分析ProteinMPNN蛋白质设计模型，能够拒绝该模型对多种蛋白质家族数据拟合的假设，并通过调整温度超参数实现更好的拟合。

Conclusion: 提出的ACMMD方法为条件序列模型提供了有效的评估工具，能够量化模型拟合度并进行超参数优化，在计算生物学应用中表现出实用价值。

Abstract: We propose a set of kernel-based tools to evaluate the designs and tune the
hyperparameters of conditional sequence models, with a focus on problems in
computational biology. The backbone of our tools is a new measure of
discrepancy between the true conditional distribution and the model's estimate,
called the Augmented Conditional Maximum Mean Discrepancy (ACMMD). Provided
that the model can be sampled from, the ACMMD can be estimated unbiasedly from
data to quantify absolute model fit, integrated within hypothesis tests, and
used to evaluate model reliability. We demonstrate the utility of our approach
by analyzing a popular protein design model, ProteinMPNN. We are able to reject
the hypothesis that ProteinMPNN fits its data for various protein families, and
tune the model's temperature hyperparameter to achieve a better fit.

Motivation: 传统VAE使用单一连续潜在空间学习解耦表示，本文探索使用离散潜在变量结合多个VAE表示的方法，特别适用于声学数据等源组合场景。

Method: 构建多流VAE框架，基于源组合的显式模型（线性组合模型），推导推理和学习方程，在叠加手写数字和混合声源任务中验证方法。

Result: 在数字分离任务中观察到清晰分离效果，在说话人日志任务中表现出特别低的说话人漏检率，实验显示方法在不同监督程度和训练数据量下具有灵活性。

Conclusion: MS-VAE方法具有领域无关性，能够有效分离不同源到不同流中，在源分离任务中表现优异，特别在说话人漏检方面效果显著。

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a leading approach to address the problem
of learning disentangled representations. Typically a single VAE is used and
disentangled representations are sought in its continuous latent space. Here we
explore a different approach by using discrete latents to combine
VAE-representations of individual sources. The combination is done based on an
explicit model for source combination, and we here use a linear combination
model which is well suited, e.g., for acoustic data. We formally define such a
multi-stream VAE (MS-VAE) approach, derive its inference and learning
equations, and we numerically investigate its principled functionality. The
MS-VAE is domain-agnostic, and we here explore its ability to separate sources
into different streams using superimposed hand-written digits, and mixed
acoustic sources in a speaker diarization task. We observe a clear separation
of digits, and on speaker diarization we observe an especially low rate of
missed speakers. Numerical experiments further highlight the flexibility of the
approach across varying amounts of supervision and training data.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文建立了更通用的等变神经网络普适性理论，证明了在分离约束下，通过添加全连接读出层或增加网络深度，等变神经网络能够实现普适性逼近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有等变神经网络的普适性结果大多局限于特定设置：要么依赖高维张量表示导致隐藏空间维度过高，要么局限于专门的架构。需要发展更通用的理论框架。

Method: 对于不变网络，在分离约束下建立普适性定理；对于等变网络，引入新的"逐项可分性"标准，并证明通过增加深度或添加适当读出层可实现普适性。

Result: 证明了在分离约束条件下，不变网络通过添加全连接读出层可实现连续函数的逼近；等变网络在逐项可分性机制下，通过足够深度或适当读出层也能实现普适性。

Conclusion: 深度和读出层是实现等变神经网络普适性的关键机制，该研究提供了一个统一视角，涵盖并扩展了早期的专门结果。

Abstract: Universality results for equivariant neural networks remain rare. Those that
do exist typically hold only in restrictive settings: either they rely on
regular or higher-order tensor representations, leading to impractically
high-dimensional hidden spaces, or they target specialized architectures, often
confined to the invariant setting. This work develops a more general account.
For invariant networks, we establish a universality theorem under separation
constraints, showing that the addition of a fully connected readout layer
secures approximation within the class of separation-constrained continuous
functions. For equivariant networks, where results are even scarcer, we
demonstrate that standard separability notions are inadequate and introduce the
sharper criterion of $\textit{entry-wise separability}$. We show that with
sufficient depth or with the addition of appropriate readout layers,
equivariant networks attain universality within the entry-wise separable
regime. Together with prior results showing the failure of universality for
shallow models, our findings identify depth and readout layers as a decisive
mechanism for universality, additionally offering a unified perspective that
subsumes and extends earlier specialized results.

Result: 建立了组合评分均方误差的上界，该上界明确考虑了观测数量对误差累积的影响，为理解扩散方法在多重观测下的性能提供了理论保证。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了组合评分方法中误差累积的理论特性，为基于扩散的模拟推理在多观测场景下的应用提供了重要的理论支撑和分析工具。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) has become a widely used framework in
applied sciences for estimating the parameters of stochastic models that best
explain experimental observations. A central question in this setting is how to
effectively combine multiple observations in order to improve parameter
inference and obtain sharper posterior distributions. Recent advances in
score-based diffusion methods address this problem by constructing a
compositional score, obtained by aggregating individual posterior scores within
the diffusion process. While it is natural to suspect that the accumulation of
individual errors may significantly degrade sampling quality as the number of
observations grows, this important theoretical issue has so far remained
unexplored. In this paper, we study the compositional score produced by the
GAUSS algorithm of Linhart et al. (2024) and establish an upper bound on its
mean squared error in terms of both the individual score errors and the number
of observations. We illustrate our theoretical findings on a Gaussian example,
where all analytical expressions can be derived in a closed form.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非交换环境下的共形推理问题，通过Blackwell的可接近性理论来分析和改进自适应共形推理方法。

Method: 将自适应共形推理重新表述为重复的二人向量值有限博弈，设计基于校准的可接近性策略来同时实现覆盖率和效率目标。

Result: 提出的算法具有强大的理论保证，并提供了实用的见解，但其计算负担可能限制实际部署。

Conclusion: 基于Blackwell可接近性理论的方法为处理非交换环境下的共形推理提供了新的理论框架和实用算法，尽管计算复杂度是需要考虑的问题。

Abstract: We study conformal inference in non-exchangeable environments through the
lens of Blackwell's theory of approachability. We first recast adaptive
conformal inference (ACI, Gibbs and Cand\`es, 2021) as a repeated two-player
vector-valued finite game and characterize attainable coverage--efficiency
tradeoffs. We then construct coverage and efficiency objectives under potential
restrictions on the adversary's play, and design a calibration-based
approachability strategy to achieve these goals. The resulting algorithm enjoys
strong theoretical guarantees and provides practical insights, though its
computational burden may limit deployment in practice.
