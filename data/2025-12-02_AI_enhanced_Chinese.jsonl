For the offline-learning phase, we establish an upper bound on the generalization error for approximate nonlinear-least-squares estimation under general datasets with strong correlation and distribution shift, leveraging the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the distributional discrepancies. For the online-adaptation phase, we address, on the basis of the offline-trained model, the possible uncertain parameter drift in real-world target systems by proposing a meta-LMS prediction algorithm.

These processes often operate in a dynamic environment, which faces disturbances such as processing delays and demand changes. To minimise long-term cost and system nervousness (i.e., disruptive changes to schedules), schedulers must design rescheduling strategies to address such disturbances effectively. Existing methods often assume complete look-ahead information over the scheduling horizon. This assumption contrasts with realistic situations where schedulers can only access incomplete look-ahead information. Sticking with existing methods may lead to suboptimal long-term costs and high-level system nervousness. In this work we propose a Bayesian dynamic scheduling method. Our method relies on learning a Bayesian Network from the probability distribution of disturbances. Specifically, the Bayesian Network represents how likely each operation will be impacted by disturbances. During the online execution, when new disturbances become observed, this method updates the posterior distribution and therefore guides the rescheduling strategy. We compare our method with the existing periodic rescheduling strategy (which generates new schedules from scratch at fixed intervals) on four benchmark problems. Computational results show that our method achieves statistically better long-term costs and system nervousness. In the theoretical aspect, we prove that if disturbances are mutually independent, the impact-quantifying variables inherently satisfy the independence assumptions required by Bayesian Networks. As an implication, practitioners can extend the method to other scheduling problems (such as job shop scheduling and continuous processes), given that they define the problem-specific dependencies between operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u6270\u52a8\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u6307\u5bfc\u91cd\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5468\u671f\u6027\u91cd\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u957f\u671f\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u7528\u9014\u6279\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5904\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5b8c\u5168\u524d\u77bb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u53ea\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u671f\u6210\u672c\u6b21\u4f18\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4ece\u6270\u52a8\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8868\u793a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u53d7\u6270\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u6267\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f53\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u65b0\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u91cd\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5468\u671f\u6027\u91cd\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u671f\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u5982\u679c\u6270\u52a8\u76f8\u4e92\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\u81ea\u7136\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u5b9a\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

A model-free Q-learning algorithm was implemented to dynamically adjust the brightness of a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) based on real-time feedback from a light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensor. The system was trained to stabilize at 13 distinct light intensity levels (L1 to L13), with each target corresponding to a specific range within the 64-state space derived from LDR readings. A total of 130 trials were conducted, covering all target levels with 10 episodes each. Performance was evaluated in terms of convergence speed, steps taken, and time required to reach target states. Box plots and histograms were generated to analyze the distribution of training time and learning efficiency across targets. Experimental validation demonstrated that the agent could effectively learn to stabilize at varying light levels with minimal overshooting and smooth convergence, even in the presence of environmental perturbations.

More specifically, a novel connection between the total prediction error and SG-projection spaces is developed to reduce the implementation complexity of cross-validation method.

Classical DA methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter, rely on Gaussian approximations and heuristic tuning (e.g., inflation and localization) to scale to high dimensions. While often successful, these approximations can make the methods unstable or inaccurate when the underlying distributions of states and observations depart significantly from Gaussianity. To address this limitation, we introduce DAISI, a scalable filtering algorithm built on flow-based generative models that enables flexible probabilistic inference using data-driven priors. The core idea is to use a stationary, pre-trained generative prior to assimilate observations via guidance-based conditional sampling while incorporating forecast information through a novel inverse-sampling step. This step maps the forecast ensemble into a latent space to provide initial conditions for the conditional sampling, allowing us to encode model dynamics into the DA pipeline without having to retrain or fine-tune the generative prior at each assimilation step. Experiments on challenging nonlinear systems show that DAISI achieves accurate filtering results in regimes with sparse, noisy, and nonlinear observations where traditional methods struggle.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAISI\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u91c7\u6837\u5904\u7406\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c2\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u96c6\u5408\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8c03\u53c2\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6216\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "DAISI\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u91c7\u6837\u540c\u5316\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9006\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u5c06\u9884\u62a5\u96c6\u5408\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u540c\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cDAISI\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73", "conclusion": "DAISI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u540c\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84"}}

While these models provide rigorous quantitative insights, their outputs are often highly technical, making them difficult to interpret for non-expert stakeholders such as policymakers, planners, and the public. This communication gap limits the accessibility and practical impact of scenario-based modeling, particularly as energy transitions grow more complex with rising shares of renewables, sectoral integration, and deep uncertainties. To address this challenge, we propose the Renewable Energy Large Language Model (RE-LLM), a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the energy system modeling workflow. RE-LLM combines three core elements: (i) optimization-based scenario exploration, (ii) machine learning surrogates that accelerate computationally intensive simulations, and (iii) LLM-powered natural language generation that translates complex results into clear, stakeholder-oriented explanations. This integrated design not only reduces computational burden but also enhances inter-pretability, enabling real-time reasoning about trade-offs, sensitivities, and policy implications. The framework is adaptable across different optimization platforms and energy system models, ensuring broad applicability beyond the case study presented. By merging speed, rigor, and interpretability, RE-LLM advances a new paradigm of human-centric energy modeling. It enables interactive, multilingual, and accessible engagement with future energy pathways, ultimately bridging the final gap between data-driven analysis and actionable decision-making for sustainable transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRE-LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u5230\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u679c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6613\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u90e8\u95e8\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u679c\u6280\u672f\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u3002\u968f\u7740\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6c9f\u901a\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRE-LLM\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u7d20\uff1a1)\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u63a2\u7d22\uff1b2)\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6a21\u62df\uff1b3)LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u679c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6e05\u6670\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6743\u8861\u5206\u6790\u3001\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RE-LLM\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u5efa\u6a21\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u672a\u6765\u80fd\u6e90\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8f6c\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002"}}

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a key enabling technology, offering dynamic control over the radio propagation environment to overcome these challenges. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of RIS-aided localization and sensing, bridging fundamental theory with practical implementation. The core principles of the RIS technology are first described detailing how programmable metasurfaces can intelligently combat blockages, enhance signal diversity, and create virtual line-of-sight (LoS) links. The chapter then reviews a range of application scenarios where RISs can offer significant improvements. A significant portion of the chapter is dedicated to algorithmic methodologies, covering beam sweeping protocols, codebook-based techniques, and advanced optimization and machine learning strategies for both localization and sensing.

Both belong to the class of tree-based ensemble methods, where predictions are obtained by aggregating many randomized regression trees. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing such methods through Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs) constructed on tree ensembles -- more precisely, on the random partitions generated by randomized regression trees. We establish fundamental analytical properties of the resulting Random Forest kernel, including boundedness, continuity, and universality, and show that a Random Forest predictor can be characterized as the unique minimizer of a penalized empirical risk functional in this RKHS, providing a variational interpretation of ensemble learning. We further extend this perspective to the continuous-time formulation of Gradient Boosting introduced by Dombry and Duchamps, and demonstrate that it corresponds to a gradient flow on a Hilbert manifold induced by the Random Forest RKHS. A key feature of this framework is that both the kernel and the RKHS geometry are data-dependent, offering a theoretical explanation for the strong empirical performance of tree-based ensembles. Finally, we illustrate the practical potential of this approach by introducing a kernel principal component analysis built on the Random Forest kernel, which enhances the interpretability of ensemble models, as well as GVI, a new geometric variable importance criterion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7b49\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6838\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u662f\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u968f\u673a\u56de\u5f52\u6811\u751f\u6210\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5212\u5206\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6838\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u6709\u754c\u6027\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u662f\u8be5RKHS\u4e2d\u60e9\u7f5a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u98ce\u9669\u6cdb\u51fd\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u516c\u5f0f\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u8be5RKHS\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6838\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5206\u6790\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6838\u7684\u6838\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u51c6\u5219GVI\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6838\u548cRKHS\u51e0\u4f55\u4e3a\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982\u6838PCA\u548cGVI\uff09\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In practical multiuser deployments, two considerations arise: the common stream decoding constraint imposed by the weakest user, and residual inter-user interference can remain non-negligible, particularly in single-input single-output (SISO) broadcast settings and under an imperfect CSIT scenario. Motivated by prior advances of RSMA research, we investigate a complementary mechanism-fluid antenna systems (FAS), with dynamic port reconfiguration supplies adaptive spatial selectivity without altering the RSMA signaling structure. Can FAS help alleviate these considerations and enhance RSMA performance? We develop a tractable correlation-aware analytical framework based on block-correlation models, including constant block correlation (CBC) and variable block correlation (VBC), to capture realistic spatial dependence among ports. Closed-form expressions are derived for outage probability (OP) and average capacity (AC), revealing how port reconfiguration strengthens the weakest effective channel and improves SINR through higher channel gains and lower relative noise impact. Monte Carlo simulations verify the analysis and show that VBC matches simulations more tightly than CBC across all port configurations.

However, for time-varying objectives, it is known that no-regret is unattainable under pure bandit feedback unless strong and often unrealistic assumptions are imposed.\n  In this article, we propose a novel method to optimize time-varying rewards in the frequentist setting, where the objective has bounded RKHS norm. Time variations are captured through uncertainty injection (UI), which enables heteroscedastic GP regression that adapts past observations to the current time step. As no-regret is unattainable in general in the strict bandit setting, we relax the latter allowing additional queries on previously observed points. Building on sparse inference and the effect of UI on regret, we propose \\textbf{W-SparQ-GP-UCB}, an online algorithm that achieves no-regret with only a vanishing number of additional queries per iteration. To assess the theoretical limits of this approach, we establish a lower bound on the number of additional queries required for no-regret, proving the efficiency of our method. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis linking the degree of time-variation of the function to achievable regret rates, together with upper and lower bounds on the number of additional queries needed in each regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faW-SparQ-GP-UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u53d8\u9ed1\u76d2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u5141\u8bb8\u5c11\u91cf\u989d\u5916\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9057\u61be\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfGP-UCB\u7b49\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65e0\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65f6\u53d8\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u7eafbandit\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u65bd\u52a0\u5f3a\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u53d8\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faW-SparQ-GP-UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u5165(UI)\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u65b9\u5deeGP\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5c06\u8fc7\u53bb\u89c2\u6d4b\u9002\u5e94\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\uff1b2) \u653e\u5bbd\u4e25\u683cbandit\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5bf9\u5148\u524d\u89c2\u5bdf\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u989d\u5916\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b3) \u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u63a8\u7406\u548cUI\u5bf9\u9057\u61be\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u6bcf\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ec5\u9700\u6d88\u5931\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u989d\u5916\u67e5\u8be2\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9057\u61be\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51fd\u6570\u65f6\u53d8\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u9057\u61be\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5404\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u6240\u9700\u989d\u5916\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u63a8\u7406\uff0cW-SparQ-GP-UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5141\u8bb8\u5c11\u91cf\u989d\u5916\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u653e\u5bbdbandit\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u53d8\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9057\u61be\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u53d8\u9ed1\u76d2\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Existing methods aim to overcome this so-called curse of dimensionality by carefully encoding structural assumptions, from locality to sparsity to smoothness, into the optimization procedure. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that these approaches are outperformed by arguably the simplest method imaginable: Bayesian linear regression. After applying a geometric transformation to avoid boundary-seeking behavior, Gaussian processes with linear kernels match state-of-the-art performance on tasks with 60- to 6,000-dimensional search spaces. Linear models offer numerous advantages over their non-parametric counterparts: they afford closed-form sampling and their computation scales linearly with data, a fact we exploit on molecular optimization tasks with > 20,000 observations.

We first generalize a previously established informational threshold from Vassaux and Massouli\u00e9 (2025) to regimes where the number of observed graphs $p$ may also grow with the number of nodes $n$: when $p \\leq O(n/\\log(n))$, we recover the results from Vassaux and Massouli\u00e9 (2025), and $p \\geq \u03a9(n/\\log(n))$ corresponds to a regime where the problem is as difficult as aligning one single graph with some unknown \"signal\" graph. Moreover, when $\\log p = \u03c9(\\log n)$, the informational thresholds for partial and exact recovery no longer coincide, in contrast to the all-or-nothing phenomenon observed when $\\log p=O(\\log n)$. Then, we provide the first computational barrier in the low-degree framework for (multiple) Gaussian graph alignment. We prove that when the correlation $\u03c1$ is less than $1$, up to logarithmic terms, low degree non-trivial estimation fails. Our results suggest that the task of aligning $p$ graphs in polynomial time is as hard as the problem of aligning two graphs in polynomial time, up to logarithmic factors. These results characterize the existence of a statistical-computational gap and provide another example in which polynomial-time algorithms cannot handle complex combinatorial bi-dimensional structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u9ad8\u65af\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1-\u8ba1\u7b97\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u9608\u503c\u5230p\u968fn\u589e\u957f\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u4f4e\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u03c1<1\u65f6\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u9ad8\u65af\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1-\u8ba1\u7b97\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u5373\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u89e3\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5f53\u89c2\u6d4b\u56fe\u6570\u91cfp\u968f\u8282\u70b9\u6570n\u589e\u957f\u65f6\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06Vassaux\u548cMassouli\u00e9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u9608\u503c\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230p\u968fn\u589e\u957f\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff1b2. \u5728\u4f4e\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u591a\u9ad8\u65af\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u5efa\u7acb\u8ba1\u7b97\u969c\u788d\uff1b3. \u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540cp\u589e\u957f\u901f\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u6062\u590d\u9608\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "1. \u5f53p\u2264O(n/log n)\u65f6\u6062\u590dVassaux\u548cMassouli\u00e9\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b2. \u5f53p\u2265\u03a9(n/log n)\u65f6\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5355\u4e2a\u56fe\u4e0e\u672a\u77e5\u4fe1\u53f7\u56fe\uff1b3. \u5f53log p=\u03c9(log n)\u65f6\u90e8\u5206\u6062\u590d\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u6062\u590d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u9608\u503c\u4e0d\u518d\u91cd\u5408\uff1b4. \u5f53\u03c1<1\u65f6\u4f4e\u5ea6\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u4f30\u8ba1\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9f50p\u4e2a\u56fe\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e24\u4e2a\u56fe\u96be\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u9ad8\u65af\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b58\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1-\u8ba1\u7b97\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c8\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f8b\u8bc1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u89e3\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002"}}

Mixed numeric and categorical fields, weak feature structure, and limited labeled data make scaling and generalization challenging. To this end, we introduce Orion-Bix, a tabular foundation model that combines biaxial attention with meta-learned in-context reasoning for few-shot tabular learning. Its encoder alternates standard, grouped, hierarchical, and relational attention, fusing their outputs through multi-CLS summarization to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. A label-aware ICL head adapts on the fly and scales to large label spaces via hierarchical decision routing. Meta-trained on synthetically generated, structurally diverse tables with causal priors, Orion-Bix learns transferable inductive biases across heterogeneous data. Delivered as a scikit-learn compatible foundation model, it outperforms gradient-boosting baselines and remains competitive with state-of-the-art tabular foundation models on public benchmarks, showing that biaxial attention with episodic meta-training enables robust, few-shot-ready tabular learning.

Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning, we propose to learn self-sufficient signals: A recovered signal should be able to reconstruct a missing value of its own from all remaining components without relying on any other signals. We formulate this problem as the minimization of a conditional KL divergence. Compared to traditional maximum likelihood estimation, our algorithm is prior-free and likelihood-free, meaning that we do not need to impose any prior on the original signals or any observational model, which often restricts the model's flexibility. To tackle the KL divergence minimization problem, we propose a sequential algorithm that reduces the KL divergence and learns an optimal de-mixing flow model at each iteration. This approach completely avoids the unstable adversarial training, a common issue in minimizing the KL divergence.

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly U-Net-based architectures, have significantly improved automated horizon tracking. However, challenges remain in accurately segmenting complex geological features and interpolating horizons from sparse annotations. To address these issues, a hybrid framework is presented that integrates advanced U-Net variants with spatial clustering to enhance horizon continuity and geometric fidelity. The core contribution is the Context Fusion Attention (CFA) U-Net, a novel architecture that fuses spatial and Sobel-derived geometric features within attention gates to improve both precision and surface completeness. The performance of five architectures, the U-Net (Standard and compressed), U-Net++, Attention U-Net, and CFA U-Net, was systematically evaluated across various data sparsity regimes (10-, 20-, and 40-line spacing). This approach outperformed existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Mexilhao field (Santos Basin, Brazil) dataset with a validation IoU of 0.881 and MAE of 2.49ms, and excellent surface coverage of 97.6% on the F3 Block of the North Sea dataset under sparse conditions. The framework further refines merged horizon predictions (inline and cross-line) using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to produce geologically plausible surfaces. The results demonstrate the advantages of hybrid methodologies and attention-based architectures enhanced with geometric context, providing a robust and generalizable solution for seismic interpretation in structurally complex and data-scarce environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCFA U-Net\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u5730\u9707\u5c42\u4f4d\u89e3\u91ca\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709U-Net\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u8d28\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5272\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u6ce8\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u5c42\u4f4d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) CFA U-Net\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u548cSobel\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u95e8\uff1b2) \u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528DBSCAN\u805a\u7c7b\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u4f4d\u9884\u6d4b", "result": "\u5728\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u5229\u4e9a\u6cb9\u7530\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230IoU 0.881\u548cMAE 2.49ms\uff0c\u5728\u5317\u6d77F3\u533a\u5757\u7a00\u758f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b097.6%\u8868\u9762\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5730\u9707\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

When the emitter is deviated greatly from the normal direction of antenna element or is close to the null-point direction, the sensing energy by array will be seriously attenuated such that the direction-sensing performance is degraded significantly. To address such an issue, a rotatable array system is established with the directive antenna pattern of each element taken into account, where each element has the same antenna pattern. Then, the corresponding the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived. Finally, a recursive rotation Root-MUSIC (RR-Root-MUSIC) direction-sensing method is proposed and its mean-square-error (MSE) performance is evaluated by the derived CRLB. Simulation results show that the proposed rotation method converges rapidly with about ten iterations, and make a significant enhancement on the direction-sensing accuracy in terms of MSE when the target direction departs seriously far away from the normal vector of array.

Our analysis yields three main results. First, we provide an exact validity construction that applies to any fixed restricted permutation set. Second, for both the difference of sample means and the unbiased $\\widehat{\\mathrm{MMD}}^{2}$ estimator, we derive closed-form one-swap increment identities whose conditional variances scale as $O(h^{2})$, in contrast to the $\u0398(h)$ increment variability under full relabeling. This increment-level variance contraction sharpens the Bernstein--Freedman variance proxy and leads to substantially smaller permutation critical values. Third, we obtain explicit, data-dependent expressions for the resulting critical values and statistical power. Together, these results show that block-restricted one-swap permutations can achieve strictly higher power than classical full permutation tests while maintaining exact finite-sample validity, without relying on pessimistic worst-case Lipschitz bounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5757\u9650\u5236\u5355\u4ea4\u6362\u7f6e\u6362\u7684\u4e24\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u7f6e\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7f6e\u6362\u68c0\u9a8c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u968f\u673a\u91cd\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u7f6e\u6362\u4e34\u754c\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f6e\u6362\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u7f6e\u6362\u8303\u56f4\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u9a8c\u529f\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5757\u9650\u5236\u5355\u4ea4\u6362\u7f6e\u6362\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u5c06\u6837\u672c\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5757\u5185\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u8868\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u53ea\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u5757\u4ee3\u8868\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u6b21\u4ea4\u53c9\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u548c\u65e0\u504fMMD\u00b2\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u5355\u4ea4\u6362\u589e\u91cf\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "1) \u4e3a\u4efb\u4f55\u56fa\u5b9a\u9650\u5236\u7f6e\u6362\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6784\u9020\uff1b2) \u6761\u4ef6\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u653e\u4e3aO(h\u00b2)\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5168\u7f6e\u6362\u7684\u0398(h)\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff1b3) \u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e34\u754c\u503c\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b4) \u5757\u9650\u5236\u5355\u4ea4\u6362\u7f6e\u6362\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u5168\u7f6e\u6362\u68c0\u9a8c\u5177\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u529f\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5757\u9650\u5236\u5355\u4ea4\u6362\u7f6e\u6362\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u7f6e\u6362\u68c0\u9a8c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u60b2\u89c2\u7684Lipschitz\u754c\u3002"}}

By analysing the Riemannian pullback metric across layers of a neural network, we find that network computation can be decomposed into two functions: discretising continuous input features and performing logical operations on these discretised variables. Furthermore, we demonstrate how different learning regimes (rich vs. lazy) have contrasting metric and curvature structures, affecting the ability of the networks to generalise to unseen inputs.

A simultaneous noise and input matching (SNIM) technique is used to provide robust input matching and noise performance during gain adjustment.

An established approach is to use estimators based on learned spectral features, that is, features spanning the top singular subspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. While powerful, such features are agnostic to the outcome variable. Consequently, the method can fail when the true causal function is poorly represented by these dominant singular functions. To mitigate, we introduce Augmented Spectral Feature Learning, a framework that makes the feature learning process outcome-aware.

Recent work has proposed explicit weight constructions to build such fact-storing MLPs, providing an improved understanding of LLM fact storage mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce an MLP construction framework that improves over previous constructions in three areas: it 1) works for all but a measure-zero set of feasible input-output pairs, 2) achieves asymptotically optimal parameter efficiency matching information-theoretic bounds for some embeddings, and 3) maintains usability within Transformers for factual recall. Through our improvements, we 1) discover a metric on value embeddings that characterizes facts-per-parameter scaling for both constructed and gradient-descent-trained MLPs, 2) identify a simple encoder-decoder mechanism that empirically matches gradient-descent MLP facts-per-parameter asymptotics across all the inputs and outputs we test, and 3) uncover a fundamental tradeoff between an MLP's fact-storage capacity and its usability within Transformers. Finally, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept application of fact-storing MLPs: modular fact editing on one-layer Transformers by \\textit{replacing entire MLPs at once}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684MLP\u6784\u9020\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728Transformer\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b58\u50a8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0eTransformer\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u5206\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5176MLP\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b58\u50a8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u6743\u91cd\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b58\u50a8\u673a\u5236\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u66f4\u591a\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301Transformer\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6539\u8fdb\u7684MLP\u6784\u9020\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1)\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\uff1b2)\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u67d0\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u754c\u9650\uff1b3)\u4fdd\u6301Transformer\u4e2d\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u5fc6\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53d1\u73b0\u4ef7\u503c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0eTransformer\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "1)\u53d1\u73b0\u4ef7\u503c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u8868\u5f81\u6784\u9020\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8bad\u7ec3MLP\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e-\u53c2\u6570\u7f29\u653e\uff1b2)\u8bc6\u522b\u7b80\u5355\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964dMLP\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e-\u53c2\u6570\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b3)\u63ed\u793aMLP\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0eTransformer\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff1b4)\u5c55\u793a\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e94\u7528\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u6362\u6574\u4e2aMLP\u5728\u4e00\u5c42Transformer\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MLP\u6784\u9020\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u548cTransformer\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b58\u50a8\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

A novel three-dimensional (3D) measurement procedure is proposed to capture comprehensive spatial characteristics, and its effectiveness in improving parameterization accuracy was verified using 28 GHz data. For parameterization, we developed a new method utilizing two dimensions of the high-bandwidth power delay profile-received power and delay spread-thereby fully leveraging the rich information provided by such measurements. Furthermore, we introduce the ER-BK hybrid model, which integrates the Beckmann-Kirchhoff (BK) model's high accuracy and cross-frequency adaptability with the Effective Roughness (ER) model's simplicity, applying it to the building surfaces. Our results show that diffuse scattering at 8 GHz and 12 GHz is highly similar, distinct from that at 28 GHz. A comparison revealed that the BK model provides a better fit for our FR3 measurement data.

Building dependable machine learning systems therefore requires methods that can both estimate predictive \\textit{uncertainty} and detect \\textit{out-of-distribution (OOD)} samples in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{TIE: a Training--Inversion--Exclusion} framework for visually interpretable and uncertainty-guided anomaly detection that jointly addresses these challenges through iterative refinement. TIE extends a standard $n$-class classifier to an $(n+1)$-class model by introducing a garbage class initialized with Gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. Within each epoch, TIE performs a closed-loop process of \\textit{training, inversion, and exclusion}, where highly uncertain inverted samples reconstructed from the just-trained classifier are excluded into the garbage class. Over successive iterations, the inverted samples transition from noisy artifacts into visually coherent class prototypes, providing transparent insight into how the model organizes its learned manifolds. During inference, TIE rejects OOD inputs by either directly mapping them to the garbage class or producing low-confidence, uncertain misclassifications within the in-distribution classes that are easily separable, all without relying on external OOD datasets. A comprehensive threshold-based evaluation using multiple OOD metrics and performance measures such as \\textit{AUROC}, \\textit{AUPR}, and \\textit{FPR@95\\%TPR} demonstrates that TIE offers a unified and interpretable framework for robust anomaly detection and calibrated uncertainty estimation (UE) achieving near-perfect OOD detection with \\textbf{\\(\\!\\approx\\!\\) 0 FPR@95\\%TPR} when trained on MNIST or FashionMNIST and tested against diverse unseen datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "TIE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3-\u53cd\u8f6c-\u6392\u9664\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u5783\u573e\u7c7b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8OOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u68c0\u6d4bOOD\u6837\u672c\u3002", "method": "TIE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5c06n\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a(n+1)\u7c7b\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u5783\u573e\u7c7b\uff1b2) \u6bcf\u4e2aepoch\u6267\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3-\u53cd\u8f6c-\u6392\u9664\u95ed\u73af\uff1a\u4ece\u521a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u53cd\u8f6c\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6392\u9664\u5230\u5783\u573e\u7c7b\uff1b3) \u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53cd\u8f6c\u6837\u672c\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u4f2a\u5f71\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u548cFashionMNIST\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cTIE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08\u22480 FPR@95%TPR\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "TIE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8OOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u70bc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u900f\u660e\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u5f62\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002"}}

Not Submitted to a conference", "summary": "With more devices competing for limited spectrum, dynamic spectrum sharing is increasingly vulnerable to interference from unauthorized emitters. This motivates fast detection and localization of these emitters using low-cost, distributed sensors that do not require precise time synchronization. This paper presents two convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches for multi-emitter detection and localization from sparsely sampled power maps. The first method performs single-stage prediction of existence probabilities and positions. The alternative two-stage method first estimates an occupancy map as an interpretable intermediate representation and then localizes emitters. A unified training objective combines binary cross entropy with coordinate regression loss and can handle an unknown emitter count. Small footprint networks, on the order of 70\\,k parameters, are trained and evaluated on simulated free-space and urban scenes. Experiments demonstrate that both approaches localize multiple emitters from sparse measurements across diverse environments, with the logits based two-stage variant remaining competitive, and in some cases superior, under extreme sensor sparsity. The findings indicate that small CNNs with a unified objective can be deployed for spectrum monitoring and localization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u529f\u7387\u56fe\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u591a\u4e2a\u672a\u6388\u6743\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u8c31\u5171\u4eab\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8bbe\u5907\u589e\u591a\u4e89\u593a\u6709\u9650\u9891\u8c31\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u8c31\u5171\u4eab\u6613\u53d7\u672a\u6388\u6743\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cdCNN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u7387\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b2) \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5148\u4f30\u8ba1\u5360\u7528\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u518d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u548c\u5750\u6807\u56de\u5f52\u635f\u5931\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u80fd\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u591a\u4e2a\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u6709\u6548\u3002\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7a00\u758f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u5c0f\u578bCNN\uff08\u7ea67\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7528\u4e8e\u9891\u8c31\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5c0f\u578bCNN\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u9891\u8c31\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u8c31\u5171\u4eab\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although they are frequently applied independently or sequentially to cluster observations, the relationship between them, especially when K-means is used to cluster variables rather than observations, has been scarcely explored. This study seeks to address this gap by proposing an innovative method that analyzes the relationship between clusters of variables obtained by applying K-means on transposed data and the principal components of PCA.

However, existing strategies are limited due to reliance on heuristic principles or poorly constrained generative tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a pretraining framework that exploits the information structure of a dynamical systems generative model across multiple time-series. This framework reveals our key insight that class identity can be efficiently captured by extracting information about the generative variables related to the system parameters shared across similar time series samples, while noise unique to individual samples should be discarded. Building on this insight, we propose PULSE, a cross-reconstruction-based pretraining objective for physiological time series datasets that explicitly extracts system information while discarding non-transferrable sample-specific ones. We establish theory that provides sufficient conditions for the system information to be recovered, and empirically validate it using a synthetic dynamical systems experiment. Furthermore, we apply our method to diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating that PULSE learns representations that can broadly distinguish semantic classes, increase label efficiency, and improve transfer learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPULSE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u91cd\u5efa\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4ece\u751f\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e22\u5f03\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u539f\u5219\u6216\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u5e95\u5c42\u751f\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u65e0\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPULSE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u91cd\u5efa\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u663e\u5f0f\u63d0\u53d6\u5171\u4eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e22\u5f03\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e94\u7528\u663e\u793aPULSE\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u6807\u7b7e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PULSE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u751f\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, developing robust decoding models remains challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG, its low signal-to-noise ratio, and the limited generalizability of many existing approaches across subjects and paradigms. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph-guided Clustering Mixture-of-Experts CNN-GRU (GCMCG), a novel unified framework for MI-ME EEG decoding. Our approach integrates a robust preprocessing stage using Independent Component Analysis and Wavelet Transform (ICA-WT) for effective denoising. We further introduce a pre-trainable graph tokenization module that dynamically models electrode relationships via a Graph Attention Network (GAT), followed by unsupervised spectral clustering to decompose signals into interpretable functional brain regions. Each region is processed by a dedicated CNN-GRU expert network, and a gated fusion mechanism with L1 regularization adaptively combines these local features with a global expert. This Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design enables deep spatio-temporal fusion and enhances representational capacity. A three-stage training strategy incorporating focal loss and progressive sampling is employed to improve cross-subject generalization and handle class imbalance. Evaluated on three public datasets of varying complexity (EEGmmidb-BCI2000, BCI-IV 2a, and M3CV), GCMCG achieves overall accuracies of 86.60%, 98.57%, and 99.61%, respectively, which demonstrates its superior effectiveness and strong generalization capability for practical BCI applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGCMCG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u60f3\u8c61EEG\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u9762\u4e34EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u590d\u6742\u3001\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4f4e\u3001\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u548c\u8303\u5f0f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGCMCG\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) ICA-WT\u9884\u5904\u7406\u53bb\u566a\uff1b2) \u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u7535\u6781\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u529f\u80fd\u8111\u533a\uff1b3) \u6bcf\u4e2a\u8111\u533a\u7531\u4e13\u7528CNN-GRU\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\uff1b4) \u5e26L1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b5) \u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7126\u70b9\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff1aEEGmmidb-BCI2000\u51c6\u786e\u738786.60%\uff0cBCI-IV 2a\u51c6\u786e\u738798.57%\uff0cM3CV\u51c6\u786e\u738799.61%\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GCMCG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86EEG\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645BCI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

From a discriminative perspective, it constructs transformed inputs as marginal log-density ratios that explicitly quantify how much more likely each feature value is under one class than another, thereby providing predictors with stronger class separation than the raw covariates. To support this framework, we develop a spline-based estimator for univariate log-density ratios that is flexible, robust, and computationally efficient.

However, common Neural Sheaf Diffusion implementations rely on SVD-based sheaf normalization and dense per-edge restriction maps, which scale with stalk dimension, require frequent Laplacian rebuilds, and yield brittle gradients. To address these limitations, we introduce Polynomial Neural Sheaf Diffusion (PolyNSD), a new sheaf diffusion approach whose propagation operator is a degree-K polynomial in a normalised sheaf Laplacian, evaluated via a stable three-term recurrence on a spectrally rescaled operator. This provides an explicit K-hop receptive field in a single layer (independently of the stalk dimension), with a trainable spectral response obtained as a convex mixture of K+1 orthogonal polynomial basis responses. PolyNSD enforces stability via convex mixtures, spectral rescaling, and residual/gated paths, reaching new state-of-the-art results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks, inverting the Neural Sheaf Diffusion trend by obtaining these results with just diagonal restriction maps, decoupling performance from large stalk dimension, while reducing runtime and memory requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "PolyNSD\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u5c42\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4f20\u64ad\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u9012\u5f52\u5b9e\u73b0K\u8df3\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0c\u7528\u5bf9\u89d2\u9650\u5236\u6620\u5c04\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u5c42\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56SVD\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u9650\u5236\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u91cd\u5efa\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u5c42\u6269\u6563(PolyNSD)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u7b97\u5b50\u7684K\u6b21\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u64ad\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e09\u9879\u9012\u5f52\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u51f8\u6df7\u5408\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u57fa\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u8c31\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u540c\u6027\u604b\u548c\u5f02\u6027\u604b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684SOTA\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u89d2\u9650\u5236\u6620\u5c04\u5373\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5c42\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "PolyNSD\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4f20\u64ad\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u5c42\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5c42\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In the additive white Gaussian broadcast channel with feedback (AWGN-BC-F), feedback can expand the channel capacity region beyond that of the no-feedback case, but linear analytical codes perform poorly with even small amounts of feedback noise. Deep learning enables the design of nonlinear feedback codes that are more resilient to feedback noise. We extend single-user learned feedback codes for the AWGN channel to the broadcast setting, and compare their performance with existing analytical codes, as well as a newly proposed analytical scheme inspired by the learned schemes.

They provide a unified framework for a variety of applications, including optimal transport (OT) and generative models. Despite their broad applicability, solving high-dimensional MFGs remains a significant challenge due to fundamental computational and analytical obstacles. In this work, we propose a particle-based deep Flow Matching (FM) method to tackle high-dimensional MFG computation. In each iteration of our proximal fixed-point scheme, particles are updated using first-order information, and a flow neural network is trained to match the velocity of the sample trajectories in a simulation-free manner. Theoretically, in the optimal control setting, we prove that our scheme converges to a stationary point sublinearly, and upgrade to linear (exponential) convergence under additional convexity assumptions. Our proof uses FM to induce an Eulerian coordinate (density-based) from a Lagrangian one (particle-based), and this also leads to certain equivalence results between the two formulations for MFGs when the Eulerian solution is sufficiently regular. Our method demonstrates promising performance on non-potential MFGs and high-dimensional OT problems cast as MFGs through a relaxed terminal-cost formulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u535a\u5f08\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u7aef\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u7c92\u5b50\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5339\u914d\u8f68\u8ff9\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5e76\u5728\u975e\u52bf\u80fdMFG\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u535a\u5f08\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4MFG\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd1\u7aef\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b2\uff09\u6bcf\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u7c92\u5b50\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b3\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u6837\u672c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\uff1b4\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5728\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u5750\u6807\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c92\u5b50\uff09\u548c\u6b27\u62c9\u5750\u6807\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff1a\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6848\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u989d\u5916\u51f8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5347\u7ea7\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\uff08\u6307\u6570\uff09\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u52bf\u80fdMFG\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u677e\u5f1b\u7ec8\u7aef\u6210\u672c\u516c\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aMFG\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u535a\u5f08\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u548c\u6b27\u62c9\u516c\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While scripted agents offer predictability and consistency in controlled environments, they fall short in dynamic, complex scenarios due to their inherent inflexibility. Conversely, RL agents excel in adaptability and learning, offering potential improvements in handling unforeseen situations, but suffer from significant challenges such as black-box decision-making processes and scalability issues in larger simulation environments. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) approach that synergizes the reliability and predictability of scripted agents with the dynamic, adaptive learning capabilities of RL. By structuring the AI system hierarchically, the proposed approach aims to utilize scripted agents for routine, tactical-level decisions and RL agents for higher-level, strategic decision-making, thus addressing the limitations of each method while leveraging their individual strengths. This integration is shown to significantly improve overall performance, providing a robust, adaptable, and effective solution for developing and training intelligent agents in complex simulation environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u6df7\u5408AI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u811a\u672c\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6218\u6597\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f00\u53d1", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6218\u6597\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f00\u53d1\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u811a\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u5177\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u6df7\u5408AI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728\u6218\u672f\u5c42\u9762\u4f7f\u7528\u811a\u672c\u4ee3\u7406\u5904\u7406\u5e38\u89c4\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5728\u6218\u7565\u5c42\u9762\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5c42\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u6df7\u5408AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u811a\u672c\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5404\u81ea\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6218\u6597\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We show that this norm can in fact encode meaningful information about the underlying statistical structure of the problem, and that exploiting this information leads to improved learning behavior. Motivated by this principle, we introduce Implicitly Normalized Online PCA (INO-PCA), an online PCA algorithm that removes the unit-norm constraint and instead allows the parameter norm to evolve dynamically through a simple regularized update. We prove that in the high-dimensional limit the joint empirical distribution of the estimate and the true component converges to a deterministic measure-valued process governed by a nonlinear PDE. This analysis reveals that the parameter norm obeys a closed-form ODE coupled with the cosine similarity, forming an internal state variable that regulates learning rate, stability, and sensitivity to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The resulting dynamics uncover a three-way relationship between the norm, SNR, and optimal step size, and expose a sharp phase transition in steady-state performance. Both theoretically and experimentally, we show that INO-PCA consistently outperforms Oja's algorithm and adapts rapidly in non-stationary environments. Overall, our results demonstrate that relaxing norm constraints can be a principled and effective way to encode and exploit problem-relevant information in online learning algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "INO-PCA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebfPCA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u6570\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8303\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eOja\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5728\u7ebfPCA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f3a\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u5411\u91cf\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u4e22\u5f03\u4e86\u8303\u6570\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u6570\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9690\u5f0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5728\u7ebfPCA\uff08INO-PCA\uff09\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u5355\u4f4d\u8303\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u8ba9\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u6570\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7531\u975e\u7ebf\u6027PDE\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6d4b\u503c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u6570\u4e0e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u5f62\u6210\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8303\u6570\u3001SNR\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u6b65\u957f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e09\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7a33\u6001\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u76f8\u53d8\u3002INO-PCA\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8eOja\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u653e\u677e\u8303\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u662f\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u5229\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002INO-PCA\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u8303\u6570\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8303\u6570\u4fe1\u606f\u6539\u5584\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

(ii) What level of position resolution is needed for accurate near-field beam focusing? (iii) How frequently must channel state information be updated to maintain highly directive bweamforming in dynamic scenarios? We develop an analytical framework for assessing near-field beamforming gain degradation due to mismatches between the focusing point and the coordinates of a user. Closed-form expressions for beam correlation, beam sensitivity to user movement, and the direction of fastest beamforming gain degradation are derived. A dynamic polar coordinate grid is also proposed for low complexity and adaptive near-field beam search. Furthermore, we introduce the novel concept of beam coherence time, quantifying the temporal robustness of focused beams and enabling proactive sensing-aided beam tracking strategies. The effect of microstrip losses on the preceding derivations is also analyzed.

We show these vulnerabilities arise from two factors: large gradient norms of forget-set samples and the close proximity of unlearned parameters to the original model. To demonstrate their severity, we propose unlearning-specific membership inference and reconstruction attacks, showing that several state-of-the-art methods (e.g., NGP, SCRUB) remain vulnerable. To mitigate this leakage, we introduce WARP, a plug-and-play teleportation defense that leverages neural network symmetries to reduce forget-set gradient energy and increase parameter dispersion while preserving predictions. This reparameterization obfuscates the signal of forgotten data, making it harder for attackers to distinguish forgotten samples from non-members or recover them via reconstruction. Across six unlearning algorithms, our approach achieves consistent privacy gains, reducing adversarial advantage (AUC) by up to 64% in black-box and 92% in white-box settings, while maintaining accuracy on retained data. These results highlight teleportation as a general tool for reducing attack success in approximate unlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faWARP\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd1\u4f3c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u5fd8\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u4f3c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u5fd8\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff1a\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u9057\u5fd8\u524d\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWARP\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u80fd\u91cf\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u79cd\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0cWARP\u5c06\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u4f18\u52bf\uff08AUC\uff09\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe64%\uff0c\u767d\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe92%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u662f\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9057\u5fd8\u4e2d\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0cWARP\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Three tenants provide services to their clients by sharing a common infrastructure of a set of UAVs. The content delivery tenant needs to guarantee that each of its clients (users) receives the required content, the sensing tenant aims to gather an adequate amount of uncorrelated data, and the MEC tenant provides computing service to its clients. An energy consumption minimization framework is considered to meet the tenants' requirements by optimizing the number of deployed UAVs, the deployment location of each UAV, the transmit power of each deployed UAV, the user-UAV association, and the transmission power as well as the computing resources of each UAV. Taking into account the spatial correlation among the sensing users, a subset of these users is activated to gather the required sensing information. A solution approach technique inherited from graph theory is presented, in which the Lagrange approach derives the transmission power and computing resource allocation expressions.

Being able to compare the organization of bipartite networks is a first step toward a better understanding of how environmental factors shape community structure and resilience. Yet current methods for structure detection in bipartite networks overlook shared patterns across collections of networks. We introduce the \\emph{colBiSBM}, a family of probabilistic models for collections of bipartite networks that extends the classical Latent Block Model (LBM). The proposed framework assumes that networks are independent realizations of a shared mesoscale structure, encoded through common inter-block connectivity parameters. We establish identifiability conditions for the different variants of \\emph{colBiSBM} and develop a variational EM algorithm for parameter estimation, coupled with an adaptation of the Integrated Classification Likelihood (ICL) criterion for model selection. We demonstrate how our approach can be used to classify networks based on their topology or organization. Simulation studies highlight the ability of \\emph{colBiSBM} to recover common structures, improve clustering performance, and enhance link prediction by borrowing strength across networks. An application to plant--pollinator networks highlights how the method uncovers shared ecological roles and partitions networks into sub-collections with similar connectivity patterns.

While efforts have been made to transfer the success of the foundation models in general AI domains to biology, existing works focus on directly adopting the existing foundation model architectures from general machine learning domains without a systematic design considering the unique physicochemical and structural properties of each biological data modality. This leads to suboptimal performance, as these repurposed architectures struggle to capture the long-range dependencies, sparse information, and complex underlying ``grammars'' inherent to biological data. To address this gap, we introduce BioArc, a novel framework designed to move beyond intuition-driven architecture design towards principled, automated architecture discovery for biological foundation models. Leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), BioArc systematically explores a vast architecture design space, evaluating architectures across multiple biological modalities while rigorously analyzing the interplay between architecture, tokenization, and training strategies. This large-scale analysis identifies novel, high-performance architectures, allowing us to distill a set of empirical design principles to guide future model development. Furthermore, to make the best of this set of discovered principled architectures, we propose and compare several architecture prediction methods that effectively and efficiently predict optimal architectures for new biological tasks.

Existing 3GPP-style models are often specified at discrete frequencies, introducing discontinuities in large-scale parameters (LSPs) at the 7.125 GHz boundary. To address this, we develop a unified framework anchored by rigorous double-directional measurements at 4.85 GHz in three representative UMa/UMi layouts. We derive route-specific statistics for path loss, delay and angular spreads, K-factor, and spatial consistency using robust distance-binning and bootstrap processing. Subsequently, we construct a log-log frequency-continuous LSP model spanning 4.85 to 28 GHz by anchoring these local statistics to complementary high-frequency datasets. The resulting models ensure smoothness across 7.125 GHz and systematically deviate from 3GPP trends, capturing weaker dispersion in urban macrocells (UMa) and stronger frequency-dependent compaction in urban microcells (UMi). The proposed parameter set fills the measurement gap around 4.85 GHz and provides a practical, implementation-ready basis for wideband 5G/6G simulations, mobility evaluation, and spectrum-planning activities across the FR1--FR3 interface.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9891\u7387\u8fde\u7eed\u76844.85-28 GHz\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u67093GPP\u6a21\u578b\u57287.125 GHz\u8fb9\u754c\u5904\u7684\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a5G/6G\u8fc7\u6e21\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "5G\u54116G\u8fc7\u6e21\u9700\u8981\u8de8FR1-FR3\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8fde\u7eed\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728WRC-27\u5173\u6ce8\u76844-8 GHz\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u533a\u57df\u3002\u73b0\u67093GPP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u9891\u7387\u4e0a\u6307\u5b9a\uff0c\u57287.125 GHz\u8fb9\u754c\u5904\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5178\u578bUMa/UMi\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c4.85 GHz\u53cc\u5b9a\u5411\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u7bb1\u548cbootstrap\u5904\u7406\u83b7\u5f97\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u89d2\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u3001K\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b49\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u90e8\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u951a\u5b9a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa4.85-28 GHz\u7684\u5bf9\u6570-\u5bf9\u6570\u9891\u7387\u8fde\u7eedLSP\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u4fdd\u57287.125 GHz\u5904\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u4e0e3GPP\u8d8b\u52bf\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u57ce\u5e02\u5b8f\u8702\u7a9d(UMa)\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f31\u7684\u8272\u6563\uff0c\u57ce\u5e02\u5fae\u8702\u7a9d(UMi)\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7d27\u51d1\u3002\u586b\u8865\u4e864.85 GHz\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u96c6\u4e3a\u5bbd\u5e265G/6G\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548cFR1-FR3\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u89c4\u5212\u6d3b\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, a single tree suffers from high estimation variance, while large ensembles reduce this variance at the cost of substantial computational overhead and diminished interpretability. In this paper, we propose Decision Tree Embedding (DTE), a fast and effective method that leverages the leaf partitions of a trained classification tree to construct an interpretable feature representation. By using the sample means within each leaf region as anchor points, DTE maps inputs into an embedding space defined by the tree's partition structure, effectively circumventing the high variance inherent in decision-tree splitting rules. We further introduce an ensemble extension based on additional bootstrap trees, and pair the resulting embedding with linear discriminant analysis for classification. We establish several population-level theoretical properties of DTE, including its preservation of conditional density under mild conditions and a characterization of the resulting classification error. Empirical studies on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that DTE strikes a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming or matching random forest and shallow neural networks while requiring only a fraction of their training time in most cases. Overall, the proposed DTE method can be viewed either as a scalable decision tree classifier that improves upon standard split rules, or as a neural network model whose weights are learned from tree-derived anchor points, achieving an intriguing integration of both paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "DTE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u53f6\u5206\u533a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53f6\u533a\u57df\u6837\u672c\u5747\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u951a\u70b9\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5206\u88c2\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u68f5\u6811\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53c8\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "DTE\u5229\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6811\u7684\u53f6\u5206\u533a\u6784\u5efa\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53f6\u533a\u57df\u5185\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5747\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u5206\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u989d\u5916bootstrap\u6811\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u5224\u522b\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cDTE\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5339\u914d\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u6d45\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "DTE\u65e2\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u4f5c\u6539\u8fdb\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u88c2\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u4f5c\u6743\u91cd\u4ece\u6811\u6d3e\u751f\u7684\u951a\u70b9\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u8da3\u6574\u5408\u3002"}}

Physics-based vehicle models are often simplified for tractability and therefore exhibit inherent model-form uncertainty, motivating the need for data-driven correction. Moreover, non-autonomous dynamics are governed by time-dependent control inputs, which pose challenges in learning predictive models directly from temporal snapshot data. To address these, we reformulate the vehicle dynamics via a local parameterization of the time-dependent inputs, yielding a modified system composed of a sequence of local parametric dynamical systems. We approximate these parametric systems using two complementary approaches. First, we employ the DRIPS (dimension reduction and interpolation in parameter space) methodology to construct efficient linear surrogate models, equipped with lifted observable spaces and manifold-based operator interpolation. This enables data-efficient learning of vehicle models whose dynamics admit accurate linear representations in the lifted spaces. Second, for more strongly nonlinear systems, we employ FML (Flow Map Learning), a deep neural network approach that approximates the parametric evolution map without requiring special treatment of nonlinearities. We further extend FML with a transfer-learning-based model correction procedure, enabling the correction of misspecified prior models using only a sparse set of high-fidelity or experimental measurements, without assuming a prescribed form for the correction term. Through a suite of numerical experiments on unicycle, simplified bicycle, and slip-based bicycle models, we demonstrate that DRIPS offers robust and highly data-efficient learning of non-autonomous vehicle dynamics, while FML provides expressive nonlinear modeling and effective correction of model-form errors under severe data scarcity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u975e\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5305\u542bDRIPS\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548cFML\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5904\u7406\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u7406\u8f66\u8f86\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u56e0\u7b80\u5316\u800c\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u975e\u81ea\u4e3b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53d7\u65f6\u53d8\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u53d8\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cd\u6784\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528DRIPS\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u63d0\u5347\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6d41\u5f62\u7b97\u5b50\u63d2\u503c\uff09\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528FML\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53c2\u6570\u6f14\u5316\u6620\u5c04\uff1b4) \u6269\u5c55FML\u652f\u6301\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u72ec\u8f6e\u8f66\u3001\u7b80\u5316\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u3001\u6ed1\u79fb\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u8868\u660e\uff1aDRIPS\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0cFML\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u578b\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u975e\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0cDRIPS\u9002\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0cFML\u9002\u5408\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u4e92\u8865\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

However, existing three-dimensional structures, such as stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), face critical challenges in implementation and integration. In contrast, this work pioneers planar diffractive neural networks (PDNNs) empowered communications, a novel architecture that performs signal processing as signals propagate through artificially designed planar circuits. To demonstrate the capability of PDNN, we propose a PDNN-based space-shift-keying (PDNN-SSK) communication system with a single radio-frequency (RF) chain and a maximum power detector. In this system, PDNNs are deployed at both the transmitter and receiver to jointly execute modulation, beamforming, and detection. We conduct theoretical analyses to provide the maximization condition of correct detection probability and derive the closed-form expression of the symbol error rate (SER) for the proposed system. To approach these theoretical benchmarks, the phase shift parameters of PDNNs are optimized using a surrogate model-based training approach, which effectively navigates the high-dimensional, non-convex optimization landscape.

A common approach involves simulating the time-reversal of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process initialized at the true data distribution. Since the score function associated with the OU process is typically unknown, it is approximated using a trained neural network. This approximation, along with finite time simulation, time discretization and statistical approximation, introduce several sources of error whose impact on the generated samples must be carefully understood. Previous analyses have quantified the error between the generated and the true data distributions in terms of Wasserstein distance or Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, both metrics present limitations: KL divergence requires absolute continuity between distributions, while Wasserstein distance, though more general, leads to error bounds that scale poorly with dimension, rendering them impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we derive an explicit, dimension-free bound on the discrepancy between the generated and the true data distributions. The bound is expressed in terms of a smooth test functional with bounded first and second derivatives. The key novelty lies in the use of this weaker, functional metric to obtain dimension-independent guarantees, at the cost of higher regularity on the test functions. As an application, we formulate and solve a variational problem to minimize the time-discretization error, leading to the derivation of an optimal time-scheduling strategy for the reverse-time diffusion. Interestingly, this scheduler has appeared previously in the literature in a different context; our analysis provides a new justification for its optimality, now grounded in minimizing the discretization bias in generative sampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u754c\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u5149\u6ed1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cdb\u51fd\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bef\u5dee\u6e90\uff1a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3001\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6790\u4f7f\u7528Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1aKL\u6563\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u5206\u5e03\u7edd\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\uff0cWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u7f29\u653e\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u6709\u754c\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u5149\u6ed1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cdb\u51fd\u6765\u5ea6\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u95ee\u9898\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u53cd\u5411\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u8be5\u754c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5148\u524d\u51fa\u73b0\u4f46\u80cc\u666f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5f31\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cdb\u51fd\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers significant potential for this field, especially from the cross-modality aspect. Most methods adopt an LLM-as-Predictor paradigm, using LLM as the forecasting backbone and designing modality alignment mechanisms to enable LLM to understand time series data. However, the semantic information in the two modalities of time series and text differs significantly, making it challenging for LLM to fully understand time series data. To mitigate this challenge, our work follows an LLM-as-Enhancer paradigm to fully utilize the advantage of LLM in text understanding, where LLM is only used to encode text modality to complement time series modality. Based on this paradigm, we propose FiCoTS, an LLM-enhanced fine-to-coarse framework for multimodal time series forecasting. Specifically, the framework facilitates progressive cross-modality interaction by three levels in a fine-to-coarse scheme: First, in the token-level modality alignment module, a dynamic heterogeneous graph is constructed to filter noise and align time series patches with text tokens; Second, in the feature-level modality interaction module, a global cross-attention mechanism is introduced to enable each time series variable to connect with relevant textual contexts; Third, in the decision-level modality fusion module, we design a gated network to adaptively fuse the results of the two modalities for robust predictions.

Comparative study involving Apache Spark and Hyperparameter Optimization. Keywords: Big Data, NLP, Tabular Data", "summary": "This study analyzes the impact of heterogeneity (\"Variety\") in Big Data by comparing classification strategies across structured (Epsilon) and unstructured (Rest-Mex, IMDB) domains. A dual methodology was implemented: evolutionary and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization (Genetic Algorithms, Optuna) in Python for numerical data, and distributed processing in Apache Spark for massive textual corpora. The results reveal a \"complexity paradox\": in high-dimensional spaces, optimized linear models (SVM, Logistic Regression) outperformed deep architectures and Gradient Boosting. Conversely, in text-based domains, the constraints of distributed fine-tuning led to overfitting in complex models, whereas robust feature engineering -- specifically Transformer-based embeddings (ROBERTa) and Bayesian Target Encoding -- enabled simpler models to generalize effectively.

Most MC literature focuses on particle properties, even though many natural phenomena exhibit wave-like behavior. One such signal is sound waves. Understanding how sound waves are used in nature can help us better utilize this signal in our interactions with our environment. To take a step in this direction, in this paper, we examine how plants process incoming sound waves and take informed actions. Indeed, plants respond to sound, yet no quantitative communication-theoretic model currently explains this behavior. This study develops the first end-to-end acoustic communication framework for plants. The model is formed following the biological steps of the incoming signal, and a mathematical description is constructed at each step following basic biological models. The resulting end-to-end communication-theoretic model is analyzed using MATLAB. Simulations show that a $200$ $Hz$, $20$ $mu Pa$ stimulus elevates cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ from $150$ $nM$ to $230 \\pm 10$ $nM$ within $50$ seconds which can cause root bending in plants in the long run.

Coordinating the resource allocation strategies efficiently across BSs to ensure stable network service poses significant challenges, especially when each utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. This paper considers formulating the resource allocation among spectrum sharing BSs as a non-cooperative game, with the goal of aligning their allocation incentives toward a stable outcome. To address this challenge, we propose PPR-UCB, a novel Bayesian optimization (BO) strategy that learns from sequential decision-evaluation pairs to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. PPR-UCB applies martingale techniques to Gaussian process (GP) surrogates and constructs high probability confidence bounds for utilities uncertainty quantification.

Leveraging on balance theory that deduces edge signs from multi-hop node pairs, signed graph learning can generate node embeddings that preserve both structural and sign information. However, training on sensitive signed graphs raises significant privacy concerns, as model parameters may leak private link information. Existing protection methods with differential privacy (DP) typically rely on edge or gradient perturbation for unsigned graph protection. Yet, they are not well-suited for signed graphs, mainly because edge perturbation tends to cascading errors in edge sign inference under balance theory, while gradient perturbation increases sensitivity due to node interdependence and gradient polarity change caused by sign flips, resulting in larger noise injection. In this paper, motivated by the robustness of adversarial learning to noisy interactions, we present ASGL, a privacy-preserving adversarial signed graph learning method that preserves high utility while achieving node-level DP. We first decompose signed graphs into positive and negative subgraphs based on edge signs, and then design a gradient-perturbed adversarial module to approximate the true signed connectivity distribution. In particular, the gradient perturbation helps mitigate cascading errors, while the subgraph separation facilitates sensitivity reduction. Further, we devise a constrained breadth-first search tree strategy that fuses with balance theory to identify the edge signs between generated node pairs. This strategy also enables gradient decoupling, thereby effectively lowering gradient sensitivity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that ASGL achieves favorable privacy-utility trade-offs across multiple downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "ASGL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u5b50\u56fe\u5206\u79bb\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5904\u7406\u654f\u611f\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fb9\u6270\u52a8\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e73\u8861\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u7684\u7ea7\u8054\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u68af\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u5219\u56e0\u8282\u70b9\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u7ffb\u8f6c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6781\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u6309\u8fb9\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6b63\u8d1f\u5b50\u56fe\uff1b2) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u68af\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u8fde\u63a5\u5206\u5e03\uff1b3) \u5f00\u53d1\u7ea6\u675f\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u6811\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u8861\u7406\u8bba\u8bc6\u522b\u751f\u6210\u8282\u70b9\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fb9\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u68af\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cASGL\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u5229\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "ASGL\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u5b50\u56fe\u5206\u79bb\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3002"}}

Radio frequency ISAC (RF-ISAC) is constrained by spectrum crowding, limited sensing resolution, and susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. In contrast, optical ISAC (O-ISAC) leverages the large bandwidth and short wavelength of optical carriers and is regarded as an important complement to RF-ISAC. However, conventional O-ISAC relies on natural optical reflections from target surfaces, which generate weak echoes that are highly dependent on surface materials, thereby limiting the achievable sensing range and sensing accuracy. This article introduces retroreflective optical ISAC (RO-ISAC), which alleviates these limitations by equipping targets with compact retroreflective modules. These modules return incident light approximately back to the source over a useful range of incidence angles, forming a well controlled double pass optical path with strong and stable echoes, and thereby further unlocking the application potential of O-ISAC. The conceptual architecture of RO-ISAC is presented together with the underlying retroreflection mechanism. Key enabling technologies for RO-ISAC systems are discussed, including channel modeling, waveform design, bidirectional transmission, and multi-target sensing and communication, with representative details and experimental validation. The suitability of RO-ISAC is analyzed in indoor, aerial, underwater, and satellite scenarios, and challenges and research directions related to mobility, cooperative networking, intelligent operation, and sustainable deployment are outlined, pointing toward robust and scalable RO-ISAC deployment in future 6G networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u9006\u5411\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u5b66\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08RO-ISAC\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u5b89\u88c5\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u9006\u5411\u53cd\u5c04\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u5b66ISAC\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u7136\u53cd\u5c04\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f31\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u901a\u4fe1\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5c04\u9891ISAC\u9762\u4e34\u9891\u8c31\u62e5\u6324\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6709\u9650\u548c\u6613\u53d7\u7535\u78c1\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5149\u5b66ISAC\u867d\u7136\u5229\u7528\u5149\u8f7d\u6ce2\u7684\u5927\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u77ed\u6ce2\u957f\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u9762\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5149\u5b66\u53cd\u5c04\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56de\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f31\u4e14\u53d7\u8868\u9762\u6750\u6599\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRO-ISAC\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u9006\u5411\u53cd\u5c04\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u5165\u5c04\u5149\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8fd4\u56de\u5149\u6e90\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u5149\u8def\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u800c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u56de\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u6ce2\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u53cc\u5411\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u901a\u4fe1\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "RO-ISAC\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u800c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u56de\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u3001\u7a7a\u4e2d\u3001\u6c34\u4e0b\u548c\u536b\u661f\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RO-ISAC\u4f5c\u4e3aRF-ISAC\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u5411\u53cd\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u5b66ISAC\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u901a\u4fe1\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u5305\u62ec\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u7ec4\u7f51\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u90e8\u7f72\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we propose Knowledge Tracing Leveraging Problem-Solving Process (KT-PSP), which incorporates students' problem-solving processes to capture the multidimensional aspects of mathematical proficiency. We also introduce KT-PSP-25, a new dataset specifically designed for the KT-PSP. Building on this, we present StatusKT, a KT framework that employs a teacher-student-teacher three-stage LLM pipeline to extract students' MP as intermediate signals.

Conventional laboratory diagnostics, such as full charge-discharge cycling, pulse tests, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, and thermal characterization, provide accurate degradation information but are too time-consuming, equipment-intensive, or condition-sensitive to be applied at scale during retirement-stage sorting, leaving real-world datasets fragmented and inconsistent. This review synthesizes recent advances that address these constraints through physical health indicators, experiment testing methods, data-generation and augmentation techniques, and a spectrum of learning-based modeling routes spanning supervised, semi-supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised paradigms. We highlight how minimal-test features, synthetic data, domain-invariant representations, and uncertainty-aware prediction enable robust inference under limited or approximate labels and across mixed chemistries and operating histories. A comparative evaluation further reveals trade-offs in accuracy, interpretability, scalability, and computational burden.

This work targets per-cell per-beam radio mapping from 5G new radio (NR) synchronization signal (SS) burst sets. Conventional processing treats interference as noise and focuses on the strongest link, which is insufficient to comprehensive awareness of the radio environment and ineffective in dense multi-cell low-altitude scenarios. We propose a successive waveform reconstruction and cancellation framework that iteratively estimates, reconstructs, and subtracts the SSs of stronger BSs, thereby enabling reliable detection and estimation of ultra-weak signals. To support this, we introduce the notion of a carrier frequency offset (CFO)-coherent block within which a common-CFO/per-synchronization signal block (SSB)-channel model holds and design a joint CFO-channel estimator that coherently aggregates multiple SSBs within each CFO-coherent block. We further derive closed-form scaling laws that relate estimation accuracy to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) speed, motion geometry, burst periodicity, and the length of the CFO-coherent block. Simulations show that the proposed framework can detect and estimate SSs at signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) levels down to -30 dB. Field tests at 150 m altitude demonstrate per-beam coverage maps for more than ten overlapping BSs and reveal that, despite strong received power, the measured SINR rarely exceeds 10 dB, underscoring the need for careful interference management in low-altitude airspace.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e5G NR\u540c\u6b65\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2\u5f62\u91cd\u6784\u4e0e\u6d88\u9664\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7a7a\u591a\u57fa\u7ad9\u5bc6\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230-30dB SINR\u7684\u5fae\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u5730\u9762\u7f51\u7edc\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7a7a\u57df\u662f\u652f\u6301\u7a7a\u4e2d\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5e72\u6270\u89c6\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u5f3a\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u591a\u57fa\u7ad9\u4f4e\u7a7a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u611f\u77e5\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2\u5f62\u91cd\u6784\u4e0e\u6d88\u9664\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u51cf\u53bb\u8f83\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ad9\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d85\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u8f7d\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u76f8\u5e72\u5757\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8054\u5408CFO-\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7a81\u53d1\u5468\u671f\u6027\u548cCFO\u76f8\u5e72\u5757\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728SINR\u4f4e\u81f3-30dB\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u540c\u6b65\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002150\u7c73\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u73b0\u573a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5341\u591a\u4e2a\u91cd\u53e0\u57fa\u7ad9\u7684\u6bcf\u6ce2\u675f\u8986\u76d6\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5c3d\u7ba1\u63a5\u6536\u529f\u7387\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u6d4bSINR\u5f88\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc710dB\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7a7a\u57df\u9700\u8981\u4ed4\u7ec6\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2\u5f62\u91cd\u6784\u4e0e\u6d88\u9664\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u7a7a\u5bc6\u96c6\u591a\u57fa\u7ad9\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7a7a\u57df\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While the application of Transformers to communication systems is a burgeoning field, the notion of context within physical waveforms remains under-explored. This paper addresses that gap by re-examining inter-symbol contribution (ISC) caused by pulse-shaping overlap. Rather than treating ISC as a nuisance, we view it as a deterministic source of contextual information embedded in oversampled complex baseband signals. We propose Masked Symbol Modeling (MSM), a framework for the physical (PHY) layer inspired by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers methodology. In MSM, a subset of symbol aligned samples is randomly masked, and a Transformer predicts the missing symbol identifiers using the surrounding \"in-between\" samples. Through this objective, the model learns the latent syntax of complex baseband waveforms. We illustrate MSM's potential by applying it to the task of demodulating signals corrupted by impulsive noise, where the model infers corrupted segments by leveraging the learned context. Our results suggest a path toward receivers that interpret, rather than merely detect communication signals, opening new avenues for context-aware PHY layer design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u63a9\u7801\u7b26\u53f7\u5efa\u6a21\uff08MSM\uff09\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06Transformer\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u9884\u6d4b\u601d\u60f3\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u7b26\u53f7\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u975e\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u5e26\u6ce2\u5f62\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136Transformer\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u9884\u6d4b\u6210\u529f\u6355\u83b7\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u6ce2\u5f62\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6982\u5ff5\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff08ISC\uff09\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u770b\u4f5c\u662f\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u590d\u57fa\u5e26\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a9\u7801\u7b26\u53f7\u5efa\u6a21\uff08MSM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d7BERT\u65b9\u6cd5\u542f\u53d1\u3002\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u7b26\u53f7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u6839\u636e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\"\u4e2d\u95f4\"\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u6807\u8bc6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u57fa\u5e26\u6ce2\u5f62\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5c06MSM\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u53d7\u8109\u51b2\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u65ad\u53d7\u635f\u7247\u6bb5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\"\u89e3\u91ca\"\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\"\u68c0\u6d4b\"\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "MSM\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06Transformer\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f7f\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

Existing theoretical studies in this area suffer from at least two of the following obstacles: memory inefficiency, the heavy dependence of sample complexity on the long horizon and the large state space, the high computational complexity, non-Markov policy, non-Nash policy, and high burn-in cost. In this work, we take a step towards settling this problem by designing a model-free self-play algorithm \\emph{Memory-Efficient Nash Q-Learning (ME-Nash-QL)} for two-player zero-sum Markov games, which is a specific setting of MARL. ME-Nash-QL is proven to enjoy the following merits. First, it can output an $\\varepsilon$-approximate Nash policy with space complexity $O(SABH)$ and sample complexity $\\widetilde{O}(H^4SAB/\\varepsilon^2)$, where $S$ is the number of states, $\\{A, B\\}$ is the number of actions for two players, and $H$ is the horizon length. It outperforms existing algorithms in terms of space complexity for tabular cases, and in terms of sample complexity for long horizons, i.e., when $\\min\\{A, B\\}\\ll H^2$. Second, ME-Nash-QL achieves the lowest computational complexity $O(T\\mathrm{poly}(AB))$ while preserving Markov policies, where $T$ is the number of samples. Third, ME-Nash-QL also achieves the best burn-in cost $O(SAB\\,\\mathrm{poly}(H))$, whereas previous algorithms have a burn-in cost of at least $O(S^3 AB\\,\\mathrm{poly}(H))$ to attain the same level of sample complexity with ours.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u4eba\u96f6\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9ad8\u6548\u7eb3\u4ec0Q\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u70ed\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u969c\u788d\uff1a\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bf9\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u548c\u5927\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e25\u91cd\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u975e\u7eb3\u4ec0\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u9884\u70ed\u6210\u672c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u7b97\u6cd5ME-Nash-QL\uff08\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9ad8\u6548\u7eb3\u4ec0Q\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u4eba\u96f6\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528Q\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "ME-Nash-QL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4f18\u52bf\uff1a1\uff09\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6O(SABH)\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u00d5(H\u2074SAB/\u03b5\u00b2)\uff1b2\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6O(Tpoly(AB))\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3\uff09\u9884\u70ed\u6210\u672cO(SABpoly(H))\uff0c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684O(S\u00b3ABpoly(H))\u3002", "conclusion": "ME-Nash-QL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Due to environmental uncertainties, policies in MARL must remain robust to tackle the sim-to-real gap. We focus on robust two-player zero-sum Markov games (TZMGs) in offline settings, specifically on tabular robust TZMGs (RTZMGs). We propose a model-based algorithm (\\textit{RTZ-VI-LCB}) for offline RTZMGs, which is optimistic robust value iteration combined with a data-driven Bernstein-style penalty term for robust value estimation. By accounting for distribution shifts in the historical dataset, the proposed algorithm establishes near-optimal sample complexity guarantees under partial coverage and environmental uncertainty. An information-theoretic lower bound is developed to confirm the tightness of our algorithm's sample complexity, which is optimal regarding both state and action spaces.

Radio map is a spatial representation of signal characteristics across different locations in a given area, which serves as a key tool for enabling precise spectrum management. To generate accurate radio maps, extensive research efforts have been made. However, most existing studies are conducted on simulation data, which differs significantly from real-world data and cannot accurately reflect the spectrum characteristics of practical environments. To tackle this problem, we construct a dataset of real-world radio map with a self-developed measurement system. Due to the limited volume of real-world data and the distributional discrepancies between simulation and real-world data, we propose a Pixel Transformer (PiT)- based model enhanced with the test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, named RadioPiT, for real-world radio map generation.

Existing methods fail to mitigate perturbations while addressing partial observability. We propose \\textit{Causal State Representation under Asynchronous Diffusion Model (CaDiff)}, a framework that enhances any RL algorithm by uncovering the underlying causal structure of P$^2$OMDPs. This is achieved by incorporating a novel asynchronous diffusion model (ADM) and a new bisimulation metric. ADM enables forward and reverse processes with different numbers of steps, thus interpreting the perturbation of P$^2$OMDP as part of the noise suppressed through diffusion. The bisimulation metric quantifies the similarity between partially observable environments and their causal counterparts. Moreover, we establish the theoretical guarantee of CaDiff by deriving an upper bound for the value function approximation errors between perturbed observations and denoised causal states, reflecting a principled trade-off between approximation errors of reward and transition-model. Experiments on Roboschool tasks show that CaDiff enhances returns by at least 14.18\\% compared to baselines.

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a key technique for creating lightweight student models, with recent advances like frequency-aware KD successfully preserving spectral properties (i.e., high-frequency details and low-frequency trends). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by operating on pixel-level signals, leaving them blind to the rich semantic and causal context behind the visual patterns. To overcome this limitation, we introduce S^2-KD, a novel framework that unifies Semantic priors with Spectral representations for distillation. Our approach begins by training a privileged, multimodal teacher model. This teacher leverages textual narratives from a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) to reason about the underlying causes of events, while its architecture simultaneously decouples spectral components in its latent space. The core of our framework is a new distillation objective that transfers this unified semantic-spectral knowledge into a lightweight, vision-only student. Consequently, the student learns to make predictions that are not only spectrally accurate but also semantically coherent, without requiring any textual input or architectural overhead at inference. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like WeatherBench and TaxiBJ+ show that S^2-KD significantly boosts the performance of simple student models, enabling them to outperform state-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-horizon and complex non-stationary scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "S^2-KD\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u9891\u8c31\u8868\u793a\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5f0f\u80cc\u540e\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faS^2-KD\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u6743\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u672c\u53d9\u8ff0\u7406\u89e3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u56e0\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bed\u4e49-\u9891\u8c31\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728WeatherBench\u548cTaxiBJ+\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cS^2-KD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7b80\u5355\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u548c\u590d\u6742\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "S^2-KD\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u9891\u8c31\u8868\u793a\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4f7f\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u505a\u51fa\u65e2\u9891\u8c31\u51c6\u786e\u53c8\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u989d\u5916\u67b6\u6784\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

In this paper, we study ICL for deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) in image transmission over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where an ICL denoiser is employed for MIMO symbol estimation. We first study the transceiver without any hardware impairments and explore the integration of transformer-based ICL with DeepJSCC in both open-loop and closed-loop MIMO systems, depending on the availability of channel state information (CSI) at the transceiver. For both open-loop and closed-loop scenarios, we propose two MIMO transceiver architectures that leverage context information, i.e., pilot sequences and their outputs, as additional inputs, enabling the DeepJSCC encoder, DeepJSCC decoder, and the ICL denoiser to jointly learn encoding, decoding, and estimation strategies tailored to each channel realization. Next, we extend our study to a more challenging scenario where the transceiver suffers from in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance, resulting in nonlinear MIMO estimation. In this case, the context information is also exploited, facilitating joint learning across the DeepJSCC encoder, decoder, and the ICL denoiser under hardware impairments and varying channel conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that the ICL denoiser for MIMO estimation significantly outperforms the conventional least-squares method, with even greater advantages under IQ imbalance. Moreover, the proposed transformer-based ICL framework, integrated with contextual information, achieves significant improvements in end-to-end image reconstruction quality under transceiver IQ imbalance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u8054\u5408\u4fe1\u6e90\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\uff08DeepJSCC\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5bfc\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b58\u5728IQ\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u4f20\u7edfMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\uff09\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\uff08\u5982IQ\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff09\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5c06ICL\u4e0eDeepJSCC\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684ICL\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u7528\u4e8eMIMO\u7b26\u53f7\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b2. \u9488\u5bf9\u5f00\u73af\u548c\u95ed\u73afMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u6536\u53d1\u673a\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bfc\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u53ca\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3. \u5c06DeepJSCC\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548cICL\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4fe1\u9053\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\uff1b4. \u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5b58\u5728IQ\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027MIMO\u4f30\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "1.

Most existing cuffless BP estimation methods use only photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals, alone or in combination. These models are typically developed under resting or quasi-static conditions and struggle to maintain robust accuracy in multi-motion-state scenarios. In this study, we propose a six-modal BP estimation framework that jointly leverages ECG, multi-channel PPG, attachment pressure, sensor temperature, and triaxial acceleration and angular velocity. Each modality is processed by a lightweight branch encoder, contrastive learning enforces cross-modal semantic alignment, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) regression head adaptively maps the fused features to BP across motion states. Comprehensive experiments on the public Pulse Transit Time PPG Dataset, which includes running, walking, and sitting data from 22 subjects, show that the proposed method achieves mean absolute errors (MAE) of 3.60 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and 3.01 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). From a clinical perspective, it attains Grade A for SBP, DBP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol and meets the numerical criteria of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard for mean error (ME) and standard deviation of error (SDE).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u516d\u6a21\u6001\u8840\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ECG\u3001\u591a\u901a\u9053PPG\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u538b\u529b\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u4e09\u8f74\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u8840\u538b\u76d1\u6d4b", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u8981\u6b7b\u56e0\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u662f\u6c89\u9ed8\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8ePPG\u548cECG\u7684\u8840\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9759\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u516d\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff1aECG\u3001\u591a\u901a\u9053PPG\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u538b\u529b\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u4e09\u8f74\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u7531\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u652f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u56de\u5f52\u5934\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6620\u5c04\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u8840\u538b\u503c", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b22\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u8dd1\u6b65\u3001\u884c\u8d70\u3001\u5750\u59ff\u6570\u636e\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6536\u7f29\u538bMAE\u4e3a3.60 mmHg\uff0c\u8212\u5f20\u538bMAE\u4e3a3.01 mmHg\u3002\u6839\u636eBHS\u534f\u8bae\u83b7\u5f97SBP\u3001DBP\u548cMAP\u7684A\u7ea7\u8bc4\u7ea7\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3AAMI\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u6570\u503c\u6807\u51c6", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u516d\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u8840\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u8896\u5e26\u8fde\u7eed\u8840\u538b\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

In this work, we present PrexSyn, an efficient and programmable model for molecular discovery within synthesizable chemical space. PrexSyn is based on a decoder-only transformer trained on a billion-scale datastream of synthesizable pathways paired with molecular properties, enabled by a real-time, high-throughput C++-based data generation engine. The large-scale training data allows PrexSyn to reconstruct the synthesizable chemical space nearly perfectly at a high inference speed and learn the association between properties and synthesizable molecules. Based on its learned property-pathway mappings, PrexSyn can generate synthesizable molecules that satisfy not only single-property conditions but also composite property queries joined by logical operators, thereby allowing users to ``program'' generation objectives. Moreover, by exploiting this property-based querying capability, PrexSyn can efficiently optimize molecules against black-box oracle functions via iterative query refinement, achieving higher sampling efficiency than even synthesis-agnostic baselines, making PrexSyn a powerful general-purpose molecular optimization tool. Overall, PrexSyn pushes the frontier of synthesizable molecular design by setting a new state of the art in synthesizable chemical space coverage, molecular sampling efficiency, and inference speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "PrexSyn\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u5668Transformer\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u5206\u5b50\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5341\u4ebf\u7ea7\u5408\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u7f8e\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u903b\u8f91\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6240\u9700\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u8986\u76d6\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u5173\u8054\u5206\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u5668Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u5341\u4ebf\u7ea7\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u7531\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u901a\u91cfC++\u5f15\u64ce\u751f\u6210\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5c5e\u6027-\u8def\u5f84\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u903b\u8f91\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "PrexSyn\u5728\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0SOTA\u3002\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u7f8e\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u65e0\u5173\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "PrexSyn\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5c5e\u6027-\u8def\u5f84\u6620\u5c04\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53ef\u5408\u6210\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

By combining heterogeneous sensing modalities such as visual, radar, lidar, and positional information, multimodal ISAC can improve both situational awareness and robustness of LAWNs. However, most existing multimodal fusion approaches use static fusion strategies that treat all modalities equally and cannot adapt to channel heterogeneity or time-varying modality reliability in dynamic low-altitude environments. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for multimodal ISAC in LAWNs. Each modality is processed by a dedicated expert network, and a lightweight gating module adaptively assigns fusion weights according to the instantaneous informativeness and reliability of each modality. To improve scalability under the stringent energy constraints of aerial platforms, we further develop a sparse MoE variant that selectively activates only a subset of experts, thereby reducing computation overhead while preserving the benefits of adaptive fusion.

While such games often involve non-convex non-concave objectives, empirical evidence shows that simple gradient methods frequently converge, suggesting a hidden geometric structure. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that explains this phenomenon through the lens of hidden convexity and overparameterization. We identify sufficient conditions - spanning initialization, training dynamics, and network width - that guarantee global convergence to a NE in a broad class of non-convex min-max games. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for games that involve two-layer neural networks. Technically, our approach is twofold: (a) we derive a novel path-length bound for the alternating gradient descent-ascent scheme in min-max games; and (b) we show that the reduction from a hidden convex-concave geometry to two-sided Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz (P\u0141) min-max condition hold with high probability under overparameterization, using tools from random matrix theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u53cc\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u975e\u51f9\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u95f4\u7684\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u901a\u5e38\u975e\u51f8\u975e\u51f9\u3002\u7ecf\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u7b80\u5355\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u85cf\u51f8\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff1a1) \u63a8\u5bfc\u4ea4\u66ff\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d-\u4e0a\u5347\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u754c\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0b\uff0c\u9690\u85cf\u51f8\u51f9\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u53cc\u8fb9Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u53cc\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u975e\u51f8\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u80fd\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u85cf\u51f8\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u53cc\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u975e\u51f8\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Over-the-air computation shows promising potential for enhancing resource efficiency and scalability in such scenarios by leveraging the superposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the use of uncoded transmission with linear mapping, it also suffers from security vulnerabilities that must be dealt with to allow widespread adoption. In this work, we consider a scenario where multiple cooperating eavesdroppers attempt to infer information about the aggregation result. We derive the optimal joint estimator for the eavesdroppers and provide bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy for both the eavesdroppers and the intended receiver. We show that significant inherent security exists against individual eavesdroppers due to channel misalignment. However, the security level is greatly compromised when the eavesdroppers can cooperate, motivating the need for deliberate security measures. A common measure is to add carefully calibrated perturbation signals (artificial noise) prior to data transmission to improve the security level. To this end, we propose a zero-forced artificial noise design that achieves a high level of security against cooperative eavesdroppers without compromising the aggregation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u7ebf\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u96f6\u8feb\u4eba\u5de5\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u805a\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8fde\u63a5\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u8fb9\u7f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u805a\u5408\u3002\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u53e0\u52a0\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u672a\u7f16\u7801\u4f20\u8f93\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9762\u5bf9\u534f\u4f5c\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u548c\u9884\u671f\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u534f\u4f5c\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u96f6\u8feb\u4eba\u5de5\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u805a\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u7ea7\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4fe1\u9053\u5931\u914d\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u9762\u4e34\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u969c\u788d\u3002\u4f46\u534f\u4f5c\u7a83\u542c\u4f1a\u5927\u5927\u964d\u4f4e\u5b89\u5168\u7ea7\u522b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u96f6\u8feb\u4eba\u5de5\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297\u534f\u4f5c\u7a83\u542c\u8005\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u7ea7\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9762\u5bf9\u534f\u4f5c\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u65f6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u53d6\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5982\u4eba\u5de5\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u96f6\u8feb\u4eba\u5de5\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u805a\u5408\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

Stringent data protection regulations limit access to clinical records for training and integrating machine learning models that have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and personalized care outcomes. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, current generative models either struggle with time-series data or lack formal privacy guaranties. In this paper, we enhance a state-of-the-art time-series generative model to better handle longitudinal clinical data while incorporating quantifiable privacy safeguards. Using real data from chronic kidney disease and ICU patients, we evaluate our method through statistical tests, a Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real (TSTR) setup, and expert clinical review. Our non-private model (Augmented TimeGAN) outperforms transformer- and flow-based models on statistical metrics in several datasets, while our private model (DP-TimeGAN) maintains a mean authenticity of 0.778 on the CKD dataset, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models on the privacy-utility frontier. Both models achieve performance comparable to real data in clinician evaluations, providing robust input data necessary for developing models for complex chronic conditions without compromising data privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7eb5\u5411\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5165\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5728\u6162\u6027\u80be\u75c5\u548cICU\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1", "method": "\u589e\u5f3a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08Augmented TimeGAN\uff09\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff08DP-TimeGAN\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001TSTR\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30", "result": "\u975e\u79c1\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8etransformer\u548cflow-based\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u79c1\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728CKD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u63010.778\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u524d\u6cbf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5f53", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u590d\u6742\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55"}}

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining parameters through strategies such as parameter decomposition, coefficient optimization, and subspace learning, significantly reducing the need for expensive joint training and achieving strong empirical performance across diverse tasks. However, these approaches predominantly treat merging as a problem of parameter space decomposition or fusion coefficient optimization, while overlooking the critical role of directional information in both parameter and feature spaces. In practice, na\u00efve merging introduces inconsistencies in dominant parameter directions and disrupts structural coherence across models, which can degrade performance. Moreover, coefficient-based optimization methods implicitly assume compatible feature-space directions across models. However, Neural Collapse indicates that class features follow structured directional patterns, which may differ across independently trained models, making coefficient optimization alone insufficient. In this work, we emphasize the importance of \\emph{directional alignment} and introduce a unified geometric framework, \\emph{Merging with Directional Alignment} (\\method{}), which aligns directional structures consistently in both the parameter and feature spaces. Our analysis shows that directional alignment improves structural coherence, and extensive experiments across benchmarks, model scales, and task configurations further validate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u6216\u878d\u5408\u7cfb\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6734\u7d20\u5408\u5e76\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e3b\u5bfc\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u5411\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9690\u542b\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u5411\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u795e\u7ecf\u574d\u7f29\u73b0\u8c61\u8868\u660e\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5411\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u5408\u5e76\uff08Merging with Directional Alignment\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Specifically, 1-bit samples of the radio-frequency signal are exchanged over the fronthaul. We investigate via both measurements and simulations based on an accurate model of the testbed hardware, the capability of the proposed architecture to provide uniform quality of services over the coverage area--one of the promises of D-MIMO. Our results are encouraging: for the case in which two user equipments (UEs) communicate over the same 75MHz signal bandwidth, the measured error-vector magnitude meets the 3GPP New Radio specification of 12.5\\% for 16QAM across all tested DMIMO scenarios. We also determine that uplink transmission is a potential bottleneck, due to the limited dynamic range of the automatic gain controller, which prevents the 1-bit quantizer to benefit from dithering.

However, a fundamental trade-off persists between optimization granularity and training stability. While GSPO improves robustness via sequence-level optimization, its monolithic treatment of sequences introduces severe inefficiencies: its conservative clipping mechanism indiscriminately discards valid training samples-a phenomenon we term gradient underutilization-and its uniform credit assignment fails to capture the heterogeneous contributions of critical reasoning steps. In this work, we propose Entropy Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ESPO), a novel framework that reconciles fine-grained control with training stability. ESPO decomposes sequences into groups based on predictive entropy, enabling (1) Entropy-driven Importance Sampling to capture intra-sequence heterogeneity, and (2) Entropy-adaptive Clipping to dynamically allocate trust regions based on model uncertainty. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ESPO not only accelerates convergence but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably improving accuracy on the challenging HMMT benchmark from 4.4% to 13.13%.", "AI": {"tldr": "ESPO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u88c1\u526a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982GRPO\u548cGSPO\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6743\u8861\u3002GSPO\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u673a\u5236\u4f1a\u4e0d\u52a0\u533a\u5206\u5730\u4e22\u5f03\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff08\u68af\u5ea6\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u71b5\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08ESPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u5c06\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ec4\uff1b2\uff09\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u6355\u6349\u5e8f\u5217\u5185\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u71b5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u88c1\u526a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cESPO\u4e0d\u4ec5\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684HMMT\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece4.4%\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u523013.13%\u3002", "conclusion": "ESPO\u6210\u529f\u8c03\u548c\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We compare magnitude thresholding to three 1D CNNs for time-series analysis: a literature baseline (separable convolutions) and two ultra-light models - one purely separable and one with residual connections. Using the BioStampRC21 dataset, 2 s windows at 30 Hz, and subject-independent leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on 16 PwPD with chest-worn IMUs, our residual separable model (Model 2, 533 params) attains PR-AUC = 94.5%, F1 = 91.2%, MCC = 89.4%, matching or surpassing the baseline (5,552 params; PR-AUC = 93.7%, F1 = 90.5%, MCC = 88.5%) with approximately 10x fewer parameters. The smallest model (Model 1, 305 params) reaches PR-AUC = 94.0%, F1 = 91.0%, MCC = 89.1%. Thresholding obtains high recall (89.0%) but low precision (76.5%), yielding many false positives and high inter-subject variance. Sensor-position analysis (train-on-all) shows chest and thighs are most reliable; forearms degrade precision/recall due to non-gait arm motion; naive fusion of all sites does not outperform the best single site. Both compact CNNs execute within tight memory/latency budgets on STM32-class MCUs (sub-10 ms on low-power boards), enabling on-sensor gating of transmission/storage.

Yu"], "title": "Hyperbolic Continuous Structural Entropy for Hierarchical Clustering", "comment": "14 pages, accepted by AAAI 2026", "summary": "Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental machine-learning technique for grouping data points into dendrograms. However, existing hierarchical clustering methods encounter two primary challenges: 1) Most methods specify dendrograms without a global objective. 2) Graph-based methods often neglect the significance of graph structure, optimizing objectives on complete or static predefined graphs. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Continuous Structural Entropy neural networks, namely HypCSE, for structure-enhanced continuous hierarchical clustering. Our key idea is to map data points in the hyperbolic space and minimize the relaxed continuous structural entropy (SE) on structure-enhanced graphs. Specifically, we encode graph vertices in hyperbolic space using hyperbolic graph neural networks and minimize approximate SE defined on graph embeddings. To make the SE objective differentiable for optimization, we reformulate it into a function using the lowest common ancestor (LCA) on trees and then relax it into continuous SE (CSE) by the analogy of hyperbolic graph embeddings and partitioning trees. To ensure a graph structure that effectively captures the hierarchy of data points for CSE calculation, we employ a graph structure learning (GSL) strategy that updates the graph structure during training. Extensive experiments on seven datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HypCSE.", "AI": {"tldr": "HypCSE\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8fde\u7eed\u7ed3\u6784\u71b5\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u805a\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u5927\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u6ca1\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u56fe\u6216\u9759\u6001\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u56fe\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u6570\u636e\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6620\u5c04\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff1b2\uff09\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u8fde\u7eed\u7ed3\u6784\u71b5\uff1b3\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u66f2\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7f16\u7801\u56fe\u9876\u70b9\uff1b4\uff09\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u71b5\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6811\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u516c\u5171\u7956\u5148\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u66f2\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u5212\u5206\u6811\u7684\u7c7b\u6bd4\u5c06\u5176\u677e\u5f1b\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u7ed3\u6784\u71b5\uff1b5\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u66f4\u65b0\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHypCSE\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "HypCSE\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u7ed3\u6784\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

To address these gaps, we propose \\textit{SelfAI}, a general multi-agent platform that combines a User Agent for translating high-level research objectives into standardized experimental configurations, a Cognitive Agent powered by LLMs with optimal stopping criteria to iteratively refine hyperparameter searches, and an Experiment Manager responsible for orchestrating parallel, fault-tolerant training workflows across heterogeneous hardware while maintaining a structured knowledge base for continuous feedback. We further introduce two novel evaluation metrics, Score and $\\text{AUP}_D$, to quantify discovery efficiency and search diversity.

Fast polynomial modular multiplication and fast pointwise multiplication problems are important for cryptosystem applications such as post-quantum cryptography and homomorphic encryption.

In this work, we develop and analyze an efficient dataset distillation algorithm for supervised learning, specifically regression in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, based on matching the losses on the training and synthetic datasets with respect to a fixed set of randomly sampled regressors without any model training. Our first key contribution is a novel performance guarantee proving that our algorithm needs only $\\tilde{O}(d^2)$ sampled regressors to derive a synthetic dataset on which the MSE loss of any bounded linear model is nearly the same as its MSE loss on the given training data. In particular, the model optimized on the synthetic data has close to minimum loss on the training data, thus performing nearly as well as the model optimized on the latter. Complementing this, we also prove a matching lower bound of $\u03a9(d^2)$ for the number of sampled regressors showing the tightness of our analysis.\n  Our second contribution is to extend our algorithm to offline RL dataset distillation by matching the Bellman loss, unlike previous works which used a behavioral cloning objective. This is the first such method which leverages both, the rewards and the next state information, available in offline RL datasets, without any policy model optimization. Our algorithm generates a synthetic dataset whose Bellman loss with respect to any linear action-value predictor is close to the latter's Bellman loss on the offline RL training dataset. Therefore, a policy associated with an action-value predictor optimized on the synthetic dataset performs nearly as well as that derived from the one optimized on the training data.

However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7248\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5e74\u9f84(VAoI)\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u4ee3\u7406\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u8017\u4e3b\u5bfc\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7248\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5e74\u9f84(VAoI)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8bc1\u660e\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u662f\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u5173\u952e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, real-world social networks have several structural inequalities, such as dominant majority groups and underrepresented minority groups. If these inequalities are not considered while designing IM algorithms, the outcomes might be biased, disproportionately benefiting majority groups while marginalizing minorities. In this work, we address this gap by designing a fairness-aware IM method using Reinforcement Learning (RL) that ensures equitable influence outreach across all communities, regardless of protected attributes. Fairness is incorporated using a maximin fairness objective, which prioritizes improving the outreach of the least-influenced group, pushing the solution toward an equitable influence distribution. We propose a novel fairness-aware deep RL method, called DQ4FairIM, that maximizes the expected number of influenced nodes by learning an RL policy. The learnt policy ensures that minority groups formulate the IM problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use deep Q-learning, combined with the Structure2Vec network embedding, earning together with Structure2Vec network embedding to solve the MDP.

To formally address this issue, we study \\emph{list replicability} in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) RL framework, where an algorithm must return a near-optimal policy that lies in a \\emph{small list} of policies across different runs, with high probability. The size of this list defines the \\emph{list complexity}. We introduce both weak and strong forms of list replicability: the weak form ensures that the final learned policy belongs to a small list, while the strong form further requires that the entire sequence of executed policies remains constrained. These objectives are challenging, as existing RL algorithms exhibit exponential list complexity due to their instability. Our main theoretical contribution is a provably efficient tabular RL algorithm that guarantees list replicability by ensuring the list complexity remains polynomial in the number of states, actions, and the horizon length. We further extend our techniques to achieve strong list replicability, bounding the number of possible policy execution traces polynomially with high probability. Our theoretical result is made possible by key innovations including (i) a novel planning strategy that selects actions based on lexicographic order among near-optimal choices within a randomly chosen tolerance threshold, and (ii) a mechanism for testing state reachability in stochastic environments while preserving replicability. Finally, we demonstrate that our theoretical investigation sheds light on resolving the \\emph{instability} issue of RL algorithms used in practice. In particular, we show that empirically, our new planning strategy can be incorporated into practical RL frameworks to enhance their stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5217\u8868\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4fdd\u8bc1\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5217\u8868\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u683cRL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7684\u5217\u8868\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6b63\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728PAC RL\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5217\u8868\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f31\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u5f3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8868\u683cRL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5178\u987a\u5e8f\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5bb9\u5fcd\u9608\u503c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5728\u968f\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8d21\u732e\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5217\u8868\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u6027\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5217\u8868\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u6570\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7ea7\u522b\u3002\u5f3a\u5217\u8868\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u6027\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u91cf\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6709\u754c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u65b0\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u878d\u5165\u5b9e\u9645RL\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5217\u8868\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u76f8\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing fairness methods are predominantly classification-oriented and fail to extend to continuous outputs, making a unified fairness objective difficult to formulate. Further, existing MTL optimization is structurally misaligned with fairness: constraining only the shared representation, allowing task heads to absorb bias and leading to uncontrolled task-specific disparities. Finally, most work treats fairness as a zero-sum trade-off with utility, enforcing symmetric constraints that achieve parity by degrading well-served groups. We introduce FairMT, a unified fairness-aware MTL framework that accommodates all three task types under incomplete supervision. At its core is an Asymmetric Heterogeneous Fairness Constraint Aggregation mechanism, which consolidates task-dependent asymmetric violations into a unified fairness constraint. Utility and fairness are jointly optimized via a primal--dual formulation, while a head-aware multi-objective optimization proxy provides a tractable descent geometry that explicitly accounts for head-induced anisotropy. Across three homogeneous and heterogeneous MTL benchmarks encompassing diverse modalities and supervision regimes, FairMT consistently achieves substantial fairness gains while maintaining superior task utility.

Unlike in the continuous setting-where diffusion models are well understood both theoretically and empirically-the discrete case poses significant challenges due to its combinatorial structure and the lack of rigorous analysis. In this work, we establish convergence guarantees for DDMs on both the finite space $\\mathbb{Z}^d_m=\\{0,...,m-1\\}^d$ and the countably infinite space $\\mathbb{N}^d$ under mild assumptions, focusing on forward masked and random walk dynamics. Similar to the continuous case, the backward process can be characterized by a discrete score function, whose monotonicity plays a central role in deriving the error bounds of the generated data. Notably, the complexity of our model scales linearly up to logarithmic factors, rather than exponentially, with the dimension, making it efficiently scalable to high-dimensional data. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first non-asymptotic convergence guarantees that do not rely on the boundedness of the estimated score-covering not only uniform noising processes on $\\mathbb{Z}^d_m$ and on $\\mathbb{N}^d$, but also masking-based noising dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08DDMs\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u7a7a\u95f4\u2124\u1d50\u1d48\u548c\u53ef\u6570\u65e0\u9650\u7a7a\u95f4\u2115\u1d48\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u968f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u800c\u975e\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u6709\u5145\u5206\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u60c5\u51b5\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u2124\u1d50\u1d48\u548c\u2115\u1d48\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u5411\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u6765\u63a8\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u968f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff08\u81f3\u591a\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bc4\u5206\u6709\u754c\u6027\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u2124\u1d50\u1d48\u548c\u2115\u1d48\u4e0a\u7684\u5747\u5300\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u968f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u800c\u975e\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A key reason is that these models are non-identifiable (singular), violating core assumptions behind PAC bounds and asymptotic normality. Singular learning theory (SLT), a physics-inspired framework grounded in algebraic geometry, has gained popularity for its ability to close this theory-practice gap. In this paper, we empirically study SLT in toy settings relevant to interpretability and phase transitions. First, we understand the SLT free energy $\\mathcal{F}_n$ by testing an Arrhenius-style rate hypothesis using both a grokking modulo-arithmetic model and Anthropic's Toy Models of Superposition. Second, we understand the local learning coefficient $\u03bb_\u03b1$ by measuring how it scales with problem difficulty across several controlled network families (polynomial regressors, low-rank linear networks, and low-rank autoencoders). Our experiments recover known scaling laws while others yield meaningful deviations from theoretical expectations.

While diffusion models have set recent benchmarks, flow matching (FM) offers a promising alternative. This paper presents different ways to implement flow matching for tabular data synthesis. We provide a comprehensive empirical study that compares flow matching (FM and variational FM) with a state-of-the-art diffusion method (TabDDPM and TabSyn) in tabular data synthesis. We evaluate both the standard Optimal Transport (OT) and the Variance Preserving (VP) probability paths, and also compare deterministic and stochastic samplers -- something possible when learning to generate using \\textit{variational} flow matching -- characterising the empirical relationship between data utility and privacy risk. Our key findings reveal that flow matching, particularly TabbyFlow, outperforms diffusion baselines. Flow matching methods also achieves better performance with remarkably low function evaluations ($\\leq$ 100 steps), offering a substantial computational advantage. The choice of probability path is also crucial, as using the OT path demonstrates superior performance, while VP has potential for producing synthetic data with lower disclosure risk. Lastly, our results show that making flows stochastic not only preserves marginal distributions but, in some instances, enables the generation of high utility synthetic data with reduced disclosure risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "TabbyFlow\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff08\u2264100\u6b65\uff09\uff0cOT\u8def\u5f84\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\uff0cVP\u8def\u5f84\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u662f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fd1\u671f\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08FM\u548c\u53d8\u5206FM\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08OT\uff09\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u4fdd\u6301\uff08VP\uff09\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08TabDDPM\u548cTabSyn\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fTabbyFlow\uff09\u4f18\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\uff08\u2264100\u6b65\uff09\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u663e\u8457\uff1bOT\u8def\u5f84\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff0cVP\u8def\u5f84\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4f4e\u62ab\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6d41\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8fb9\u7f18\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fd8\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u62ab\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u662f\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper aims at addressing this issue by improving the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), a state-of-the-art glassbox model that delivers both high accuracy and complete transparency. The paper outlines three distinct enhancement methodologies: targeted hyperparameter optimization with Bayesian methods, the implementation of a custom multi-objective function for fairness for hyperparameter optimization, and a novel self-supervised pre-training pipeline for cold-start scenarios. All three methodologies are evaluated across standard benchmark datasets, including the Adult Income, Credit Card Fraud Detection, and UCI Heart Disease datasets. The analysis indicates that while the tuning process yielded marginal improvements in the primary ROC AUC metric, it led to a subtle but important shift in the model's decision-making behavior, demonstrating the value of a multi-faceted evaluation beyond a single performance score.

They additionally suffer from optimization instabilities and are unable to dynamically adapt their inference scheme in the presence of noisy PDE residuals. To address these limitations, we introduce PRISMA (PDE Residual Informed Spectral Modulation with Attention), a conditional diffusion neural operator that embeds PDE residuals directly into the model's architecture via attention mechanisms in the spectral domain, enabling gradient-descent free inference. In contrast to previous methods that use PDE loss solely as external optimization targets, PRISMA integrates PDE residuals as integral architectural features, making it inherently fast, robust, accurate, and free from sensitive hyperparameter tuning. We show that PRISMA has competitive accuracy, at substantially lower inference costs, compared to previous methods across five benchmark PDEs, especially with noisy observations, while using 10x to 100x fewer denoising steps, leading to 15x to 250x faster inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRISMA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u57df\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c06PDE\u6b8b\u5dee\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684PDE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\uff1a1) \u4f9d\u8d56\u7f13\u6162\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\uff1b2) \u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b3) \u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0PDE\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e0b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPRISMA\uff08PDE\u6b8b\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u8c31\u8c03\u5236\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u8c31\u57df\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c06PDE\u6b8b\u5dee\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u654f\u611f\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6PDE\u4e0a\uff0cPRISMA\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f7f\u752810-100\u500d\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b015-250\u500d\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISMA\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06PDE\u6b8b\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u975e\u5916\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u654f\u611f\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u7684PDE\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

The burden falls disproportionately on marginalized populations and the Global South, where under-resourced health systems, exposure to urban heat islands, and the lack of adaptive infrastructure amplify risks. Yet current numerical weather prediction models often fail to capture micro-scale extremes, leaving the most vulnerable excluded from timely early warnings. We present a Graph Neural Network framework for localized, high-resolution temperature forecasting. By leveraging spatial learning and efficient computation, our approach generates forecasts at multiple horizons, up to 48 hours. For Southwestern Ontario, Canada, the model captures temperature patterns with a mean MAE of 1.93$^{\\circ}$C across 1-48h forecasts and MAE@48h of 2.93$^{\\circ}$C, evaluated using 24h input windows on the largest region.

Recent work showed that under square loss, flat solutions (motivated by flat / stable minima and Edge of Stability phenomenon) provably cannot overfit, but it remains unclear whether the same phenomenon holds for logistic loss. This is a puzzling open problem because existing work on logistic loss shows that gradient descent with increasing step size converges to interpolating solutions (at infinity, for the margin-separable cases). In this paper, we prove that the \\emph{flatness implied generalization} is more delicate under logistic loss. On the positive side, we show that flat solutions enjoy near-optimal generalization bounds within a region between the left-most and right-most \\emph{uncertain} sets determined by each candidate solution. On the negative side, we show that there exist arbitrarily flat yet overfitting solutions at infinity that are (falsely) certain everywhere, thus certifying that flatness alone is insufficient for generalization in general.

Each MDT defines a trajectory-dependent diffusion operator with a clear probabilistic and geometric interpretation, capturing over time the interplay between data views. Our formulation encompasses existing multi-view diffusion models, while providing new degrees of freedom for view interaction and fusion. We establish theoretical properties under mild assumptions, including ergodicity of both the point-wise operator and the process in itself. We also derive MDT-based diffusion distances, and associated embeddings via singular value decompositions. Finally, we propose various strategies for learning MDT operators within the defined operator space, guided by internal quality measures. Beyond enabling flexible model design, MDTs also offer a neutral baseline for evaluating diffusion-based approaches through comparison with randomly selected MDTs. Experiments show the practical impact of the MDT operators in a manifold learning and data clustering context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u7ec7\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u4ea4\u4e92\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\uff08MDTs\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u7b97\u5b50\u6784\u5efa\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6269\u6563\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfcMDT-based\u6269\u6563\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86MDT\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u904d\u5386\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60MDT\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6570\u636e\u805a\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86MDT\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "MDT\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e2d\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Another is that there are clear axes of difficulty--e.g., more complex geometries and higher Reynolds numbers--along which problems become (1) harder for classical solvers and thus (2) more likely to benefit from neural speedups. Towards addressing this chicken-and-egg challenge, we study difficulty transfer on 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes, systematically varying task complexity along geometry (number and placement of obstacles), physics (Reynolds number), and their combination. Similar to how it is possible to spend compute to pre-train foundation models and improve their performance on downstream tasks, we find that by classically solving (analogously pre-generating) many low and medium difficulty examples and including them in the training set, it is possible to learn high-difficulty physics from far fewer samples. Furthermore, we show that by combining low and high difficulty data, we can spend 8.9x less compute on pre-generating a dataset to achieve the same error as using only high difficulty examples. Our results highlight that how we allocate classical-solver compute across difficulty levels is as important as how much we allocate overall, and suggest substantial gains from principled curation of pre-generated PDE data for neural solvers.

Distribution shifts, emerging vulnerabilities, and evolving requirements demand continuous updates to machine learning models. Yet even benign parameter updates can have unintended consequences, such as catastrophic forgetting in classical models or alignment drift in foundation models. Existing heuristic approaches (e.g., regularization, parameter isolation) can mitigate these effects but cannot certify that updated models continue to satisfy required performance specifications. We address this problem by introducing a framework for provably safe model updates. Our approach first formalizes the problem as computing the largest locally invariant domain (LID): a connected region in parameter space where all points are certified to satisfy a given specification. While exact maximal LID computation is intractable, we show that relaxing the problem to parameterized abstract domains (orthotopes, zonotopes) yields a tractable primal-dual formulation.

By applying the policy gradient theorem to this objective, we derive a modified surrogate objective for MaxEntRL that incorporates diffusion dynamics in a principled way.

While pharmaceutical R&D is plagued by high attrition rates and enormous costs, particularly within neuroscience, where success rates are below 10%, timely identification of promising programs can streamline resource allocation and reduce financial risk. Leveraging data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database and success labels from the recently developed Clinical Trial Outcome dataset, the classifier extracts text-based clinical trial features using statistical NLP techniques. These features were integrated into several non-LLM frameworks (logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest) to generate calibrated probability scores. Model performance was assessed on a retrospective dataset of 101,145 completed clinical trials spanning 1976-2024, achieving an overall ROC-AUC of 0.64. An LLM-based predictive model was then built using BioBERT, a domain-specific language representation encoder. The BioBERT-based model achieved an overall ROC-AUC of 0.74 and a Brier Score of 0.185, indicating its predictions had, on average, 40% less squared error than would be observed using industry benchmarks. The BioBERT-based model also made trial outcome predictions that were superior to benchmark values 70% of the time overall.

Many existing fairness approaches rely on coarse demographic adjustments or post-hoc corrections, which fail to capture the latent structure of clinical populations and may unintentionally reinforce bias. We propose FAIR-MTL, a fairness-aware multitask learning framework designed to provide equitable and fine-grained prediction of postoperative complication severity.\n  Instead of relying on explicit sensitive attributes during model training, FAIR-MTL employs a data-driven subgroup inference mechanism. We extract a compact demographic embedding, and apply k-means clustering to uncover latent patient subgroups that may be differentially affected by traditional models. These inferred subgroup labels determine task routing within a shared multitask architecture. During training, subgroup imbalance is mitigated through inverse-frequency weighting, and regularization prevents overfitting to smaller groups.\n  Applied to postoperative complication prediction with four severity levels, FAIR-MTL achieves an AUC of 0.86 and an accuracy of 75%, outperforming single-task baselines while substantially reducing bias. For gender, the demographic parity difference decreases to 0.055 and equalized odds to 0.094; for age, these values reduce to 0.056 and 0.148, respectively. Model interpretability is ensured through SHAP and Gini importance analyses, which consistently highlight clinically meaningful predictors such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, and patient weight.

This paper sheds a new light on the matroid semi-bandit problem by exploiting its underlying unimodal structure. We demonstrate that, with negligible loss in regret, the number of iterations involving the membership oracle can be limited to \\mathcal{O}(\\log \\log T)$.

The proposed framework provides insights into the relationship between biological memory processes and artificial learning systems, opening new avenues for neuroscience-inspired AI research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u751f\u6210\u56de\u653e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u7269\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5de9\u56fa\u673a\u5236\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534715.3%", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5de9\u56fa\u673a\u5236\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\u539f\u7406\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u751f\u6210\u56de\u653e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u751f\u6210\u56de\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u7387", "result": "\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\u56de\u653e\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534715.3%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u5219\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684AI\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84"}}

In this paper, we assess the performance of the large language model Qwen3-8B on both tasks. Qwen3-8B is a state-of-the-art model that exhibits strong instruction-following and multilingual capabilities, and is distinct from standard models, primarily because it is specifically optimized for efficient fine tuning and high performance on reasoning-based benchmarks, making it suitable for financial applications. To adapt this model, we apply Noisy Embedding Instruction Finetuning and based on our previous work, this method increases robustness by injecting controlled noise into the embedding layers during supervised adaptation. We improve efficiency further with Rank-stabilized Low-Rank Adaptation low-rank optimization approach, and FlashAttention, which allow for faster training with lower GPU memory. For both tasks, we benchmark Qwen3-8B against standard classical transformer models, such as T5, BERT, and RoBERTa, and large models at scale, such as LLaMA1-7B, LLaMA2-7B, and Baichuan2-7B. The findings reveal that Qwen3-8B consistently surpasses these baselines by obtaining better classification accuracy and needing fewer training epochs. The synergy of instruction-based fine-tuning and memory-efficient optimization methods suggests Qwen3-8B can potentially serve as a scalable, economical option for real-time financial NLP applications.

These agents must orchestrate complex sequences of data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization, tasks that require sophisticated planning and iteration. While recent work on building ML agents has explored using large language models (LLMs) for direct code generation, tool-augmented approaches offer greater modularity and reliability. However, existing tool-use benchmarks focus primarily on task-specific tool selection or argument extraction for tool invocation, failing to evaluate the sophisticated planning capabilities required for ML Agents. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented ML agents using a curated set of 61 specialized tools and 15 tabular ML challenges from Kaggle. Our benchmark goes beyond traditional tool-use evaluation by incorporating an in-memory named object management, allowing agents to flexibly name, save, and retrieve intermediate results throughout the workflows. We demonstrate that standard ReAct-style approaches struggle to generate valid tool sequences for complex ML pipelines, and that tree search methods with LLM-based evaluation underperform due to inconsistent state scoring. To address these limitations, we propose two simple approaches: 1) using shaped deterministic rewards with structured textual feedback, and 2) decomposing the original problem into a sequence of sub-tasks, which significantly improves trajectory validity and task performance. Using GPT-4o, our approach improves over ReAct by 16.52 percentile positions, taking the median across all Kaggle challenges.

However, current models overfit to existing oversimplified datasets that does not represent naturally occurring and biologically relevant proteins with modifications. In this work, we curate a complete and modification-aware version of the widely used DAVIS dataset by incorporating 4,032 kinase-ligand pairs involving substitutions, insertions, deletions, and phosphorylation events. This enriched dataset enables benchmarking of predictive models under biologically realistic conditions. Based on this new dataset, we propose three benchmark settings-Augmented Dataset Prediction, Wild-Type to Modification Generalization, and Few-Shot Modification Generalization-designed to assess model robustness in the presence of protein modifications. Through extensive evaluation of both docking-free and docking-based methods, we find that docking-based model generalize better in zero-shot settings. In contrast, docking-free models tend to overfit to wild-type proteins and struggle with unseen modifications but show notable improvement when fine-tuned on a small set of modified examples. We anticipate that the curated dataset and benchmarks offer a valuable foundation for developing models that better generalize to protein modifications, ultimately advancing precision medicine in drug discovery.

We demonstrate that pre-trained tabular models encoding these primitives enable reliable optimization without per-circuit engineering.

It is a common type of out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, frequently encountered in real-world graph data with complex structures. Existing research has revealed that most out-of-the-box graph neural networks (GNNs) fail to account for covariate shifts. Furthermore, we observe that existing methods aimed at addressing covariate shifts often fail to fully leverage the rich information contained within the latent space. Motivated by the potential of the latent space, we introduce a new method called MPAIACL for More Powerful Adversarial Invariant Augmentation using Contrastive Learning.

However, conventional reward models are prone to reward hacking or over-optimization, where the policy exploits shortcut patterns to obtain high reward scores that do not reflect true human preference. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based reward models can enhance discriminative capability, they typically introduce substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an upcycle and merge MoE reward modeling approach. We first upcycle a dense reward model into a MoE architecture, where a shared expert captures general knowledge, while normal experts specialize in instruction-specific patterns. We then apply routing-weight normalization and merge experts back into a dense model through a learnable weight-averaging mechanism, preserving performance gains while significantly reducing inference cost. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates reward hacking across various model scales. Our work highlights the potential of upcycle and merge MoE structures for improving both robustness and efficiency of RLHF reward models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\"\u5347\u7ea7\u5408\u5e76\"\u7684MoE\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7a20\u5bc6\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5347\u7ea7\u4e3aMoE\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u518d\u5408\u5e76\u56de\u7a20\u5bc6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u5229\u7528\u6377\u5f84\u6a21\u5f0f\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u6570\u5e76\u4e0d\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u3002\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u4e8eMoE\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u5e26\u6765\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u5347\u7ea7\u5408\u5e76\"MoE\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5c06\u7a20\u5bc6\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5347\u7ea7\u4e3aMoE\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5171\u4eab\u4e13\u5bb6\u6355\u83b7\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u666e\u901a\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2) \u5e94\u7528\u8def\u7531\u6743\u91cd\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5e73\u5747\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u4e13\u5bb6\u5408\u5e76\u56de\u7a20\u5bc6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5347\u7ea7\u5408\u5e76MoE\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8RLHF\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This limitation arises from their assumption of a fixed underlying data distribution, which may fail to meet user needs and provide unsatisfactory clustering outcomes. Our work investigates how multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can be leveraged to achieve user-driven clustering, emphasizing their adaptability to user-specified semantic requirements. However, directly using MLLM output for clustering has risks for producing unstructured and generic image descriptions instead of feature-specific and concrete ones. To address these issues, our method first discovers that MLLMs' hidden states of text tokens are strongly related to the corresponding features, and leverages these embeddings to perform clusterings from any user-defined criteria.

Synthetic power generation data modeled on atmospheric conditions provide another avenue for improving the robustness of data-driven dispatch strategies. To these ends, the present work develops two deep learning frameworks: COVE-NN, an LSTM-based dispatch strategy tailored to individual wind farms, which reduced annual COVE by 32.3% over 43 years of simulated operations in a case study at the Pyron site; and a power generation modeling framework that reduced RMSE by 9.5% and improved power curve similarity by 18.9% when validated on the Palouse wind farm.

We argue that multimodal large language models (MLLMs), despite extensive video training, lack this fundamental spatial reasoning capability, a critical limitation for embodied applications. To demonstrate these limitations and drive research, we introduce REM (Reasoning over Embodied Multi-Frame Trajectories), a benchmark using controllable 3D environments for long-horizon embodied spatial reasoning. REM systematically evaluates key aspects like object permanence/distinction, spatial relationships, and numerical tracking across dynamic embodied viewpoints. Our evaluation shows that the best-performing current models exhibit promising overall performance, but become increasingly unreliable at even moderate complexity levels easily handled by humans.

We develop specialized neural network architectures and loss functions that enable the filter to actively learn contraction conditions satisfying Assumption 2.3 in exponential family distributions, thereby ensuring practical application of our theoretical results.

In this study, we present a hybrid modelling framework that integrates policy-aware fertility functions into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) enhanced with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture physical constraints and temporal dependencies in population dynamics. The model is applied to India's age structured population from 2024 to 2054 under three fertility-policy scenarios: continuation of current fertility decline, stricter population control, and relaxed fertility promotion. The governing transport-reaction partial differential equation is formulated with India-specific demographic indicators, including age-specific fertility and mortality rates. PINNs embed the core population equation and policy-driven fertility changes, while LSTM layers improve long-term forecasting across decades. Results show that fertility policies substantially shape future age distribution, dependency ratios, and workforce size.

Chatbots have been used in healthcare to provide clinical support and enhance the user experience, making it possible to provide meaningful clinical patterns from text-based data through chatbots. The proposed research utilises several different natural language processing methods to study the occurrences of symptom descriptions in medicine as well as analyse the patterns that emerge through these conversations within medical bots. Through the use of the Medical Conversations to Disease Dataset which contains 960 multi-turn dialogues divided into 24 Clinical Conditions, a standardised representation of conversations between patient and bot is created for further analysis by computational means. The multi-method approach uses a variety of tools, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify latent symptom themes, K-Means to group symptom descriptions by similarity, Transformer-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract medical concepts, and the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent symptom pairs. Findings from the analysis indicate a coherent structure of clinically relevant topics, moderate levels of clustering cohesiveness and several high confidence rates on the relationships between symptoms like fever headache and rash itchiness. The results support the notion that conversational medical data can be a valuable diagnostic signal for early symptom interpretation, assist in strengthening decision support and improve how users interact with tele-health technology.

To address this issue, we propose a framework to automatically optimize these parameters using an AI agent based on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, i.e., Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The SKA Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset is utilized to assess the feasibility and reliability of this framework. The AI agent interacts with the environment by adjusting parameters based on the feedback from the SDC2 score defined by the SDC2 Team, progressively learning to select parameter sets that yield improved performance. After sufficient training, the AI agent can automatically identify an optimal parameter configuration that outperform the benchmark set by Team SoFiA within only 100 evaluation steps and with reduced time consumption. Our approach could address similar problems requiring complex parameter tuning, beyond radio band surveys and source extraction. Yet, high-quality training sets containing representative observations and catalogs of ground truth are essential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60AI\u4ee3\u7406\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u5c04\u7535\u5929\u6587\u6e90\u63d0\u53d6\u8f6f\u4ef6SoFiA\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728SKA\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5c04\u7535\u5de1\u5929\uff08\u5982SKA\uff09\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6e90\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982SoFiA\u3001Aegean\uff09\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5316\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5Soft Actor-Critic\uff08SAC\uff09\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528SDC2\u8bc4\u5206\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e", "result": "AI\u4ee3\u7406\u4ec5\u9700100\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b65\u9aa4\u5373\u53ef\u627e\u5230\u4f18\u4e8eTeam SoFiA\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u6d88\u8017\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5305\u542b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u661f\u8868\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5c04\u7535\u5de1\u5929\u548c\u6e90\u63d0\u53d6\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u95ee\u9898"}}

A common belief is that DPO is supervised learning while PPO is reinforcement learning, yet deeper analyses for the reasons underlying these differences remain lacking. To fill this gap, we analyze their optimization dynamics, revealing distinct algorithmic behaviors and comprehending their underlying causes. First, we examine the target directions of gradient-based updates and find that DPO follows stable targets, whereas PPO follows dynamic targets that balance exploration and exploitation, thus validating the common belief from a new perspective. Second, we examine the roles of positive learning, negative learning, and loss reweighting, which are three key components in PO methods. Our analyses reveal that these components play fairly different roles. In DPO, positive and negative learning jointly shape the learning targets meanwhile mutually offset each other. However, loss reweighting in DPO acts less as a reward signal but more as a regularizer to mitigate overfitting. In PPO, negative learning primarily supports exploration rather than determining the targets. Meanwhile, loss reweighting, related to absolute values of token-level advantages, indicates the distinct roles of token groups in updating targets. Given these findings, we conduct carefully designed ablation studies to further examine how controlling these dynamics impacts optimization efficiency and practical performance. The insights gained from our analyses not only deepen the understanding of PO methods but also inspire the development of more preference-aligned LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790DPO\u548cPPO\u4e24\u79cd\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u6b63\u8d1f\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u635f\u5931\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1DPO\u548cPPO\u5728LLM\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u4e3aDPO\u662f\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u800cPPO\u662f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u539f\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5206\u6790\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83DPO\u548cPPO\uff1a1\uff09\u68c0\u67e5\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u5411\uff1b2\uff09\u5206\u6790\u6b63\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8d1f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u635f\u5931\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b3\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0DPO\u9075\u5faa\u7a33\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u800cPPO\u9075\u5faa\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\uff1bDPO\u4e2d\u6b63\u8d1f\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u540c\u5851\u9020\u76ee\u6807\u4f46\u76f8\u4e92\u62b5\u6d88\uff0c\u635f\u5931\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u66f4\u591a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff1bPPO\u4e2d\u8d1f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u8981\u652f\u6301\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u635f\u5931\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u4e0etoken\u7ea7\u4f18\u52bf\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

The training process involved repeated optimizations of data preprocessing, LoRA fine-tuning, and the inference-stage adapter. The experiment employed offline closed-loop replay, comparing Sigma with the untuned pure pi05_base_base model under data conditions. Results showed that Sigma exhibited a stable decrease in control MSE across vector, fragment, and entire trajectory timescales, while maintaining the telepathy norm and semantic-text alignment quality unchanged.

We introduce a framework for estimating a model's intrinsic dimensionality by treating learned representations as projections onto a low-rank subspace of the model's full capacity. Our approach: train a full-rank teacher, factorize its weights at multiple ranks, and train each factorized student via distillation to measure performance as a function of rank.\n  We define effective rank as a region, not a point: the smallest contiguous set of ranks for which the student reaches 85-95% of teacher accuracy. To stabilize estimates, we fit accuracy vs. rank with a monotone PCHIP interpolant and identify crossings of the normalized curve.

Current QD methods commonly maintain diversity by dividing the behavior space into discrete regions, ensuring that solutions are distributed across different parts of the space. The QD problem is then solved by searching for the best solution in each region. This approach to QD optimization poses challenges in large solution spaces, where storing many solutions is impractical, and in high-dimensional behavior spaces, where discretization becomes ineffective due to the curse of dimensionality. We present an alternative framing of the QD problem, called \\emph{Soft QD}, that sidesteps the need for discretizations. We validate this formulation by demonstrating its desirable properties, such as monotonicity, and by relating its limiting behavior to the widely used QD Score metric.

However, their underlying reasoning \"algorithms\" remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we propose ReJump, which represents a reasoning trace as a visitation order over nodes in a tree of intermediate problem-solving steps. Transitions between nodes, which we term jumps, include adjacent moves that capture behaviors such as calculation, and non-adjacent moves that capture behaviors such as backtracking and verification. ReJump enables analyzing LLM reasoning with diverse metrics that quantify exploration, exploitation, overthinking, forgetting, and verification. Using our proposed LLM agent to extract reasoning traces into ReJump format, we evaluate state-of-the-art LRMs on two tasks and find that models with similar accuracy can exhibit distinct reasoning behaviors, while different tasks favor different reasoning styles (e.g., varying balance between exploration and exploitation). To further understand how learning strategies shape reasoning, we use ReJump to compare distilled LRMs with their teachers, CoT-prompted LLMs with LRMs, and to examine how the number of reasoning examples and reinforcement learning affect reasoning behavior. Finally, we show that ReJump can improve reasoning quality at test time through strategies such as ReJump-guided Best-of-N selection and prompt selection.

We propose KTA v2, a prediction-space knowledge trading market for FL. Each round, clients locally train on their private data, then share only logits on a small public reference set. The server constructs a client-client similarity graph in prediction space, combines it with reference-set accuracy to form per-client teacher ensembles, and sends back personalized soft targets for a second-stage distillation update. This two-stage procedure can be interpreted as approximate block-coordinate descent on a unified objective with prediction-space regularization. Experiments on FEMNIST, CIFAR-10 and AG News show that, under comparable or much lower communication budgets, KTA v2 consistently outperforms a local-only baseline and strong parameter-based methods (FedAvg, FedProx), and substantially improves over a FedMD-style global teacher. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, KTA v2 reaches 57.7% test accuracy using approximately 1/1100 of FedAvg's communication, while on AG News it attains 89.3% accuracy with approximately 1/300 of FedAvg's traffic.", "AI": {"tldr": "KTA v2\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea4\u6613\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u5c0f\u516c\u5171\u53c2\u8003\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684logits\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982FedAvg\uff09\u4f20\u8f93\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u53d1\u6563\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKTA v2\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea4\u6613\u5e02\u573a\uff1a1\uff09\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5728\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ec5\u5171\u4eab\u5c0f\u516c\u5171\u53c2\u8003\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684logits\uff1b2\uff09\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u8003\u96c6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5f62\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6559\u5e08\u96c6\u6210\uff1b3\uff09\u53d1\u9001\u8f6f\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u84b8\u998f\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "result": "\u5728FEMNIST\u3001CIFAR-10\u548cAG News\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0cKTA v2\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08FedAvg\u3001FedProx\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8aFedMD\u5f0f\u5168\u5c40\u6559\u5e08\u3002\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528ResNet-18\u8fbe\u523057.7%\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u7ea6\u4e3aFedAvg\u76841/1100\uff1b\u5728AG News\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523089.3%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u7ea6\u4e3aFedAvg\u76841/300\u3002", "conclusion": "KTA v2\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea4\u6613\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing one-shot methods rely on unstable pairwise centroid distances or neighborhood rankings, degrading severely under strong LDP noise and data heterogeneity. We present Gravitational Federated Clustering (GFC), a novel approach to privacy-preserving federated clustering that overcomes the limitations of distance-based methods under varying LDP. Addressing the critical challenge of clustering non-IID data with diverse privacy guarantees, GFC transforms privatized client centroids into a global gravitational potential field where true cluster centers emerge as topologically persistent singularities. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a client-side compactness-aware perturbation mechanism that encodes local cluster geometry as \"mass\" values, and (2) a server-side topological aggregation phase that extracts stable centroids through persistent homology analysis of the potential field's superlevel sets. Theoretically, we establish a closed-form bound between the privacy budget $\u03b5$ and centroid estimation error, proving the potential field's Lipschitz smoothing properties exponentially suppress noise in high-density regions. Empirically, GFC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ten benchmarks, especially under strong LDP constraints ($\u03b5< 1$), while maintaining comparable performance at lower privacy budgets. By reformulating federated clustering as a topological persistence problem in a synthetic physics-inspired space, GFC achieves unprecedented privacy-accuracy trade-offs without iterative communication, providing a new perspective for privacy-preserving distributed learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "GFC\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f15\u529b\u52bf\u573a\u62d3\u6251\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5f3aLDP\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fed\u4ee3\u901a\u4fe1\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u5728\u672c\u5730\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u73b0\u6709\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u8d28\u5fc3\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u90bb\u57df\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5728\u5f3aLDP\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "GFC\u5c06\u79c1\u6709\u5316\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8d28\u5fc3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u5f15\u529b\u52bf\u573a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u63d0\u53d6\u771f\u5b9e\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a(1) \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7d27\u51d1\u611f\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u805a\u7c7b\u51e0\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\"\u8d28\u91cf\"\u503c\uff1b(2) \u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u62d3\u6251\u805a\u5408\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52bf\u573a\u8d85\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u7a33\u5b9a\u8d28\u5fc3\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u03b5\u4e0e\u8d28\u5fc3\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u52bf\u573a\u7684Lipschitz\u5e73\u6ed1\u7279\u6027\u5728\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u6307\u6570\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f3aLDP\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b(\u03b5<1)\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0cGFC\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fed\u4ee3\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Existing deep traffic models are typically trained per city and backbone, creating high maintenance cost and poor transfer to data-scarce cities. We ask whether a single, backbone-agnostic layer can condition on \"which city this sequence comes from\", improve accuracy in full- and low-data regimes, and support better cross-city adaptation with minimal code changes.\n  We propose CityCond, a light-weight city-conditioned memory layer that augments existing spatio-temporal backbones. CityCond combines a city-ID encoder with an optional shared memory bank (CityMem). Given a city index and backbone hidden states, it produces city-conditioned features fused through gated residual connections. We attach CityCond to five representative backbones (GRU, TCN, Transformer, GNN, STGCN) and evaluate three regimes: full-data, low-data, and cross-city few-shot transfer on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. We also run auxiliary experiments on SIND, a drone-based multi-agent trajectory dataset from a signalized intersection in Tianjin (we focus on pedestrian tracks).\n  Across more than fourteen model variants and three random seeds, CityCond yields consistent improvements, with the largest gains for high-capacity backbones such as Transformers and STGCNs. CityMem reduces Transformer error by roughly one third in full-data settings and brings substantial gains in low-data and cross-city transfer. On SIND, simple city-ID conditioning modestly improves low-data LSTM performance. CityCond can therefore serve as a reusable design pattern for scalable, multi-city forecasting under realistic data constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "CityCond\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u57ce\u5e02\u6761\u4ef6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5c42\uff0c\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57ce\u5e02\u95f4\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u65b0\u57ce\u5e02\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCityCond\u5c42\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u57ce\u5e02ID\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u53ef\u9009\u5171\u4eab\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93(CityMem)\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u5c06\u57ce\u5e02\u6761\u4ef6\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u7a7a\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u9aa8\u5e72\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728METR-LA\u3001PEMS-BAY\u548cSIND\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCityCond\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e09\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5bf9Transformer\u548cSTGCN\u7b49\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u9aa8\u5e72\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "CityCond\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u57ce\u5e02\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper tackles this challenge using the volatile REFIT household dataset, which is complicated by a large structural data gap. We first address this by conducting a rigorous comparative experiment to select a Seasonal Imputation method, demonstrating its superiority over linear interpolation in preserving the data's underlying distribution. We then systematically evaluate a hierarchy of models, progressing from classical baselines (SARIMA, Prophet) to machine learning (XGBoost) and advanced deep learning architectures (LSTM). Our findings reveal that classical models fail to capture the data's non-linear, regime-switching behavior. While the LSTM provided the most well-calibrated probabilistic forecast, the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) emerged as the superior all-round model, achieving the best point forecast accuracy (RMSE 481.94) and producing safer, more cautious prediction intervals that effectively capture extreme volatility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9REFIT\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u7535\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0TFT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46REFIT\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u7535\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u5236\u5ea6\u8f6c\u6362\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9009\u62e9\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u53e3\uff1b2) \u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b(SARIMA\u3001Prophet)\u5230\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60(XGBoost)\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60(LSTM\u3001TFT)\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff1bLSTM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff1bTFT\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f4e\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee(RMSE 481.94)\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u8c28\u614e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u6781\u7aef\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "TFT\u6a21\u578b\u5728REFIT\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u7535\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u5236\u5ea6\u8f6c\u6362\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

For i.i.d. data and the infinite-width NTK $k$, we prove a constant-limit law $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\mathbb{E}[r_{\\text{eff}}(K_n)] = \\mathbb{E}[k(x, x)]^2 / \\mathbb{E}[k(x, x')^2] =: r_\\infty$, with sub-Gaussian concentration.

By leveraging Haar wavelet transforms to enhance expressive capacity through frequency decomposition, HBLLM significantly improves quantization fidelity while maintaining minimal overhead. This approach features two innovative structure-aware grouping strategies: (1) frequency-aware multi-parameter intra-row grouping and (2) $\\ell_2$-norm-based saliency-driven column selection. For non-salient weights, a shared mean is employed across quantization groups within each frequency band to optimize storage efficiency. Experiments conducted on the OPT and LLaMA models demonstrate that HBLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in $1$-bit quantization, attaining a perplexity of $6.71$ on LLaMA$2$-$13$B with an average weight storage of only $1.08$ bits.

Termed ``synthetic data'', these generations are often produced before any student finetuning, but some work has considered generating new synthetic samples as training progresses. This paper studies and advocates for the latter case, where data are generated in an iterative, closed-loop fashion that is guided by the current state of the student model. For a fixed budget of generated samples, or a budget in terms of compute spent querying a teacher, we show that this curation of finetuning data affords improved student performance over static generation. Further, while there have been several LLM-specific methods proposed that operate in this regime, we find that simple, inexpensive selection criteria from the active learning literature tend to be most performant.

We present a fully reproducible benchmark that reports test accuracy together with wall-clock latency, peak CPU RAM, and peak GPU VRAM on four public datasets: Adult-Income, Higgs-100k, Wine-Quality, and California-Housing. Two open FMs (TabPFN-1.0 and TabICL-base) are compared against tuned XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest baselines on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU. The tree ensembles equal or surpass FM accuracy on three datasets while completing full-test batches in <= 0.40 s and <= 150 MB RAM, using zero VRAM. TabICL achieves a 0.8 percentage-point gain on Higgs but requires roughly 40,000 times more latency (960 s) and 9 GB VRAM.

Recent work studies RLVR through token entropy, arguing that high-entropy tokens drive exploration and should receive stronger updates. However, they overlook the fact that most of a reasoning trajectory consists of low-entropy segments that encode stable and reusable structural patterns. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we find that the overlap of low-entropy segments across correct responses strongly correlates with model accuracy, while overlaps involving incorrect responses exhibit stable but unproductive patterns. Motivated by these findings, we propose LESS, a correctness-aware reinforcement framework that performs fine-grained advantage modulation over low-entropy segments. LESS amplifies segments unique to correct responses, suppresses those unique to incorrect ones, and neutralizes segments shared by both, while preserving high-entropy exploration in the underlying RL algorithm. Instantiated on top of the popular GRPO, LESS consistently improves accuracy over strong RL baselines across three backbones and six math benchmarks, achieves stronger robustness of the performance floor.", "AI": {"tldr": "LESS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u63a7\u4f4e\u71b5\u6bb5\u6765\u589e\u5f3aRLVR\uff0c\u653e\u5927\u6b63\u786e\u54cd\u5e94\u72ec\u6709\u7684\u6bb5\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u9519\u8bef\u54cd\u5e94\u72ec\u6709\u7684\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e2d\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u6bb5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u71b5\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RLVR\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u71b5token\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u7531\u4f4e\u71b5\u6bb5\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6bb5\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6b63\u786e\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u4f4e\u71b5\u6bb5\u91cd\u53e0\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u9519\u8bef\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u4f4e\u71b5\u6bb5\u91cd\u53e0\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLESS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728GRPO\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u8c03\u5236\uff1a1) \u653e\u5927\u6b63\u786e\u54cd\u5e94\u72ec\u6709\u7684\u4f4e\u71b5\u6bb5\uff1b2) \u6291\u5236\u9519\u8bef\u54cd\u5e94\u72ec\u6709\u7684\u4f4e\u71b5\u6bb5\uff1b3) \u4e2d\u548c\u4e24\u8005\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u4f4e\u71b5\u6bb5\uff1b4) \u4fdd\u6301\u5e95\u5c42RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u71b5\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLESS\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3aRL\u57fa\u7ebf\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u9650\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4e\u71b5\u6bb5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0cLESS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u63a7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6bb5\u6765\u589e\u5f3aRLVR\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, real-world environments almost never realize fully group-invariant MDPs; dynamics, actuation limits, and reward design usually break symmetries, often only locally. Under group-invariant Bellman backups for such cases, local symmetry-breaking introduces errors that propagate across the entire state-action space, resulting in global value estimation errors. To address this, we introduce Partially group-Invariant MDP (PI-MDP), which selectively applies group-invariant or standard Bellman backups depending on where symmetry holds. This framework mitigates error propagation from locally broken symmetries while maintaining the benefits of equivariance, thereby enhancing sample efficiency and generalizability. Building on this framework, we present practical RL algorithms -- Partially Equivariant (PE)-DQN for discrete control and PE-SAC for continuous control -- that combine the benefits of equivariance with robustness to symmetry-breaking.

However, the collaborative industrial environment presents new challenges for MTS forecasting models: models should decouple complex inter-variable dependencies while addressing non-stationary distribution shift brought by environmental changes. To address these challenges and improve collaborative sensing reliability, we propose a Patch-Based Dual-Branch Channel-Temporal Forecasting Network (D-CTNet). Particularly, with a parallel dual-branch design incorporating linear temporal modeling layer and channel attention mechanism, our method explicitly decouples and jointly learns intra-channel temporal evolution patterns and dynamic multivariate correlations. Furthermore, a global patch attention fusion module goes beyond the local window scope to model long range dependencies.

Remarkably, they preserve knowledge of once-learned environments sans catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon neuroscientists hypothesize, is due to a singular neural circuitry dynamically overlayed by neuromodulatory agents such as dopamine and acetylcholine. In parallel, deep learning research addresses analogous challenges via domain generalization (DG) and continual learning (CL), yet these methods remain siloed, despite the brains ability to perform them seamlessly. In particular, prior work has not explored architectures involving associative memories (AMs), which are an integral part of biological systems, to jointly address these tasks. We propose Memory-Integrated Reconfigurable Adapters (MIRA), a unified framework that integrates Hopfield-style associative memory modules atop a shared backbone. Associative memory keys are learned post-hoc to index and retrieve an affine combination of stored adapter updates for any given task or domain on a per-sample basis. By varying only the task-specific objectives, we demonstrate that MIRA seamlessly accommodates domain shifts and sequential task exposures under one roof. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm that our AM-augmented architecture significantly enhances adaptability and retention: in DG, MIRA achieves SoTA out-of-distribution accuracy, and in incremental learning settings, it outperforms architectures explicitly designed to handle catastrophic forgetting using generic CL algorithms. By unifying adapter-based modulation with biologically inspired associative memory, MIRA delivers rapid task switching and enduring knowledge retention in a single extensible architecture, charting a path toward more versatile and memory-augmented AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "MIRA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8054\u60f3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u952e\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u9002\u914d\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u5927\u8111\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u5207\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u8fd9\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u8c03\u8282\u5242\uff08\u5982\u591a\u5df4\u80fa\u3001\u4e59\u9170\u80c6\u78b1\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u8986\u76d6\u5355\u4e00\u795e\u7ecf\u56de\u8def\u6709\u5173\u3002\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u4e92\u5b64\u7acb\uff0c\u4e14\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u8054\u60f3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5728\u8054\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMIRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e4b\u4e0a\u96c6\u6210Hopfield\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u8054\u60f3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u60f3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u952e\u6765\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6309\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u4ec5\u6539\u53d8\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u5373\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u66b4\u9732\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMIRA\u5728\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u95e8\u5904\u7406\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MIRA\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8054\u60f3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u4efb\u52a1\u5207\u6362\u548c\u6301\u4e45\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

We developed and adapted a multi-modal AI model to handle the asynchronous and incomplete nature of real-world RPM data, forecasting a continuous risk of future adverse events. The model achieved an accuracy of 83.9% (AUROC=0.70). Notably, the model identified previous treatments, wellness check-ins, and daily maximum heart rate as key predictive features.

A common mitigation approach is to apply some fixed orthogonal transforms, such as Hadamard matrices, before quantization, which typically reduces the dynamic range. Yet, these transforms ignore the statistics of the data, and their optimality is currently not understood. In this work, we derive, for the first time, closed-form optimal linear blockwise transforms for joint weight-activation quantization using standard data-free quantizers for common numerical formats. Specifically, we provide derivations of the optimal adaptive (data-aware) transforms for round-to-nearest (RTN), AbsMax-scaled block quantizers for both integer and floating-point formats. The resulting construction, which we call WUSH, combines a Hadamard backbone with a data-dependent component based on second-order moments, yielding a non-orthogonal transform that is provably optimal under mild assumptions and remains structured for efficient implementation.

Designing such reward functions can be challenging and may not generalize well across different tasks. To address this limitation, we leverage the rich world knowledge contained in pretrained video diffusion models to provide goal-driven reward signals for RL agents without ad-hoc design of reward. Our key idea is to exploit off-the-shelf video diffusion models pretrained on large-scale video datasets as informative reward functions in terms of video-level and frame-level goals. For video-level rewards, we first finetune a pretrained video diffusion model on domain-specific datasets and then employ its video encoder to evaluate the alignment between the latent representations of agent's trajectories and the generated goal videos. To enable more fine-grained goal-achievement, we derive a frame-level goal by identifying the most relevant frame from the generated video using CLIP, which serves as the goal state. We then employ a learned forward-backward representation that represents the probability of visiting the goal state from a given state-action pair as frame-level reward, promoting more coherent and goal-driven trajectories.

However, the gender, sex, race, and ethnicity of the patients in these datasets are underreported and subgroup-specific predictive performance is unevaluated. These reporting deficiencies raise concerns about subgroup validity that must be studied and addressed before model deployment. In this paper, we show that current open echocardiogram datasets are unable to assuage subgroup validity concerns. We improve sociodemographic reporting for two datasets: TMED-2 and MIMIC-IV-ECHO. Analysis of six open datasets reveals no consideration of gender-diverse patients and insufficient patient counts for many racial and ethnic groups. We further perform an exploratory subgroup analysis of two published aortic stenosis detection models on TMED-2. We find insufficient evidence for subgroup validity for sex, racial, and ethnic subgroups.

However, theoretically quantifying the capacities of their neural network architectures remains a significant challenge. In this study, the neural oscillator consisting of a second-order ODE followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is considered. Its upper approximation bound for approximating causal and uniformly continuous operators between continuous temporal function spaces and that for approximating uniformly asymptotically incrementally stable second-order dynamical systems are derived. The established proof method of the approximation bound for approximating the causal continuous operators can also be directly applied to state-space models consisting of a linear time-continuous complex recurrent neural network followed by an MLP. Theoretical results reveal that the approximation error of the neural oscillator for approximating the second-order dynamical systems scales polynomially with the reciprocals of the widths of two utilized MLPs, thus mitigating the curse of parametric complexity. The decay rates of two established approximation error bounds are validated through two numerical cases.

We propose an operator-theoretic framework that maps the $L^2$-optimal solution into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) via a forward operator, approximates it using available data, and maps back with the inverse operator, yielding a gradient-free scheme. Finite-sample bounds are derived using concentration inequalities over operator norms, and the framework identifies a data-dependent hypothesis space with guarantees on risk, error, robustness, and approximation. Within this space we design efficient kernel machines leveraging the space folding property of Kernel Affine Hull Machines. Clients transfer knowledge via a scalar space folding measure, reducing communication and enabling a simple differentially private protocol: summaries are computed from noise-perturbed data matrices in one step, avoiding per-round clipping and privacy accounting. The induced global rule requires only integer minimum and equality-comparison operations per test point, making it compatible with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Across four benchmarks, the gradient-free FL method with fixed encoder embeddings matches or outperforms strong gradient-based fine-tuning, with gains up to 23.7 points. In differentially private experiments, kernel smoothing mitigates accuracy loss in high-privacy regimes. The global rule admits an FHE realization using $Q \\times C$ encrypted minimum and $C$ equality-comparison operations per test point, with operation-level benchmarks showing practical latencies. Overall, the framework provides provable guarantees with low communication, supports private knowledge transfer via scalar summaries, and yields an FHE-compatible prediction rule offering a mathematically grounded alternative to gradient-based federated learning under heterogeneity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RKHS\u6620\u5c04\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5168\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u5c06L\u00b2\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411\u7b97\u5b50\u6620\u5c04\u5230RKHS\uff0c\u7528\u53ef\u7528\u6570\u636e\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u7b97\u5b50\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u6765\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6838\u4eff\u5c04\u5305\u673a\u5668\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6298\u53e0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u6298\u53e0\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5339\u914d\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u68af\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe23.7\u5206\u3002\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6838\u5e73\u6ed1\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u9ad8\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u3002\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5219\u652f\u6301FHE\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea7\u57fa\u51c6\u663e\u793a\u5b9e\u9645\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u91cf\u6458\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u79c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751fFHE\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u624e\u5b9e\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The method improved the baseline for unsupervised labeling of vocal units (i.e. syllables) through manifold learning, by investigating how dimen- sionality reduction on mel-spectrograms affects labeling, and comparing it with unsupervised labels based on acoustic similarity. We then encoded vocalizations as syllabic sequences to analyze the type of syntax, and extracted the Maximal Repetitions (MRs) to evaluate syntactical structures. We found evidence for: i) associative syntax, rather than combinatorial (context classification is unaffected by permutation of sequences, F 1 > 0.9); ii) context-dependent use of syllables (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, p-value < 0.05); iii) heavy-tail distribution of MRs (truncated power-law, exponent \u03b1 < 2), indicative of mechanism encoding com- binatorial complexity. Analysis of MRs and syllabic transition networks revealed that mother-pupil interactions were characterized by repetitions, while commu- nication in conflict-contexts exhibited higher complexity (longer MRs and more interconnected vocal sequences) than non-agonistic contexts.

Raisbeck", "Bruno Castro da Silva"], "title": "AltNet: Addressing the Plasticity-Stability Dilemma in Reinforcement Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Neural networks have shown remarkable success in supervised learning when trained on a single task using a fixed dataset. However, when neural networks are trained on a reinforcement learning task, their ability to continue learning from new experiences declines over time. This decline in learning ability is known as plasticity loss. To restore plasticity, prior work has explored periodically resetting the parameters of the learning network, a strategy that often improves overall performance. However, such resets come at the cost of a temporary drop in performance, which can be dangerous in real-world settings. To overcome this instability, we introduce AltNet, a reset-based approach that restores plasticity without performance degradation by leveraging twin networks. The use of twin networks anchors performance during resets through a mechanism that allows networks to periodically alternate roles: one network learns as it acts in the environment, while the other learns off-policy from the active network's interactions and a replay buffer.

Existing approaches, such as Static-lambda SISS for diffusion models, rely on a fixed mixing weight lambda, which is suboptimal because the required unlearning strength varies across samples and training stages.\n  We propose Adaptive-lambda SISS, a principled extension that turns lambda into a latent variable dynamically inferred at each training step. A lightweight inference network parameterizes an adaptive posterior over lambda, conditioned on contextual features derived from the instantaneous SISS loss terms (retain/forget losses and their gradients). This enables joint optimization of the diffusion model and the lambda-inference mechanism via a variational objective, yielding significantly better trade-offs.\n  We further extend the adaptive-lambda principle to score-based unlearning and introduce a multi-class variant of Score Forgetting Distillation. In addition, we present two new directions: (i) a hybrid objective combining the data-free efficiency of Score Forgetting Distillation with the direct gradient control of SISS, and (ii) a Reinforcement Learning formulation that treats unlearning as a sequential decision process, learning an optimal policy over a state space defined by the model's current memory of the forget set.\n  Experiments on an augmented MNIST benchmark show that Adaptive-lambda SISS substantially outperforms the original static-lambda SISS, achieving stronger removal of forgotten classes while better preserving generation quality on the retain set.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAdaptive-lambda SISS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u65adlambda\u503c\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9alambda\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Static-lambda SISS\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6743\u91cdlambda\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u591f\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6837\u672c\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u6240\u9700\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdaptive-lambda SISS\uff0c\u5c06lambda\u53d8\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u65ad\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684lambda\u503c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u4fdd\u7559/\u9057\u5fd8\u635f\u5931\u53ca\u5176\u68af\u5ea6\uff09\u53c2\u6570\u5316lambda\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u76ee\u6807\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548clambda\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u7684MNIST\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAdaptive-lambda SISS\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u7684\u9759\u6001lambda SISS\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u79fb\u9664\u9057\u5fd8\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94lambda\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u6837\u672c\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u9057\u5fd8\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8-\u4fdd\u7559\u6743\u8861\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002"}}

To overcome this challenge, we propose precipitation nowcasting using satellite imagery with physics constraints for improved accuracy and physical consistency. We use a novel physics-informed dual neural operator (PIANO) structure to enforce the fundamental equation of advection-diffusion during training to predict satellite imagery using a PINN loss. Then, we use a generative model to convert satellite images to radar images, which are used for precipitation nowcasting. Compared to baseline models, our proposed model shows a notable improvement in moderate (4mm/h) precipitation event prediction alongside short-term heavy (8mm/h) precipitation event prediction. It also demonstrates low seasonal variability in predictions, indicating robustness for generalization.

Preprint, to appear in KDD'26", "summary": "Algorithmic reasoning -- the ability to perform step-by-step logical inference -- has become a core benchmark for evaluating reasoning in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). Ideally, one would like to design a single model capable of performing well on multiple algorithmic reasoning tasks simultaneously. However, this is challenging when the execution steps of algorithms differ from one another, causing negative interference when they are trained together.\n  We propose branching neural networks, a principled architecture for multitask algorithmic reasoning. Searching for the optimal $k$-ary tree with $L$ layers over $n$ algorithmic tasks is combinatorial, requiring exploration of up to $k^{nL}$ possible structures. We develop AutoBRANE, an efficient algorithm that reduces this search to $O(nL)$ time by solving a convex relaxation at each layer to approximate an optimal task partition. The method clusters tasks using gradient-based affinity scores and can be used on top of any base model, including GNNs and LLMs.\n  We validate AutoBRANE on a broad suite of graph-algorithmic and text-based reasoning benchmarks. We show that gradient features estimate true task performance within 5% error across four GNNs and four LLMs (up to 34B parameters). On the CLRS benchmark, it outperforms the strongest single multitask GNN by 3.7% and the best baseline by 1.2%, while reducing runtime by 48% and memory usage by 26%. The learned branching structures reveal an intuitively reasonable hierarchical clustering of related algorithms. On three text-based graph reasoning benchmarks, AutoBRANE improves over the best non-branching multitask baseline by 3.2%. Finally, on a large graph dataset with 21M edges and 500 tasks, AutoBRANE achieves a 28% accuracy gain over existing multitask and branching architectures, along with a 4.5$\\times$ reduction in runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAutoBRANE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u652f\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1f\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728GNN\u548cLLM\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6b65\u9aa4\u5dee\u5f02\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u8d1f\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u652f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1AutoBRANE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51f8\u677e\u5f1b\u6c42\u89e3\u6bcf\u5c42\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4efb\u52a1\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u964d\u81f3\u7ebf\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CLRS\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u5355\u4efb\u52a1GNN\u63d0\u53473.7%\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53471.2%\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1148%\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c1126%\uff1b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u53473.2%\uff1b\u5728\u5927\u578b\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534728%\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c114.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoBRANE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728GNN\u548cLLM\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While robust training can reduce sensitivity to some forms of noise, it is infeasible to anticipate all possible OOD conditions. To mitigate this issue, we develop an algorithm that leverages a world model's inherent measure of surprise to reduce the impact of noise in world model--based reinforcement learning agents. We introduce both multi-representation and single-representation rejection sampling, enabling robustness to settings with multiple faulty sensors or a single faulty sensor. While the introduction of noise typically degrades agent performance, we show that our techniques preserve performance relative to baselines under varying types and levels of noise across multiple environments within self-driving simulation domains (CARLA and Safety Gymnasium). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methods enhance the stability of two state-of-the-art world models with markedly different underlying architectures: Cosmos and DreamerV3.

We propose the mode-conditioning (ModC) framework, which explicitly allocates test-time compute across reasoning modes using either specialist models or mode-specific prefixes. ModC consistently improves scaling across controlled graph-search tasks and large-scale reasoning benchmarks, spanning model families and sizes from 0.5B to 7B. On OpenThoughts, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B with ModC achieves a 4x efficiency gain over standard training while also improving the maximum attainable Pass@k.

Finally, we show that ModC improves reinforcement learning (RL) and can further boost diversity-inducing RL methods.

This is motivated by the \"Lottery Ticket Hypothesis\", which suggests the existence of smaller sub-networks within larger pre-trained networks that perform comparatively well (if not better). Whilst most literature in this area focuses on Deep Neural Networks more generally, we specifically consider Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification tasks. Building on the hypothesis, we compare simple magnitude-based pruning, a Frank-Wolfe style pruning scheme, and an FW method with momentum on a CNN trained on MNIST. Our experiments track test accuracy, loss, sparsity, and inference time as we vary the dense pre-training budget from 1 to 10 epochs. We find that FW with momentum yields pruned networks that are both sparser and more accurate than the original dense model and the simple pruning baselines, while incurring minimal inference-time overhead in our implementation. Moreover, FW with momentum reaches these accuracies after only a few epochs of pre-training, indicating that full pre-training of the dense model is not required in this setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u526a\u679d\u7684Frank-Wolfe\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e26\u52a8\u91cf\u7684FW\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\"\u5f69\u7968\u5047\u8bbe\"\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5c0f\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b80\u5355\u5e45\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u3001Frank-Wolfe\u98ce\u683c\u526a\u679d\u3001\u5e26\u52a8\u91cf\u7684FW\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\uff0c\u53d8\u5316\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6570\uff081-10\u8f6e\uff09\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u635f\u5931\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5e26\u52a8\u91cf\u7684FW\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7f51\u7edc\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u526a\u679d\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u5c0f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u5168\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Frank-Wolfe\u5e26\u52a8\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u526a\u679d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this problem, the goal is to construct a threshold decision tree that partitions data into k clusters while minimizing the k-medians objective. These trees are interpretable because each internal node makes a simple decision by thresholding a single feature, allowing users to trace and understand how each point is assigned to a cluster. We present the first algorithm for explainable k-medians under lp norm for every finite p >= 1. Our algorithm achieves an O(p(log k)^{1 + 1/p - 1/p^2}) approximation to the optimal k-medians cost for any p >= 1. Previously, algorithms were known only for p = 1 and p = 2. For p = 2, our algorithm improves upon the existing bound of O(log^{3/2}k), and for p = 1, it matches the tight bound of log k + O(1) up to a multiplicative O(log log k) factor. We show how to implement our algorithm in a dynamic setting.

Unlike traditional deep neural networks relying on black-box function fitting, we reformulate classification as interpretable geometric optimization on fiber bundles, where categories form the base space and wavelet-transformed features lie in the fibers above each category. We introduce two innovations: (1) learnable Riemannian metrics identifying important frequency feature components, (2) variational prototype optimization through energy function minimization. Classification is performed via Voronoi tessellation under the learned Riemannian metric, where each prototype defines a decision region and test samples are assigned to the nearest prototype, providing clear geometric interpretability. This work demonstrates that the integration of fiber bundle with machine learning provides interpretability and efficiency, which are difficult to obtain simultaneously in conventional deep learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "FiberNet\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u5fae\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea4\u7ef4\u675f\u4e0a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u9ece\u66fc\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u53d8\u5206\u539f\u578b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eVoronoi\u5212\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ed1\u7bb1\u51fd\u6570\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u5fae\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u5206\u7c7b\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7ea4\u7ef4\u675f\u4e0a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u7c7b\u522b\u6784\u6210\u57fa\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u7279\u5f81\u4f4d\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u65b9\u7684\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e2d\u30022. \u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u9ece\u66fc\u5ea6\u91cf\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u8981\u9891\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u91cf\u30023. \u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u53d8\u5206\u539f\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u30024. \u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9ece\u66fc\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684Voronoi\u5212\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u539f\u578b\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "FiberNet\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7ea4\u7ef4\u675f\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ea4\u7ef4\u675f\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Such shifts can take many forms: new classes may emerge that were absent during training, a problem known as open-set recognition, and the distribution of known categories may change. Guarantees on open-set recognition are mostly derived under the assumption that the distribution of known classes, which we call \\emph{the background distribution}, is fixed. In this paper we develop \\ours{}, a method that is guaranteed to solve open-set recognition even in the challenging case where the background distribution shifts. We prove that the method works under benign assumptions that the novel class is separable from the non-novel classes, and provide theoretical guarantees that it outperforms a representative baseline in a simplified overparameterized setting. We develop techniques to make \\ours{} scalable and robust, and perform comprehensive empirical evaluations on image and text data. The results show that \\ours{} significantly outperforms existing open-set recognition methods under background shift. Moreover, we provide new insights into how factors such as the size of the novel class influences performance, an aspect that has not been extensively explored in prior work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aOurs\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u80cc\u666f\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u5df2\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u80cc\u666f\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u80cc\u666f\u5206\u5e03\u4e5f\u4f1a\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u6311\u6218\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOurs\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0e\u975e\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u826f\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4f7f\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u80cc\u666f\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\uff0cOurs\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u5927\u5c0f\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u672a\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "Ours\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u80cc\u666f\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are models trained to approximate DFT-level energies and forces at dramatically lower computational cost. Many modern MLIPs rely on a scalar regression formulation; given information about a molecule, they predict a single energy value and corresponding forces while minimizing absolute error with DFT's calculations. In this work, we explore a multi-class classification formulation that predicts a categorical distribution over energy/force values, providing richer supervision through multiple targets. Most importantly, this approach offers a principled way to quantify model uncertainty.\n  In particular, our method predicts a histogram of the energy/force distribution, converts scalar targets into histograms, and trains the model using cross-entropy loss. Our results demonstrate that this categorical formulation can achieve absolute error performance comparable to regression baselines. Furthermore, this representation enables the quantification of epistemic uncertainty through the entropy of the predicted distribution, offering a measure of model confidence absent in scalar regression approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\u80fd\uff08MLIPs\uff09\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u91cf/\u529b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684MLIPs\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u91cf\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u4e00\u80fd\u91cf\u503c\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u529b\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u80fd\u91cf/\u529b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4ece\u6807\u91cf\u56de\u5f52\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\uff1a\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u91cf/\u529b\u7684\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5c06\u6807\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u71b5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6807\u91cf\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aMLIPs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional methods, such as FEM-based simulations offer high accuracy but computationally prohibitive for early-stage design, often requiring multiple iterative redesign cycles to resolve late-stage thermal failures. To address these challenges, we propose 'ThermAl', a physics-informed generative AI framework which effectively identifies heat sources and estimates full-chip transient and steady-state thermal distributions directly from input activity profiles. ThermAl employs a hybrid U-Net architecture enhanced with positional encoding and a Boltzmann regularizer to maintain physical fidelity. Our model is trained on an extensive dataset of heat dissipation maps, ranging from simple logic gates (e.g., inverters, NAND, XOR) to complex designs, generated via COMSOL. Experimental results demonstrate that ThermAl delivers precise temperature mappings for large circuits, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of only 0.71\u00b0C, and outperforms conventional FEM tools by running up to ~200 times faster. We analyze performance across diverse layouts and workloads, and discuss its applicability to large-scale EDA workflows. While thermal reliability assessments often extend beyond 85\u00b0C for post-layout signoff, our focus here is on early-stage hotspot detection and thermal pattern learning. To ensure generalization beyond the nominal operating range 25-55\u00b0C, we additionally performed cross-validation on an extended dataset spanning 25-95\u00b0C maintaining a high accuracy (<2.2% full-scale RMSE) even under elevated temperature conditions representative of peak power and stress scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "ThermAl\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210AI\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u6d3b\u52a8\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc6\u522b\u70ed\u6e90\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u5168\u82af\u7247\u77ac\u6001\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u70ed\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfFEM\u5de5\u5177\u5feb\u7ea6200\u500d\uff0cRMSE\u4ec5\u4e3a0.71\u00b0C\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u975e\u5747\u5300\u529f\u8017\u548c\u9ad8\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6e29\u5ea6\u5c16\u5cf0\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edfFEM\u4eff\u771f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u65e9\u671f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u540e\u671f\u70ed\u6545\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faThermAl\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6df7\u5408U-Net\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u5728COMSOL\u751f\u6210\u7684\u70ed\u8017\u6563\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u5230\u590d\u6742\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "ThermAl\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u7535\u8def\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u6e29\u5ea6\u6620\u5c04\uff0cRMSE\u4ec50.71\u00b0C\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfFEM\u5de5\u5177\u5feb\u7ea6200\u500d\u3002\u572825-95\u00b0C\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08<2.2%\u6ee1\u91cf\u7a0bRMSE\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "ThermAl\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u70ed\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u70ed\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21EDA\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Complex physical systems are often characterized through the integration of a limited number of point sensors in combination with scientific computations which approximate the dominant, full-state dynamics. Simulation models, however, inevitably neglect small-scale or hidden processes, are sensitive to perturbations, or oversimplify parameter correlations, leading to reconstructions that often diverge from the reality measured by sensors. This creates a critical need for data assimilation, the process of integrating observational data with predictive simulation models to produce coherent and accurate estimates of the full state of complex physical systems. We propose a machine learning framework for Data Assimilation with a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (DA-SHRED) which bridges the simulation-to-real (SIM2REAL) gap between computational modeling and experimental sensor data. For real-world physics systems modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields, where the full state cannot be directly observed and must be inferred from sparse sensor measurements, we leverage the latent space learned from a reduced simulation model via SHRED, and update these latent variables using real sensor data to accurately reconstruct the full system state. Furthermore, our algorithm incorporates a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics based regression model in the latent space to identify functionals corresponding to missing dynamics in the simulation model. We demonstrate that DA-SHRED successfully closes the SIM2REAL gap and additionally recovers missing dynamics in highly complex systems, demonstrating that the combination of efficient temporal encoding and physics-informed correction enables robust data assimilation.", "AI": {"tldr": "DA-SHRED\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d45\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4f20\u611f\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4f20\u611f\u8986\u76d6\u4e0b\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6216\u9690\u85cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u6765\u6574\u5408\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDA-SHRED\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528SHRED\u4ece\u7b80\u5316\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u65b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u8bc6\u522b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "DA-SHRED\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9ad8\u6548\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "DA-SHRED\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6062\u590d\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce Counter-Example-Driven Curricula (CEDC), an automated framework that improves model robustness by iteratively focusing on its own failures. At each step, CEDC uses the current model to generate a diverse set of candidate problems, employs a fast, executable verifier to identify incorrect predictions (counter-examples), and then fine-tunes the model on a dataset enriched with these discovered failures. We evaluate CEDC on a suite of algorithmic and natural language tasks, including integer addition, sorting, Dyck-2 language recognition, and three text classification benchmarks.

Existing methods fall broadly into two categories: autoregressive models, which iteratively expand graphs, and one-shot models, such as diffusion, which generate the full graph at once.

Building on this, we propose LGDC (latent graph diffusion via spectrum-preserving coarsening), a hybrid framework that combines strengths of both approaches. LGDC employs a spectrum-preserving coarsening-decoarsening to bidirectionally map between graphs and a latent space, where diffusion efficiently generates latent graphs before expansion restores detail.

However, the high cost of measurement acquisition and the substantial distributional shifts in temperature field across varying conditions present significant challenges for developing reconstruction models with robust generalization capabilities. Existing DNNs-based methods typically formulate TFR-HSS as a one-to-one regression problem based solely on target sparse measurements, without effectively leveraging reference simulation data that implicitly encode thermal knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose IPTR, an implicit physics-guided temperature field reconstruction framework that introduces sparse monitoring-temperature field pair from reference simulations as priors to enrich physical understanding. To integrate both reference and target information, we design a dual physics embedding module consisting of two complementary branches: an implicit physics-guided branch employing cross-attention to distill latent physics from the reference data, and an auxiliary encoding branch based on Fourier layers to capture the spatial characteristics of the target observation. The fused representation is then decoded to reconstruct the full temperature field.

However, inferring these factors from neural activity remains a significant challenge. To build general-purpose representations that allow for resolving information about a neuron's identity, we introduce NuCLR, a self-supervised framework that aims to learn representations of neural activity that allow for differentiating one neuron from the rest. NuCLR brings together views of the same neuron observed at different times and across different stimuli and uses a contrastive objective to pull these representations together. To capture population context without assuming any fixed neuron ordering, we build a spatiotemporal transformer that integrates activity in a permutation-equivariant manner. Across multiple electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets, a linear decoding evaluation on top of NuCLR representations achieves a new state-of-the-art for both cell type and brain region decoding tasks, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen animals. We present the first systematic scaling analysis for neuron-level representation learning, showing that increasing the number of animals used during pretraining consistently improves downstream performance. The learned representations are also label-efficient, requiring only a small fraction of labeled samples to achieve competitive performance. These results highlight how large, diverse neural datasets enable models to recover information about neuron identity that generalize across animals.

The simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) can both transmit and reflect signals, enabling comprehensive signal control and expanding application scenarios. This paper introduces an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to further enhance system flexibility and proposes an optimization design for the spectrum efficiency of the STAR-RIS-UAV-assisted wireless communication system. We present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm capable of iteratively optimizing beamforming, phase shifts, and UAV positioning to maximize the system's sum rate through continuous interactions with the environment. To improve exploration in deterministic policies, we introduce a stochastic perturbation factor, which enhances exploration capabilities. As exploration is strengthened, the algorithm's ability to accurately evaluate the state-action value function becomes critical. Thus, based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, we propose a convolution-augmented deep deterministic policy gradient (CA-DDPG) algorithm that balances exploration and evaluation to improve the system's sum rate. The simulation results demonstrate that the CA-DDPG algorithm effectively interacts with the environment, optimizing the beamforming matrix, phase shift matrix, and UAV location, thereby improving system capacity and achieving better performance than other algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u589e\u5f3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\uff08CA-DDPG\uff09\u7684STAR-RIS-UAV\u8f85\u52a9\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6750\u6599\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u900f\u5c04\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08STAR-RIS\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u5168\u9762\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAV\uff09\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316STAR-RIS-UAV\u8f85\u52a9\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5377\u79ef\u589e\u5f3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\uff08CA-DDPG\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728DDPG\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u56e0\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u6539\u8fdb\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u77e9\u9635\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCA-DDPG\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CA-DDPG\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u4e86STAR-RIS-UAV\u8f85\u52a9\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that this reliance on diffusive learning creates \"Catastrophic Rigidity\", rendering models unable to adapt to novel concepts without destroying their pre-trained reasoning capabilities. To isolate this phenomenon, we introduce Iterative Semantic Map Refinement (ISMR), a diagnostic protocol revealing that alignment is a fixed geometric barrier that scaling cannot solve; a 20-layer model overcomes this barrier no faster than a 1-layer model. We introduce the Phase-Resonant Intelligent Spectral Model (PRISM). PRISM encodes semantic identity as resonant frequencies in the complex domain (C^d) and replaces quadratic self-attention with linearithmic O(N log N) Gated Harmonic Convolutions. We validate PRISM on the WMT14 translation task. While the Standard Transformer maintains a slight edge in general competence on static benchmarks (23.88 vs 21.40 BLEU), it fails the \"Plasticity-Stability\" stress test completely. When injected with novel concepts, the Transformer suffers Catastrophic Forgetting, degrading by -10.55 BLEU points while achieving only 60% acquisition. In contrast, PRISM demonstrates Lossless Plasticity, achieving 96% 5-shot acquisition with negligible degradation (-0.84 BLEU).

Traditional linear models cannot capture the complex nonlinear characteristics of electricity pricing, necessitating advanced machine learning approaches. This study compares eight machine learning models using Spanish electricity market data, integrating consumption, generation, and meteorological variables. The models evaluated include linear regression, ridge regression, decision tree, KNN, random forest, gradient boosting, SVR, and XGBoost. Results show that KNN achieves the best performance with R^2 of 0.865, MAE of 3.556, and RMSE of 5.240.

While prior work focus on developing unified verifiers applicable across multiple reasoning scenarios, significant challenges remain in computation-oriented scientific domains, such as algebraic equivalence checking and physical constant substitution. In this paper, we introduce \\model, a tool-augmented verifier that leverages external executors to perform precise computations and symbolic simplifications. \\model enables robust verification that goes beyond simple semantic matching. We propose a novel two-stage pipeline, which begin with cold-start fine-tuning and followed by multi-turn reinforcement learning with tool integration. Extensive experiments conducted on STEM subjects, general QA, and long-form reasoning tasks demonstrates strong generalization of \\model.

Nonetheless, recent theoretical insights presented in CAR suggest a potential alignment, raising the important question of how to realize this in practice. This paper first identifies a key gap between theory and practice by comparing standard policy optimization (SPO) and adversarially robust policy optimization (ARPO). Although they share theoretical consistency, a fundamental tension between robustness and optimality arises in practical policy gradient methods. SPO tends toward convergence to vulnerable first-order stationary policies (FOSPs) with strong natural performance, whereas ARPO typically favors more robust FOSPs at the expense of reduced returns. Furthermore, we attribute this tradeoff to the reshaping effect of the strongest adversary in ARPO, which significantly complicates the global landscape by inducing deceptive sticky FOSPs. This improves robustness but makes navigation more challenging. To alleviate this, we develop the BARPO, a bilevel framework unifying SPO and ARPO by modulating adversary strength, thereby facilitating navigability while preserving global optima. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that BARPO consistently outperforms vanilla ARPO, providing a practical approach to reconcile theoretical and empirical performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faBARPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u5bf9\u6297\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7edf\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5230\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136CAR\u7406\u8bba\u8868\u660e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6807\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316(SPO)\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316(ARPO)\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5f20\u529b\uff1aSPO\u6536\u655b\u5230\u8106\u5f31\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0cARPO\u504f\u5411\u9c81\u68d2\u4f46\u56de\u62a5\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f25\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBARPO\u53cc\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u5bf9\u6297\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6765\u7edf\u4e00SPO\u548cARPO\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514dARPO\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6297\u8005\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u7c98\u6edeFOSP\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBARPO\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbARPO\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u534f\u8c03\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "BARPO\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u5bf9\u6297\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Inspired by the MoE design paradigms established in large language models (LLMs), we identify a set of crucial architectural factors for building effective Diffusion MoE models--including DeepSeek-style expert modules, alternative intermediate widths, varying expert counts, and enhanced attention positional encodings. Our systematic study reveals that carefully tuning these configurations is essential for unlocking the full potential of Diffusion MoE models, often yielding gains that exceed those achieved by routing innovations alone. Through extensive experiments, we present novel architectures that can be efficiently applied to both latent and pixel-space diffusion frameworks, which provide a practical and efficient training recipe that enables Diffusion MoE models to surpass strong baselines while using equal or fewer activated parameters.

However, such lengthy generation shifts the inference bottleneck from compute-bound to memory-bound. To generate each token, the model applies full attention to all previously generated tokens, requiring memory access to an increasingly large KV-Cache. Consequently, longer generations demand more memory access for every step, leading to substantial pressure on memory bandwidth.\n  To address this, we introduce SparseSpec, a speculative decoding framework that reuses the same model as the draft and target models (i.e., self-speculation). SparseSpec features a novel sparse attention mechanism, PillarAttn, as the draft model, which accurately selects critical tokens via elegantly reusing information from the verification stage. Furthermore, SparseSpec co-designs self-speculation with three system innovations: (1) a unified scheduler to batch token drafting and verification, (2) delayed verification for CPU/GPU overlap, and (3) dynamic KV-Cache management to maximize memory utilization. Across various models and datasets, SparseSpec outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, with an up to 2.13x throughput speedup.", "AI": {"tldr": "SparseSpec\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u957f\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe2.13\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u74f6\u9888\u4ece\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u8f6c\u5411\u5185\u5b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u7684\u751f\u6210\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u4e4b\u524d\u6240\u6709token\u8fdb\u884c\u5b8c\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4KV\u7f13\u5b58\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5927\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7ed9\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u5e26\u6765\u5de8\u5927\u538b\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSparseSpec\u81ea\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8349\u7a3f\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) PillarAttn\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\u4fe1\u606f\u51c6\u786e\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952etoken\uff1b2) \u7edf\u4e00\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u6279\u91cf\u5904\u7406token\u8349\u7a3f\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b3) \u5ef6\u8fdf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u73b0CPU/GPU\u91cd\u53e0\uff1b4) \u52a8\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSparseSpec\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe2.13\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "SparseSpec\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of flow matching remains limited, particularly in terms of sample complexity results. In this work, we provide the first analysis of the sample complexity for flow-matching based generative models without assuming access to the empirical risk minimizer (ERM) of the loss function for estimating the velocity field. Under standard assumptions on the loss function for velocity field estimation and boundedness of the data distribution, we show that a sufficiently expressive neural network can learn a velocity field such that with $\\mathcal{O}(\u03b5^{-4})$ samples, such that the Wasserstein-2 distance between the learned and the true distribution is less than $\\mathcal{O}(\u03b5)$. The key technical idea is to decompose the velocity field estimation error into neural-network approximation error, statistical error due to the finite sample size, and optimization error due to the finite number of optimization steps for estimating the velocity field. Each of these terms are then handled via techniques that may be of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528O(\u03b5\u207b\u2074)\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u4f7f\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684Wasserstein-2\u8ddd\u79bb\u5c0f\u4e8eO(\u03b5)\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91c7\u6837\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6709\u9650\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bef\u5dee\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u4f30\u8ba1\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u6709\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5145\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f7f\u7528O(\u03b5\u207b\u2074)\u6837\u672c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684Wasserstein-2\u8ddd\u79bb\u5c0f\u4e8eO(\u03b5)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) addresses this by reducing the precision of model weights, typically to 4-bit or lower. However, uniform quantization often leads to significant performance degradation due to the presence of ``outlier features'' -- weights that, while few in number, are critical for maintaining model accuracy. Current state-of-the-art methods such as AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) and SpQR (Sparse Quantization Representations) rely on calibration data to identify these salient weights via activation magnitudes or Hessian sensitivity. In scenarios where data privacy is paramount or calibration data is unavailable, these methods are inapplicable.\n  In this work, we propose a data-free, structure-aware hypothesis: that the weights identified as Principal Components via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are intrinsically important to the model's downstream performance. We introduce a novel selection heuristic that preserves the top-$k$ weights aligned with the principal components in FP32, while aggressively quantizing the residual weights. We compare our method against activation-aware (AWQ) and second-order (SpQR) methods across GLUE benchmarks (MRPC, RTE, QNLI) using a DistilBERT backbone. Our experiments reveal that structural importance is highly correlated with functional importance.

However, it is challenging to translate neural predictive models into medical artificial intelligent applications due to the limitations of domain shift and label scarcity.

We demonstrated that the directed evolution algorithm is an effective strategy for uncertainty exploration, enhancing generalization in reinforcement learning. Furthermore, by incorporating replay buffer and continual backpropagate methods into DEM, we provide evidence of achieving better trade-off between exploitation and exploration in continuous learning settings. We conducted experiments on four different datasets for children with cochlear implants whose spoken language developmental outcomes vary considerably on the individual-child level. Preoperative neural MRI data has shown to accurately predict the post-operative outcome of these children within but not across datasets.

When the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) uses the \"0/1\" binary method (\"pass/fail\") to evaluate the visual spatial cognitive ability represented by the Cube Copying Test(CCT), the elder with less formal education generally score 0 point, resulting in serious bias in the evaluation results. Therefore, this study proposes a fine evaluation method for CCT based on dynamic handwriting feature extraction of DH-SCSM-BLA. method : The Cogni-CareV3.0 software independently developed by our team was used to collect dynamic handwriting data of CCT. Then, the spatial and motion features of segmented dynamic handwriting were extracted, and feature matrix with unequal dimensions were normalized. Finally, a bidirectional long short-term memory network model combined with attention mechanism (BiLSTM-Attention) was adopted for classification. Result: The experimental results showed that: The proposed method has significant superiority compared to similar studies, with a classification accuracy of 86.69%. The distribution of cube drawing ability scores has significant regularity for three aspects such as MCI patients and healthy control group, age, and levels of education. It was also found that score for each cognitive task including cube drawing ability score is negatively correlated with age. Score for each cognitive task including cube drawing ability score, but positively correlated with levels of education significantly.

Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization.

Recent denoising diffusion decoders with transformer backbones achieve state-of-the-art performance, but their iterative sampling limits practicality in low-latency settings. We introduce the Error Correction Consistency Flow Model (ECCFM), an architecture-agnostic training framework for high-fidelity one-step decoding. By casting the reverse denoising process as a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) and enforcing smoothness through a differential time regularization, ECCFM learns to map noisy signals along the decoding trajectory directly to the original codeword in a single inference step.

Existing adaptation strategies, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, focus on individual models and do not exploit the complementary strengths across models. Probing methods offer a promising alternative by extracting information from frozen models, but current techniques do not scale well with large feature sets and often rely on dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. We propose Combined backBones (ComBo), a simple and scalable probing-based adapter that effectively integrates features from multiple models and layers. ComBo compresses activations from layers of one or more FMs into compact token-wise representations and processes them with a lightweight transformer for task-specific prediction. Crucially, ComBo does not require dataset-specific tuning or backpropagation through the backbone models. However, not all models are equally relevant for all tasks. To address this, we introduce a mechanism that leverages ComBo's joint multi-backbone probing to efficiently evaluate each backbone's task-relevance, enabling both practical model comparison and improved performance through selective adaptation. On the 19 tasks of the VTAB-1k benchmark, ComBo outperforms previous probing methods, matches or surpasses more expensive alternatives, such as distillation-based model merging, and enables efficient probing of tuned models. Our results demonstrate that ComBo offers a practical and general-purpose framework for combining diverse representations from multiple FMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "ComBo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Transformer\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u5728VTAB-1k\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u8c03\u53c2\u3002", "method": "ComBo\u538b\u7f29\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u5c42\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684token\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Transformer\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u673a\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728VTAB-1k\u57fa\u51c6\u768419\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cComBo\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u524d\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u6d4b\u8c03\u4f18\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "ComBo\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u8c03\u4f18\u6216\u901a\u8fc7\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3002"}}

This limitation weakens human interpretability and trust in long-horizon models. To address these issues, we identify four key requirements for interpretable time-series modeling: temporal continuity, pattern-centric explanation, causal disentanglement, and faithfulness to the model's inference process. We propose EXCAP, a unified framework that satisfies all four requirements. EXCAP combines an attention-based segmenter that extracts coherent temporal patterns, a causally structured decoder guided by a pre-trained causal graph, and a latent aggregation mechanism that enforces representation stability. Our theoretical analysis shows that EXCAP provides smooth and stable explanations over time and is robust to perturbations in causal masks. Extensive experiments on classification and forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EXCAP achieves strong predictive accuracy while generating coherent and causally grounded explanations.

Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful framework for learning mappings between function spaces directly from data, enabling efficient surrogate models for PDE systems. Among these architectures, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has become the most influential and widely adopted due to its elegant spectral formulation, which captures global correlations through learnable transformations in Fourier space while remaining invariant to discretization and resolution. Despite their success, the practical use of FNOs is often hindered by an incomplete understanding among practitioners of their theoretical foundations, practical constraints, and implementation details, which can lead to their incorrect or unreliable application. This work presents a comprehensive and practice-oriented guide to FNOs, unifying their mathematical principles with implementation strategies. We provide an intuitive exposition to the concepts of operator theory and signal-processing that underlie the FNO, detail its spectral parameterization and the computational design of all its components, and address common misunderstandings encountered in the literature. The exposition is closely integrated with the NeuralOperator 2.0.0 library, offering modular state-of-the-art implementations that faithfully reflect the theory.

Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion.

However, existing methods often experience substantial performance degradation compared with individually fine-tuned models, even on similar tasks, underscoring the need to preserve task-specific information. This paper proposes Decomposition, Thresholding, and Scaling (DTS), an approximation-based personalized merging framework that preserves task-specific information with minimal storage overhead. DTS first applies singular value decomposition to the task-specific information and retains only a small subset of singular values and vectors. It then introduces a novel thresholding strategy that partitions singular vector elements into groups and assigns a scaling factor to each group. To enable generalization to unseen tasks, we further extend DTS with a variant that fuses task-specific information in a data-free manner based on the semantic similarity of task characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while requiring only 1\\% additional storage per task. Furthermore, experiments on unseen tasks show that the DTS variant achieves significantly better generalization performance.

We introduce Differentiable Weightless Controllers (DWCs), a symbolic-differentiable architecture that maps real-valued observations to actions using thermometer-encoded inputs, sparsely connected boolean lookup-table layers, and lightweight action heads. DWCs can be trained end-to-end by gradient-based techniques, yet compile directly into FPGA-compatible circuits with few- or even single-clock-cycle latency and nanojoule-level energy cost per action. Across five MuJoCo benchmarks, including high-dimensional Humanoid, DWCs achieve returns competitive with weight-based policies (full precision or quantized neural networks), matching performance on four tasks and isolating network capacity as the key limiting factor on HalfCheetah. Furthermore, DWCs exhibit structurally sparse and interpretable connectivity patterns, enabling a direct inspection of which input thresholds influence control decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u903b\u8f91\u7535\u8def\u800c\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u65e0\u6743\u91cd\u63a7\u5236\u5668(DWC)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e29\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7f16\u7801\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u5e03\u5c14\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u5c42\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u52a8\u4f5c\u5934\u5b9e\u73b0FPGA\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u903b\u8f91\u7535\u8def\u66ff\u4ee3\u8fde\u7eed\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u65e0\u6743\u91cd\u63a7\u5236\u5668(DWC)\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u6e29\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7f16\u7801\u5c06\u5b9e\u503c\u89c2\u6d4b\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u5e03\u5c14\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u5c42\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u52a8\u4f5c\u5934\u8f93\u51fa\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u652f\u6301\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3aFPGA\u517c\u5bb9\u7535\u8def\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2aMuJoCo\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u7ef4Humanoid\uff09\uff0cDWC\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6216\u91cf\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728HalfCheetah\u4e0a\u7f51\u7edc\u5bb9\u91cf\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\u3002DWC\u5177\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u903b\u8f91\u7535\u8def\uff0cDWC\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet many of these models circulate with their internal semantics undocumented or even intentionally withheld. Such opaque classifiers, which may expose only hard-label outputs, can operate in unregulated web environments or be repurposed for unknown intents, raising legitimate forensic and auditing concerns. In this paper, we position ourselves as investigators and work to infer the semantic concept each label encodes in an undocumented black-box classifier.\n  Specifically, we introduce label forensics, a black-box framework that reconstructs a label's semantic meaning. Concretely, we represent a label by a sentence embedding distribution from which any sample reliably reflects the concept the classifier has implicitly learned for that label. We believe this distribution should maintain two key properties: precise, with samples consistently classified into the target label, and general, covering the label's broad semantic space. To realize this, we design a semantic neighborhood sampler and an iterative optimization procedure to select representative seed sentences that jointly maximize label consistency and distributional coverage. The final output, an optimized seed sentence set combined with the sampler, constitutes the empirical distribution representing the label's semantics. Experiments on multiple black-box classifiers achieve an average label consistency of around 92.24 percent, demonstrating that the embedding regions accurately capture each classifier's label semantics.

Such problems are representative of practical settings where decision-makers have to deal with uncertainty in the operational environment as well as multiple conflicting objectives due to different stakeholders. We specifically consider travel time uncertainty. We also consider two objectives, total travel time and route makespan, that jointly target operational efficiency and labor regulations on shift length, although different objectives could be incorporated. Learning-based methods offer earnest computational advantages as they can repeatedly solve problems with limited interference from the decision-maker. We specifically focus on end-to-end deep learning models that leverage the attention mechanism and multiple solution trajectories. These models have seen several successful applications in routing problems. However, since travel times are not a direct input to these models due to the large dimensions of the travel time matrix, accounting for uncertainty is a challenge, especially in the presence of multiple objectives. In turn, we propose a model that simultaneously addresses stochasticity and multi-objectivity and provide a refined training mechanism for this model through scenario clustering to reduce training time.

Measuring the Gap Between Implicit Associations, Self-Report, and Behavioral Altruism", "comment": "14 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables. Code and data available at https://github.com/sandroandric/LLMs_Altruism_Study_Code", "summary": "We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models \"know\" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08).

A powerful framework for addressing such challenges is hierarchical probabilistic modeling, where uncertainty is represented by intermediate variables and resolved through marginalization during inference. Inspired by this principle, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing), a hierarchical reconstruction framework that integrates an autoencoder-diffusion cascade. First, a neural operator-based functional autoencoder reconstructs the dominant structures of the original field - including large-scale components and geometric boundaries - from arbitrary sparse inputs, serving as an intermediate variable. Then, a conditional diffusion model, trained with a mask-cascade strategy, generates fine-scale details conditioned on these large-scale structures. To further enhance fidelity, measurement consistency is enforced via the manifold constrained gradient based on Bayesian posterior sampling during the generation process. This cascaded pipeline substantially alleviates ill-posedness, delivering accurate and robust reconstructions. Experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate that Cas-Sensing generalizes well across varying sensor configurations and geometric boundaries, making it a promising tool for practical deployment in scientific and engineering applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cas-Sensing\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u968f\u673a\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u573a\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u6269\u6563\u7ea7\u8054\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5904\u7406\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u573a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCas-Sensing\u5206\u5c42\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u8f93\u5165\u91cd\u5efa\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u7ea7\u8054\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b3) \u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u7ea6\u675f\u68af\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCas-Sensing\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "Cas-Sensing\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u573a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We study these neural dynamics jointly with a benchmark encompassing 22 LLMs varying in size and architecture type. Our analyses confirm that LLMs and the brain generate representations in a similar order: specifically, activations in the initial layers of LLMs tend to best align with early brain responses, while the deeper layers of LLMs tend to best align with later brain responses.

Our approach produces bounded, interpretable metrics decomposed into \\textit{Entity Grounding} (EG), measuring whether entities in the response appear in source documents, and \\textit{Relation Preservation} (RP), verifying that asserted relationships are supported by context. On structured control documents, HalluGraph achieves near-perfect discrimination ($>$400 words, $>$20 entities), HalluGraph achieves $AUC = 0.979$, while maintaining robust performance ($AUC \\approx 0.89$) on challenging generative legal task, consistently outperforming semantic similarity baselines. The framework provides the transparency and traceability required for high-stakes legal applications, enabling full audit trails from generated assertions back to source passages.", "AI": {"tldr": "HalluGraph\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684RAG\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f53\u63a5\u5730\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4fdd\u6301\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002", "motivation": "\u6cd5\u5f8bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5f15\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u6cd5\u3001\u6cd5\u89c4\u6216\u5408\u540c\u6761\u6b3e\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u6e90\u6587\u6863\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5b9e\u4f53\u66ff\u6362\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u540e\u679c\uff08\u5982\u6df7\u6dc6\u5f53\u4e8b\u4eba\u3001\u65e5\u671f\u6216\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6761\u6b3e\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHalluGraph\u56fe\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f53\u63a5\u5730\uff08EG\uff09\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4fdd\u6301\uff08RP\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\uff08>400\u8bcd\uff0c>20\u5b9e\u4f53\uff09\uff0cHalluGraph\u8fbe\u5230AUC=0.979\uff1b\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\uff08AUC\u22480.89\uff09\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HalluGraph\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e3b\u5f20\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5230\u6e90\u6587\u6863\u6bb5\u843d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002"}}

Current systems increasingly operate in rapidly evolving environments that generate diverse yet interconnected data modalities -- such as time series, system logs, and tabular records -- as exemplified by modern IT systems. Effective AD methods in such environments must therefore possess two critical capabilities: (1) the ability to handle heterogeneous data formats within a unified framework, allowing the model to process and detect multiple modalities in a consistent manner during anomalous events; (2) a strong generalization ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios without extensive retraining. However, most existing methods fall short of these requirements, as they typically focus on single modalities and lack the flexibility to generalize across domains. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm: In-Context Anomaly Detection (ICAD), where anomalies are defined by their dissimilarity to a relevant reference set of normal samples. Under this paradigm, we propose ICAD-LLM, a unified AD framework leveraging Large Language Models' in-context learning abilities to process heterogeneous data within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICAD-LLM achieves competitive performance with task-specific AD methods and exhibits strong generalization to previously unseen tasks, which substantially reduces deployment costs and enables rapid adaptation to new environments. To the best of our knowledge, ICAD-LLM is the first model capable of handling anomaly detection tasks across diverse domains and modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faICAD-LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u573a\u666f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u79cd\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u3001\u8868\u683c\u8bb0\u5f55\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08ICAD\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u6b63\u5e38\u53c2\u8003\u96c6\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\u5f02\u5e38\u3002\u5f00\u53d1ICAD-LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e", "result": "ICAD-LLM\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u73af\u5883", "conclusion": "ICAD-LLM\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6"}}

While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. The results show that Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs and 19X on GPUs over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware.

Here we introduce a geometry-independent operator-learning framework that predicts local activation time (LAT) fields across diverse left atrial anatomies with near-instantaneous inference. We generated a dataset of 308,700 simulations using a GPU-accelerated electrophysiology solver, systematically varying multiple pacing sites and physiologically varied conduction properties across 147 patient-specific geometries derived from two independent clinical cohorts. All anatomical and functional data are expressed in a Universal Atrium Coordinate system, providing a consistent representation that decouples electrophysiological patterns from mesh topology. Within this coordinate space, we designed a neural operator with a vision-transformer backbone to learn the mapping from structural and electrophysiological inputs to LAT fields. With a mean prediction error of 5.1 ms over a 455 ms maximum simulation time, the model outperforms established operator-learning approaches and performs inference in 0.12 ms per sample.

However, due to data heterogeneity across nodes and the local gradient noise within each node, this strategy can lead to the drift of local models away from the global optimum. To address this issue, we revisit the well-known federated learning method Scaffold (Karimireddy et al., 2020) under a gradient tracking perspective, and propose a unified spatio-temporal gradient tracking algorithm, termed ST-GT, for distributed stochastic optimization over time-varying graphs. ST-GT tracks the global gradient across neighboring nodes to mitigate data heterogeneity, while maintaining a running average of local gradients to substantially suppress noise, with slightly more storage overhead. Without assuming bounded data heterogeneity, we prove that ST-GT attains a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems and a sublinear rate for nonconvex cases. Notably, ST-GT achieves the first linear speed-up in communication complexity with respect to the number of local updates per round $\u03c4$ for the strongly-convex setting. Compared to traditional gradient tracking methods, ST-GT reduces the topology-dependent noise term from $\u03c3^2$ to $\u03c3^2/\u03c4$, where $\u03c3^2$ denotes the noise level, thereby improving communication efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faST-GT\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u68af\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u672c\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u53d8\u56fe\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u901a\u5e38\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b21\u672c\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u672c\u5730\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u79bb\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eScaffold\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u68af\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5ST-GT\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u76f8\u90bb\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u62a4\u672c\u5730\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u5e73\u5747\u6765\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u7565\u5fae\u589e\u52a0\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u6709\u754c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cST-GT\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u7387\u3002\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6bcf\u8f6e\u672c\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u6b21\u6570\u03c4\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u52a0\u901f\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u68af\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5c06\u62d3\u6251\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9879\u4ece\u03c3\u00b2\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u03c3\u00b2/\u03c4\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-GT\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u68af\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u672c\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u6b21\u6570\u8f83\u591a\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}

We suggest that not only agents but also specialized software modules for scientific and engineering tasks can be generated on demand. We demonstrate this concept in the field of solid mechanics. There, so-called constitutive models are required to describe the relationship between mechanical stress and body deformation. Constitutive models are essential for both the scientific understanding and industrial application of materials. However, even recent data-driven methods of constitutive modeling, such as constitutive artificial neural networks (CANNs), still require substantial expert knowledge and human labor. We present a framework in which an LLM generates a CANN on demand, tailored to a given material class and dataset provided by the user. The framework covers LLM-based architecture selection, integration of physical constraints, and complete code generation. Evaluation on three benchmark problems demonstrates that LLM-generated CANNs achieve accuracy comparable to or greater than manually engineered counterparts, while also exhibiting reliable generalization to unseen loading scenarios and extrapolation to large deformations.

We validate our method on standard PDE benchmarks (elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, porous flow) and large-scale aerodynamic datasets (ShapeNet-Car, Ahmed-ML), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially lower memory footprint and computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "MSPT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8865\u4e01Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u8865\u4e01\u5185\u70b9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c40\u90e8\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u5168\u5c40\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355GPU\u4e0a\u5904\u7406\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9762\u4e34\u5173\u952e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u6349\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u7a7a\u95f4\u5143\u7d20\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c40\u90e8\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u5168\u5c40\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8865\u4e01Transformer\uff08MSPT\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u8865\u4e01\u5185\u70b9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7403\u6811\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u57df\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u51e0\u4f55\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6PDE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5f39\u6027\u3001\u5851\u6027\u3001\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u591a\u5b54\u6d41\uff09\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08ShapeNet-Car, Ahmed-ML\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "MSPT\u80fd\u591f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5355GPU\u4e0a\u5904\u7406\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

Therefore, protecting personally identifiable information (PII) during LLM training remains a fundamental challenge. Conventional methods like Differential Privacy-Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) provide robust privacy protection via uniform noising, protecting PII regardless of its distinct sensitivity. This comes at the expense of the model's utility, leading to a trade-off. In this paper, we propose SA-ADP, a sensitivity-aware approach that allocates noise based on the sensitivity of individual PII. We evaluated our method on four datasets (ABCD, CUSTOMERSIM, Wikitext-2, and UNSW-NB15 ). Our results show that SA-ADP achieves results comparable to the baseline (No-DP) and the conventional DP-SGD.

These are highly porous crystalline materials used to harvest water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide, store toxic gases and catalyse chemical reactions. In recognition of their value, the development of MOFs recently received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n  In many ways, MOFs are well-suited for exploiting generative models in chemistry: they are rationally-designable materials with a large combinatorial design space and strong structure-property couplings. And yet, to date, a high performance generative model has been lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce Mofasa, a general-purpose latent diffusion model that jointly samples positions, atom-types and lattice vectors for systems as large as 500 atoms. Mofasa avoids handcrafted assembly algorithms common in the literature, unlocking the simultaneous discovery of metal nodes, linkers and topologies.\n  To help the scientific community build on our work, we release MofasaDB, an annotated library of hundreds of thousands of sampled MOF structures, along with a user-friendly web interface for search and discovery: https://mofux.ai/ .", "AI": {"tldr": "Mofasa\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u539f\u5b50\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u91d1\u5c5e\u6709\u673a\u6846\u67b6\uff08MOFs\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u6837\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u539f\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6676\u683c\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8fbe500\u4e2a\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "MOFs\u662f\u5177\u6709\u5927\u7ec4\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784-\u6027\u80fd\u8026\u5408\u7684\u6709\u5e8f\u53ef\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Mofasa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u624b\u5de5\u7ec4\u88c5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u91d1\u5c5e\u8282\u70b9\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u4f53\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "Mofasa\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u539f\u5b50\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u539f\u5b50\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u539f\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6676\u683c\u5411\u91cf\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8fbe500\u4e2a\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u624b\u5de5\u7ec4\u88c5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u7684MOF\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "Mofasa\u5728MOF\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u8fd8\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86MofasaDB\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u6570\u5341\u4e07\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837MOF\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u754c\u9762\uff08https://mofux.ai/\uff09\u4f9b\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "Mofasa\u586b\u8865\u4e86MOF\u9886\u57df\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u91d1\u5c5e\u6709\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u52a0\u901fMOF\u6750\u6599\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

When used with latent diffusion models, multiplicative LoRA weights enable higher-quality generation than existing weight-space methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6743\u91cd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548cLoRA\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u5728\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e58\u6cd5LoRA\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6743\u91cd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u57282D\u548c3D\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e58\u6cd5LoRA\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u4e58\u6cd5LoRA\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u533a\u5206\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6743\u91cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u548cLoRA\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e58\u6cd5LoRA\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4e3a\u6743\u91cd\u8868\u793a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We focus on the Countdown task (given n numbers and a target, form an expression that evaluates to the target) and analyze model solutions as expression trees, where each subtree corresponds to a reusable subtask and thus can be viewed as a ``skill.'' Tracking tree shapes and their success rates over training, we find: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to larger n and to unseen tree shapes, indicating compositional reuse of subtasks; (ii) a structure-dependent hierarchy of learnability -- models master shallow balanced trees (workload is balanced between subtasks) before deep unbalanced ones, with persistent fragility on right-heavy structures (even when the composition depth is the same as some left-heavy structures).

With RS, achieving high accuracy at small radii requires a small noise variance, while achieving high accuracy at large radii requires a large noise variance. However, the global noise variance used in the standard RS formulation leads to a fundamental limitation: there exists no global noise variance that simultaneously achieves strong performance at both small and large radii. To break through the global variance limitation, we propose a dual RS framework which enables input-dependent noise variances. To achieve that, we first prove that RS remains valid with input-dependent noise variances, provided the variance is locally constant around each input. Building on this result, we introduce two components which form our dual RS framework: (i) a variance estimator first predicts an optimal noise variance for each input, (ii) this estimated variance is then used by a standard RS classifier. The variance estimator is independently smoothed via RS to ensure local constancy, enabling flexible design. We also introduce training strategies to iteratively optimize the two components. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 show that our dual RS method provides strong performance for both small and large radii-unattainable with global noise variance-while incurring only a 60% computational overhead at inference.

Active learning is a well-established framework in machine learning in which the learner selectively queries labels, often achieving substantially higher accuracy and efficiency than classical supervised methods-especially in settings where labeling is costly or time-consuming, such as hiring, admissions, and loan decisions. Strategic classification, however, addresses scenarios where agents modify their features to obtain more favorable outcomes, resulting in observed data that is not truthful. Such manipulation introduces challenges beyond those in learning from clean data. Our goal is to design active and noise-tolerant algorithms that remain effective in strategic environments-algorithms that classify strategic agents accurately while issuing as few label requests as possible. The central difficulty is to simultaneously account for strategic manipulation and preserve the efficiency gains of active learning.\n  Our main result is an algorithm for actively learning linear separators in the strategic setting that preserves the exponential improvement in label complexity over passive learning previously obtained only in the non-strategic case. Specifically, for data drawn uniformly from the unit sphere, we show that a modified version of the Active Perceptron algorithm [DKM05,YZ17] achieves excess error $\u03b5$ using only $\\tilde{O}(d \\ln \\frac{1}\u03b5)$ label queries and incurs at most $\\tilde{O}(d \\ln \\frac{1}\u03b5)$ additional mistakes relative to the optimal classifier, even in the nonrealizable case, when a $\\tilde\u03a9(\u03b5)$ fraction of inputs have inconsistent labels with the optimal classifier. The algorithm is computationally efficient and, under these distributional assumptions, requires substantially fewer label queries than prior work on strategic Perceptron [ABBN21].", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u6218\u7565\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6218\u7565\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6218\u7565\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u4f1a\u64cd\u7eb5\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u5229\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e2\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\u6218\u7565\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08Active Perceptron\uff09\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6218\u7565\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u975e\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6218\u7565\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u65e0\u6218\u7565\u60c5\u51b5\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u4ec5\u9700\u00d5(d ln(1/\u03b5))\u6b21\u6807\u7b7e\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6700\u591a\u4ea7\u751f\u00d5(d ln(1/\u03b5))\u989d\u5916\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u6218\u7565\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u64cd\u7eb5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

This issue arises due to the model's tendency to overwrite previously acquired knowledge with new information. We present a novel approach to address this challenge, focusing on the intersection of memory-based methods and regularization approaches. We formulate a regularization strategy, termed Information Maximization (IM) regularizer, for memory-based continual learning methods, which is based exclusively on the expected label distribution, thus making it class-agnostic. As a consequence, IM regularizer can be directly integrated into various rehearsal-based continual learning methods, reducing forgetting and favoring faster convergence. Our empirical validation shows that, across datasets and regardless of the number of tasks, our proposed regularization strategy consistently improves baseline performance at the expense of a minimal computational overhead. The lightweight nature of IM ensures that it remains a practical and scalable solution, making it applicable to real-world continual learning scenarios where efficiency is paramount. Finally, we demonstrate the data-agnostic nature of our regularizer by applying it to video data, which presents additional challenges due to its temporal structure and higher memory requirements.

We propose a diagnostic framework, grounded in Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, to analyze the underlying strategies resolving this behavior. The framework models generation as a conflict between a 'Compression Pressure' - a drive to minimize overall codebook entropy - and a 'Diversity Pressure' - a drive to maximize conditional entropy given an input. We further decompose this diversity into two primary sources: 'Path Diversity', representing the choice of high-level generative strategies, and 'Execution Diversity', the randomness in executing a chosen strategy. To make this decomposition operational, we introduce three zero-shot, inference-time interventions that directly perturb the latent generative process and reveal how models allocate and express diversity. Application of this probe-based framework to representative AR, MIM, and Diffusion systems reveals three distinct strategies: \"Diversity-Prioritized\" (MIM), \"Compression-Prioritized\" (AR), and \"Decoupled\" (Diffusion).

Epidemiological statistics show a higher prevalence of depression in females, leading models to learn spurious correlations between gender and depression. Consequently, models tend to over-diagnose female patients while underperforming on male patients, raising significant fairness concerns. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Debiasing Framework grounded in causal inference. We construct a causal graph to model the decision-making process and identify gender bias as the direct causal effect of gender on the prediction. During inference, we employ counterfactual inference to estimate and subtract this direct effect, ensuring the model relies primarily on authentic acoustic pathological features.

We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c06Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7c92\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u8fde\u7eed\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u7c7b\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u76f8\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u8fde\u7eed\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u8868\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6761\u4ef6", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u5c06Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7c92\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5Wasserstein\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u3001\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5747\u503c\u6f02\u79fb\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7b49\u89d2\u7ea6\u7b80\u5206\u6790\u805a\u7c7b\u901f\u7387", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u7c7b\u73b0\u8c61\uff1atoken\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e9a\u7a33\u6001\u540e\u6e10\u8fd1\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5e38\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u5bf9\u6536\u7f29\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9a71\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6761\u4ef6", "conclusion": "Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u8fd9\u65e2\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8868\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u4fdd\u6301\u6df1\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6"}}

Current optimization paradigms impose a static compromise on information channel capacity. For instance, magnitude-based methods, such as AdamW, operate on the assumption that gradient norms are high-fidelity curvature signals. While this allows for precision in smooth regimes, it leads to catastrophic noise amplification when applied to rugged, non-convex landscapes. Conversely, sign-based methods (e.g., Lion) perform a radical 1-bit quantization of the gradient, which aims to provide robust regularization at the cost of discarding fine-grained descent information. We propose that optimal convergence requires neither static prior, but rather a dynamic modulation of the update bitrate. We introduce \\textbf{ThermoLion}, a vision-centric framework that utilizes local Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) gating to autonomously transition parameters between a \"low-bit\" exploration phase and a \"high-precision\" exploitation phase. Furthermore, we introduce a Momentum Alignment mechanism that detects constructive interference between historical drift and instantaneous gradients to accelerate convergence during stable trajectories. Empirical benchmarks across 12 diverse vision datasets (including CIFAR, SVHN, and GTSRB) demonstrate that ThermoLion serves as a hyperparameter-free generalist, surpassing both AdamW and Lion in convergence speed and terminal accuracy without architecture-specific tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "ThermoLion\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5229\u7528\u9636\u6bb5\u4e4b\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86AdamW\u548cLion\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9759\u6001\u6298\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982AdamW\uff09\u5728\u5e73\u6ed1\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u4f46\u5728\u5d0e\u5c96\u5730\u5f62\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u566a\u58f0\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Lion\uff09\u901a\u8fc71-bit\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f46\u4e22\u5931\u4e86\u7cbe\u7ec6\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u66f4\u65b0\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faThermoLion\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08SNR\uff09\u95e8\u63a7\u81ea\u4e3b\u5207\u6362\u53c2\u6570\u7684\"\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\"\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\"\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\"\u5229\u7528\u9636\u6bb5\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5386\u53f2\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u77ac\u65f6\u68af\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u5e72\u6270\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ecCIFAR\u3001SVHN\u3001GTSRB\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cThermoLion\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86AdamW\u548cLion\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u9ad8\u7ef4\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u655b\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u66f4\u65b0\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u800c\u975e\u9759\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\u3002ThermoLion\u901a\u8fc7SNR\u95e8\u63a7\u548c\u52a8\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We develop a physics-inspired graph neural network (GNN) surrogate that operates directly on unstructured meshes and leverages the flexibility of graph attention. To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives. Our results demonstrate that graph-based DD, combined with transfer learning, provides a scalable and reliable pathway for training GNN surrogates on massive PDE-governed systems, with broad potential for application beyond ice sheet dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u7684\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u51b0\u76d6\u6a21\u62df\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08PDE\uff09\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u62df\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff08UQ\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6570\u767e\u6216\u6570\u5343\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u5f0fGNN\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e8e\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u57df\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u7f51\u683c\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5b50\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c40\u90e8GNN\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u805a\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b50\u57df\u95f4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u51b0\u76d6\u6a21\u62df\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u5168\u573a\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4e00\u5168\u5c40\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e3aUQ\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u57df\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u5408\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21PDE\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3GNN\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u51b0\u76d6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e4b\u5916\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We evaluate Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), a regularization-based continual learning method, on KG link prediction using TransE embeddings on FB15k-237. Across multiple experiments with five random seeds, we find that EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting from 12.62% to 6.85%, a 45.7% reduction compared to naive sequential training. We observe that the task partitioning strategy affects the magnitude of forgetting: relation-based partitioning (grouping triples by relation type) exhibits 9.8 percentage points higher forgetting than randomly partitioned tasks (12.62% vs 2.81%), suggesting that task construction influences evaluation outcomes.

In SNNs, richer neuronal dynamic allows capturing more complex temporal dependencies, with delays playing a crucial role by allowing past inputs to directly influence present spiking behavior. We propose a general framework for incorporating delays into SNNs through additional state variables. The proposed mechanism enables each neuron to access a finite temporal input history. The framework is agnostic to neuron models and hence can be seamlessly integrated into standard spiking neuron models such as LIF and adLIF. We analyze how the duration of the delays and the learnable parameters associated with them affect the performance. We investigate the trade-offs in the network architecture due to additional state variables introduced by the delay mechanism. Experiments on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset show that the proposed mechanism matches the performance of existing delay-based SNNs while remaining computationally efficient.

However, monitoring the carbon drawdown of ecosystems over large geographic areas remains challenging. Eddy-flux covariance towers provide ground truth for predictive 'upscaling' models derived from satellite products, but many satellites now produce measurements on spatial scales smaller than a flux tower's footprint. We introduce Footprint-Aware Regression (FAR), a first-of-its-kind, deep-learning framework that simultaneously predicts spatial footprints and pixel-level (30 m scale) estimates of carbon flux. FAR is trained on our AMERI-FAR25 dataset which combines 439 site years of tower data with corresponding Landsat scenes. Our model produces high-resolution predictions and achieves R2 = 0.78 when predicting monthly net ecosystem exchange on test sites from a variety of ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFootprint-Aware Regression (FAR)\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u91cf\u5854\u6570\u636e\u548cLandsat\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u572830\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u78b3\u901a\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u8db3\u8ff9\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4f30\u8ba1", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u6c14\u5019\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u8981\u76d1\u6d4b\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u78b3\u5438\u6536\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u536b\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c0f\u4e8e\u901a\u91cf\u5854\u8db3\u8ff9\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u78b3\u901a\u91cf", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1FAR\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528AMERI-FAR25\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08439\u7ad9\u70b9\u5e74\u7684\u901a\u91cf\u5854\u6570\u636e\u4e0eLandsat\u5f71\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u8db3\u8ff9\u548c30\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u78b3\u901a\u91cf", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ad9\u70b9\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u6708\u51c0\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea4\u6362\u7684R\u00b2\u8fbe\u52300.78", "conclusion": "FAR\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u78b3\u901a\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u8db3\u8ff9\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u78b3\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

Specifically, we show that SVRG is recovered as a special case of posterior correction over the isotropic-Gaussian family, while novel extensions are automatically obtained by using more flexible exponential families. We derive two new SVRG variants by using Gaussian families: First, a Newton-like variant that employs novel Hessian corrections, and second, an Adam-like extension that improves pretraining and finetuning of Transformer language models.

While instructions serve as the primary protocol for defining agents, RLVR typically relies on static and manually designed instructions. However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce INSPO, a novel Instruction-Policy co-evolution framework that integrates instruction optimization as a dynamic component of the reinforcement learning (RL) loop. INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned. New instructions are generated and verified through an on-policy reflection mechanism, where an LLM-based optimizer analyzes past experience from a replay buffer and evolves more effective strategies given the current policy. We conduct extensive experiments on multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks, demonstrating that INSPO substantially outperforms strong baselines relying on static instructions. INSPO discovers innovative instructions that guide the agent toward more strategic reasoning paths, achieving substantial performance gains with only a marginal increase in computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "INSPO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6307\u4ee4-\u7b56\u7565\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u6307\u4ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\uff08\u5e26\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u3001\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u4ee4\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u4ee3\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u6307\u4ee4\u4e5f\u4f1a\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u4ee4\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "INSPO\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6307\u4ee4\u4f18\u5316\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u7ef4\u62a4\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u4ee4\u5019\u9009\u6c60\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06RL\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u6bcf\u6761\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b2\uff09\u5b9a\u671f\u4fee\u526a\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b0\u6307\u4ee4\uff0cLLM\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5206\u6790\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u5316\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cINSPO\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002INSPO\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u4ee3\u7406\u8d70\u5411\u66f4\u5177\u6218\u7565\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ee5\u8fb9\u9645\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "INSPO\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4-\u7b56\u7565\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u6307\u4ee4\u5728RLVR\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u4ee4\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

While individual optimization techniques like KV cache quantization, chunked prefill, and model weight quantization have shown promise, their joint effects and optimal configurations for edge deployment remain underexplored. We introduce KV Pareto, a systems-level framework that systematically maps the trade-off frontier between total memory consumption and task accuracy across these three complementary optimization techniques. Our framework evaluates multiple LLM architectures (Qwen, Llama, Mistral) with varying KV quantization schemes (int2/4/8, mixed-precision), granularities (per-token, per-tensor, per-block), and 4-bit weight quantization via AWQ. Our framework identifies model-specific Pareto-optimal configurations that achieve 68-78% total memory reduction with minimal (1-3%) accuracy degradation on long-context tasks. We additionally verify the selected frontiers on additional benchmarks of Needle-in-a-Haystack, GSM8k and MMLU as well as extended context lengths of up to 128k to demonstrate the practical need of joint optimization for efficient LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "KV Pareto\u6846\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63a2\u7d22KV\u7f13\u5b58\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u5206\u5757\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u4e09\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LLM\u63a8\u7406\u627e\u5230\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b068-78%\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u4ec51-3%\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9762\u4e34KV\u7f13\u5b58\u968f\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709KV\u7f13\u5b58\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u5206\u5757\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u7b49\u5355\u72ec\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6548\u679c\u548c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKV Pareto\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6620\u5c04\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u8fb9\u754c\uff1a1) KV\u7f13\u5b58\u91cf\u5316\uff08int2/4/8\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\uff09\uff1b2) \u5206\u5757\u9884\u586b\u5145\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7AWQ\u76844\u4f4d\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cdLLM\u67b6\u6784\uff08Qwen\u3001Llama\u3001Mistral\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b068-78%\u7684\u603b\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u4ec5\u4e3a1-3%\u3002\u5728Needle-in-a-Haystack\u3001GSM8k\u548cMMLU\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u6269\u5c55\u5230128k\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u9009\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0cKV Pareto\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LLM\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

In this setting, decomposition acts as a \"surgical\" intervention, followed by fine-tuning that serves as \"rehab\" to recover accuracy. Inspired by prehabilitation in surgery, we introduce a pre-compression fine-tuning stage, Low-Rank Prehab, that explicitly encourages low-rank structure in weight matrices while preserving task performance. By conditioning the model before SVD, Prehab steers weights toward spectrally compact regions of the parameter space, enabling smoother low-rank approximation and improved recovery. Experiments on large language models (LLMs) and other Transformer-based architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), show that Prehab substantially reduces the immediate accuracy drop after compression and consistently improves post-finetuning performance. Across a wide range of compression ratios, our method outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based techniques such as SVD-LLM, highlighting the importance of preparing models for compression rather than only improving the compression and recovery stages.

However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines.

While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can decompose hidden activations into more fine-grained, interpretable features, they often struggle to reliably align these features with human-defined concepts, resulting in entangled and distributed feature representations. To address this, we introduce AlignSAE, a method that aligns SAE features with a defined ontology through a \"pre-train, then post-train\" curriculum. After an initial unsupervised training phase, we apply supervised post-training to bind specific concepts to dedicated latent slots while preserving the remaining capacity for general reconstruction. This separation creates an interpretable interface where specific relations can be inspected and controlled without interference from unrelated features. Empirical results demonstrate that AlignSAE enables precise causal interventions, such as reliable \"concept swaps\", by targeting single, semantically aligned slots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAlignSAE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\"\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3+\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\"\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\"\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3+\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\"\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5c06\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5230\u4e13\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u69fd\u4f4d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u822c\u91cd\u6784\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAlignSAE\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5982\u53ef\u9760\u7684\"\u6982\u5ff5\u4ea4\u6362\"\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u69fd\u4f4d\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u53d7\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "AlignSAE\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u672c\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
