### [1] [A Masked Representation Learning to Model Cardiac Functions Using Multiple Physiological Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08830)
*Seong-A Park,Jong-Eui Chae,Sungdong Kim,Hyung-Chul Lee,Hyun-Lim Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: SNUPHY-M模型通过自监督学习同时分析ECG、PPG和ABP三种生理信号，提取心脏周期的电学、压力和液体特征，在血流动力学监测任务中显著优于监督学习和其他自监督模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床环境中需要综合分析多种生理信号来监测血流动力学，但现有研究多集中于单一信号分析，缺乏适用于真实临床场景的复杂信号分析方法。

Method: 基于自监督学习的掩码表示学习方法，通过恢复三种被掩码的生理信号（ECG、PPG、ABP）来提取反映心脏周期多种物理特征的生理特征。

Result: 在低血压、每搏输出量、收缩压、舒张压和年龄预测等临床下游任务中，SNUPHY-M显著优于监督学习或自监督学习模型，特别是在使用无创信号的预测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SNUPHY-M是首个将多模态自监督学习应用于心血管分析（涉及ECG、PPG和ABP信号）的模型，有效支持临床决策，实现精确诊断，对无创早期诊断和血流动力学管理有重要贡献。

Abstract: In clinical settings, monitoring hemodynamics is crucial for managing patient
prognosis, necessitating the integrated analysis of multiple physiological
signals. While recent research has analyzed single signals such as
electrocardiography (ECG) or photoplethysmography (PPG), there has yet to be a
proposal for an approach that encompasses the complex signal analysis required
in actual clinical scenarios. In this study, we introduce the SNUPHY-M (Seoul
National University hospital PHYsiological signal Masked representation
learning) model extracts physiological features reflecting the electrical,
pressure, and fluid characteristics of the cardiac cycle in the process of
restoring three masked physiological signals based on self-supervised learning
(SSL): ECG, PPG, and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. By employing
multiple physical characteristics, the model can extract more enriched features
only using non-invasive signals. We evaluated the model's performance in
clinical downstream tasks such as hypotension, stroke volume, systolic blood
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and age prediction. Our results showed that
the SNUPHY-M significantly outperformed supervised or SSL models, especially in
prediction tasks using non-invasive signals. To the best of our knowledge,
SNUPHY-M is the first model to apply multi-modal SSL to cardiovascular analysis
involving ECG, PPG, and ABP signals. This approach effectively supports
clinical decision-making and enables precise diagnostics, contributing
significantly to the early diagnosis and management of hemodynamics without
invasiveness.

TL;DR: 本文探讨AI在教育领域的应用，特别是信号处理教育，重点关注技术局限性和实际应用，旨在促进公平、负责任的AI使用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI技术虽取得重大突破，但如何公平、负责任地使用AI来改善全球人类状况仍面临挑战，特别是在教育领域

Method: 提供关于AI在教育环境中使用的核心技术问题入门指南，包括公平性、包容性、处理幻觉输出和资源高效利用，并通过开发沉浸式、结构化、可靠的"智能教科书"进行说明

Conclusion: AI在教育领域具有巨大潜力，但需要解决公平性、透明度、可解释性和可信度等问题，智能教科书是其中一个有前景的应用方向

Abstract: Powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools that have emerged in recent years
-- including large language models, automated coding assistants, and advanced
image and speech generation technologies -- are the result of monumental human
achievements. These breakthroughs reflect mastery across multiple technical
disciplines and the resolution of significant technological challenges.
However, some of the most profound challenges may still lie ahead. These
challenges are not purely technical but pertain to the fair and responsible use
of AI in ways that genuinely improve the global human condition. This article
explores one promising application aligned with that vision: the use of AI
tools to facilitate and enhance education, with a specific focus on signal
processing (SP). It presents two interrelated perspectives: identifying and
addressing technical limitations, and applying AI tools in practice to improve
educational experiences. Primers are provided on several core technical issues
that arise when using AI in educational settings, including how to ensure
fairness and inclusivity, handle hallucinated outputs, and achieve efficient
use of resources. These and other considerations -- such as transparency,
explainability, and trustworthiness -- are illustrated through the development
of an immersive, structured, and reliable "smart textbook." The article serves
as a resource for researchers and educators seeking to advance AI's role in
engineering education.

### [3] [Ultrafast Deep Learning-Based Scatter Estimation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08973)
*Harshit Agrawal,Ari Hietanen,Simo Särkkä*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究通过在不同分辨率下应用网络并选择最优方案，显著降低了锥束CT散射校正的深度学习模型计算量和内存需求，实现了78倍FLOPs减少和16倍推理速度提升，同时保持可比性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决锥束CT扫描中散射伪影严重影响图像质量的问题，现有深度学习方法因网络内存占用大而难以在移动CBCT系统或边缘设备上部署。

Method: 首先在六个分辨率下比较四种插值方法的CBCT散射信号重建误差，然后在五个图像分辨率上训练最新SOTA方法，评估FLOPs、推理时间和GPU内存需求的减少。

Result: 输入尺寸和网络参数的减少实现了78倍FLOPs降低，MAPE从4.42%降至3.85%，MSE从2.01×10⁻²降至1.34×10⁻²，推理时间和GPU内存使用分别减少16倍和12倍。

Conclusion: 研究强调了降采样在深度学习散射估计中被低估的作用，大幅降低的计算资源需求使得在移动CBCT和边缘设备等资源受限环境中进行散射校正成为可能。

Abstract: Purpose: Scatter artifacts drastically degrade the image quality of cone-beam
computed tomography (CBCT) scans. Although deep learning-based methods show
promise in estimating scatter from CBCT measurements, their deployment in
mobile CBCT systems or edge devices is still limited due to the large memory
footprint of the networks. This study addresses the issue by applying networks
at varying resolutions and suggesting an optimal one, based on speed and
accuracy.
  Methods: First, the reconstruction error in down-up sampling of CBCT scatter
signal was examined at six resolutions by comparing four interpolation methods.
Next, a recent state-of-the-art method was trained across five image
resolutions and evaluated for the reductions in floating-point operations
(FLOPs), inference times, and GPU memory requirements.
  Results: Reducing the input size and network parameters achieved a 78-fold
reduction in FLOPs compared to the baseline method, while maintaining comarable
performance in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE) and
mean-square-error (MSE). Specifically, the MAPE decreased to 3.85% compared to
4.42%, and the MSE decreased to 1.34 \times 10^{-2} compared to 2.01 \times
10^{-2}. Inference time and GPU memory usage were reduced by factors of 16 and
12, respectively. Further experiments comparing scatter-corrected
reconstructions on a large, simulated dataset and real CBCT scans from water
and Sedentex CT phantoms clearly demonstrated the robustness of our method.
  Conclusion: This study highlights the underappreciated role of downsampling
in deep learning-based scatter estimation. The substantial reduction in FLOPs
and GPU memory requirements achieved by our method enables scatter correction
in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile CBCT and edge devices.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 6G网络设计需要将韧性作为核心目标，与可持续性和效率并重，通过技术、架构和经济三个维度构建能够应对长期复杂中断的弹性系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动网络从效率优先转向可持续性导向，需要应对复杂中断和级联故障，确保关键基础设施的持续运行。

Method: 采用3R框架（可靠性、鲁棒性、韧性），提出边缘原生架构、开放接口、可编程性，结合AI原生控制、零信任安全和流量优先级技术。

Result: 建立了包含优雅降级、态势感知、快速重构和学习驱动恢复的量化能力体系，提出了9种商业模式组和治理标准框架。

Conclusion: 韧性是6G网络的关键设计原则，需要跨技术、架构和经济层面的综合解决方案，为研究人员和决策者提供了6G韧性发展的基础框架。

Abstract: 6G must be designed to withstand, adapt to, and evolve amid prolonged,
complex disruptions. Mobile networks' shift from efficiency-first to
sustainability-aware has motivated this white paper to assert that resilience
is a primary design goal, alongside sustainability and efficiency, encompassing
technology, architecture, and economics. We promote resilience by analysing
dependencies between mobile networks and other critical systems, such as
energy, transport, and emergency services, and illustrate how cascading
failures spread through infrastructures. We formalise resilience using the 3R
framework: reliability, robustness, resilience. Subsequently, we translate this
into measurable capabilities: graceful degradation, situational awareness,
rapid reconfiguration, and learning-driven improvement and recovery.
  Architecturally, we promote edge-native and locality-aware designs, open
interfaces, and programmability to enable islanded operations, fallback modes,
and multi-layer diversity (radio, compute, energy, timing). Key enablers
include AI-native control loops with verifiable behaviour, zero-trust security
rooted in hardware and supply-chain integrity, and networking techniques that
prioritise critical traffic, time-sensitive flows, and inter-domain
coordination.
  Resilience also has a techno-economic aspect: open platforms and high-quality
complementors generate ecosystem externalities that enhance resilience while
opening new markets. We identify nine business-model groups and several
patterns aligned with the 3R objectives, and we outline governance and
standardisation. This white paper serves as an initial step and catalyst for 6G
resilience. It aims to inspire researchers, professionals, government
officials, and the public, providing them with the essential components to
understand and shape the development of 6G resilience.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出AdaST-Sleep自适应时空模型，结合CNN和RNN处理多特征空间交互和长期时序健康数据，通过域分类器实现跨用户泛化，在睡眠评分预测任务中优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠预测可以帮助个人和医疗提供者预见并主动应对影响良好休息的因素，从而改善身心健康。需要开发能够处理商业可穿戴设备稀疏数据的个性化睡眠预测解决方案。

Method: 提出AdaST-Sleep模型，使用卷积层捕获多特征间的空间特征交互，循环神经网络层处理长期时序健康数据，集成域分类器实现跨不同受试者的泛化。使用5种输入窗口大小(3-11天)和5种预测窗口大小(1-9天)进行实验。

Result: 模型在7天输入窗口和1天预测窗口时获得最低RMSE(0.282)，始终优于4个基线模型。即使预测多天未来也能保持强劲性能，可视化比较显示模型能准确跟踪总体睡眠评分水平和日常波动。

Conclusion: 该框架为使用商业可穿戴设备稀疏数据和域适应技术进行个性化睡眠预测提供了稳健且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: A sleep forecast allows individuals and healthcare providers to anticipate
and proactively address factors influencing restful rest, ultimately improving
mental and physical well-being. This work presents an adaptive spatial and
temporal model (AdaST-Sleep) for predicting sleep scores. Our proposed model
combines convolutional layers to capture spatial feature interactions between
multiple features and recurrent neural network layers to handle longer-term
temporal health-related data. A domain classifier is further integrated to
generalize across different subjects. We conducted several experiments using
five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, 11 days) and five predicting window sizes
(1, 3, 5, 7, 9 days). Our approach consistently outperformed four baseline
models, achieving its lowest RMSE (0.282) with a seven-day input window and a
one-day predicting window. Moreover, the method maintained strong performance
even when forecasting multiple days into the future, demonstrating its
versatility for real-world applications. Visual comparisons reveal that the
model accurately tracks both the overall sleep score level and daily
fluctuations. These findings prove that the proposed framework provides a
robust and adaptable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse
data from commercial wearable devices and domain adaptation techniques.

### [6] [Improving the Elevational Focusing of Fast Orthogonal Row-Column Electronic Scanning (FORCES) Ultrasound Imaging using Retrospective Transmit Beamforming (RTB)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09056)
*Michael Caulfield,Randy Palamar,Darren Dahunsi,Mohammad Rahim Sobhani,Negar Majidi,Roger Zemp*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种改进的FORCES成像方案，通过应用回顾性发射波束成形(RTB)技术来提升行-列阵列(RCA)在高度方向的聚焦性能，解决了传统FORCES方法在焦平面外高度聚焦效果差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FORCES成像方案由于固定的高度聚焦和大发射孔径，在焦平面外的高度聚焦效果较差，限制了行-列阵列在容积成像中的应用效果。

Method: 在FORCES和uFORCES成像方案中应用回顾性发射波束成形(RTB)技术，通过在高度方向进行发射聚焦处理，实现对成像平面内任意位置的高度聚焦。

Result: 实验结果显示，应用RTB后FORCES和uFORCES在焦平面外的高度聚焦能力显著改善，在焦点处性能保持相当或有所提升，通过线靶和囊肿体模成像验证了改进效果。

Conclusion: RTB技术的应用有效提升了行-列阵列成像系统的高度聚焦性能，为容积超声成像提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent developments in Row Column Arrays (RCAs) have presented promising
options for volumetric imaging without the need for the excessive channel
counts of fully wired 2D-arrays. Bias programmable RCAs, also known as Top
Orthogonal to Bottom Electrode (TOBE) Arrays, show further promise in that
imaging schemes, such as Fast Orthogonal Row-Column Electronic Scanning
(FORCES) allow for full transmit and receive focusing everywhere in the image
plane. However, due to its fixed elevational focus and large transmit aperture,
FORCES experiences poor elevational focusing away from the focal point. In this
study we present a modification to the FORCES imaging scheme by applying
Retrospective Transmit Beamforming (RTB) in the elevational direction to allow
for elevational transmit focusing everywhere in the imaging plane. We evaluate
FORCES and uFORCES methods, with and without RTB applied, when imaging both a
cyst and wire phantom. With experiment we show improved elevational focusing
capabilities away from the focal point when RTB is applied to both FORCES and
uFORCES. At the focal point, performance with RTB remains comparable or
improved relative to standard FORCES. This is quantified by the measurement of
Full Width Half Max when imaging the wire phantom, and by the generalized
Contrast to Noise Ratio when imaging the tubular cyst phantom. We also
demonstrate the volumetric imaging capabilities of FORCES RTB with the wire
phantom.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对带隐藏节点的符号图学习方法SGL-HNCS，通过列稀疏正则化解决部分节点不可观测的符号图识别问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号图学习方法通常假设所有节点都可用，但在实际应用中往往只有部分节点可观测，其余节点保持隐藏状态，需要解决这一挑战

Method: 基于符号图信号平滑性假设，将符号图拓扑推断建模为带列稀疏正则化的约束优化问题，使用定制的块坐标下降(BCD)方法求解

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据上的实验结果表明所提出的SGL-HNCS方法具有高效性

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理存在隐藏节点的符号图学习问题，为符号图信号处理领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Signed graphs, which are characterized by both positive and negative edge
weights, have recently attracted significant attention in the field of graph
signal processing (GSP). Existing works on signed graph learning typically
assume that all graph nodes are available. However, in some specific
applications, only a subset of nodes can be observed while the remaining nodes
stay hidden. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method for
identifying signed graph that accounts for hidden nodes, termed \textit{signed
graph learning with hidden nodes under column-sparsity regularization}
(SGL-HNCS). Our method is based on the assumption that graph signals are smooth
over signed graphs, i.e., signal values of two nodes connected by positive
(negative) edges are similar (dissimilar). Rooted in this prior assumption, the
topology inference of a signed graph is formulated as a constrained
optimization problem with column-sparsity regularization, where the goal is to
reconstruct the signed graph Laplacian matrix without disregarding the
influence of hidden nodes. We solve the constrained optimization problem using
a tailored block coordinate descent (BCD) approach. Experimental results using
synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
SGL-HNCS method.

### [8] [Sequential Spectral Clustering of Data Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09144)
*G Dhinesh Chandran,Kota Srinivas Reddy,Srikrishna Bhashyam*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种序列谱聚类算法（SEQ-SPEC和IA-SEQ-SPEC），用于数据序列的非参数聚类，在有限样本下实现指数级一致性，性能优于传统固定样本方法和序列K-Medoids/SLINK算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据序列的非参数聚类问题，其中每个序列包含来自未知分布的i.i.d.样本。由于真实分布未知，需要在给定错误概率下通过观察最少样本量来估计聚类。

Method: 提出SEQ-SPEC算法和计算效率更高的IA-SEQ-SPEC算法，采用序列框架进行谱聚类，确保算法在有限时间内停止且具有指数一致性。

Result: 模拟实验显示两种算法性能均优于固定样本SPEC、序列K-Medoids和序列SLINK算法。IA-SEQ-SPEC在保持计算效率的同时，性能接近SEQ-SPEC。

Conclusion: 这是首个在序列框架下进行数据序列谱聚类的工作，提出的算法在合成和真实数据集上都表现出色，为序列聚类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of nonparametric clustering of data sequences, where
each data sequence comprises i.i.d. samples generated from an unknown
distribution. The true clusters are the clusters obtained using the Spectral
clustering algorithm (SPEC) on the pairwise distance between the true
distributions corresponding to the data sequences. Since the true distributions
are unknown, the objective is to estimate the clusters by observing the minimum
number of samples from the data sequences for a given error probability. To
solve this problem, we propose the Sequential Spectral clustering algorithm
(SEQ-SPEC), and show that it stops in finite time almost surely and is
exponentially consistent. We also propose a computationally more efficient
algorithm called the Incremental Approximate Sequential Spectral clustering
algorithm (IA-SEQ-SPEC). Through simulations, we show that both our proposed
algorithms perform better than the fixed sample size SPEC, the Sequential
$K$-Medoids clustering algorithm (SEQ-KMED) and the Sequential Single Linkage
clustering algorithm (SEQ-SLINK). The IA-SEQ-SPEC, while being computationally
efficient, performs close to SEQ-SPEC on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on spectral
clustering of data sequences under a sequential framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据-模型协同驱动的去噪方法JFRFFNet，将联合时-顶点分数傅里叶变换域的维纳滤波模型嵌入神经网络，通过数据驱动方式更新变换阶数对和滤波器系数，仅需部分先验信息即可实现有效去噪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统滤波方法需要完整的图信号先验信息，无论是使用网格搜索确定变换阶数对的传统方法还是使用梯度下降优化的可学习方法都存在这一局限性。

Method: 将JFRFT域维纳滤波模型嵌入神经网络架构，通过数据驱动方式联合优化变换阶数对和滤波器系数，仅需部分先验信息。

Result: 实验表明JFRFFNet在输出信噪比方面相比现有最先进方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的数据-模型协同驱动方法成功克服了传统方法需要完整先验信息的限制，实现了更有效的时变图信号去噪。

Abstract: Wiener filtering in the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform
(JFRFT) domain has shown high effectiveness in denoising time-varying graph
signals. Traditional filtering models use grid search to determine the
transform-order pair and compute filter coefficients, while learnable ones
employ gradient-descent strategies to optimize them; both require complete
prior information of graph signals. To overcome this shortcoming, this letter
proposes a data-model co-driven denoising approach, termed neural-network-aided
joint time-vertex fractional Fourier filtering (JFRFFNet), which embeds the
JFRFT-domain Wiener filter model into a neural network and updates the
transform-order pair and filter coefficients through a data-driven approach.
This design enables effective denoising using only partial prior information.
Experiments demonstrate that JFRFFNet achieves significant improvements in
output signal-to-noise ratio compared with some state-of-the-art methods.

### [10] [On Sampling of Multiple Correlated Stochastic Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09225)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用多通道信号统计相关性的高效采样方法，通过建模为少量不相关潜在源的线性组合，建立了零均方误差重建的理论采样密度下界，并开发了达到该下界的多频带采样方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统采样方法独立处理每个通道导致数据冗余，多随机信号存在固有统计相关性，需要利用这种相关性来提高采样效率。

Method: 将相关通道建模为少量不相关宽平稳潜在源的线性组合，通过潜在源的频谱分割，然后进行时空采样和插值，构建多频带采样方案。

Result: 实验证明该方案在理论采样密度下实现了近乎无损的重建，验证了其效率。

Conclusion: 提出的多频带采样方案能够有效利用信号相关性，达到理论最优采样效率，为多通道信号处理提供了高效采样框架。

Abstract: Multiple stochastic signals possess inherent statistical correlations, yet
conventional sampling methods that process each channel independently result in
data redundancy. To leverage this correlation for efficient sampling, we model
correlated channels as a linear combination of a smaller set of uncorrelated,
wide-sense stationary latent sources. We establish a theoretical lower bound on
the total sampling density for zero mean-square error reconstruction, proving
it equals the ratio of the joint spectral bandwidth of latent sources to the
number of correlated signal channels. We then develop a constructive multi-band
sampling scheme that attains this bound. The proposed method operates via
spectral partitioning of the latent sources, followed by spatio-temporal
sampling and interpolation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm
that our scheme achieves near-lossless reconstruction precisely at the
theoretical sampling density, validating its efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号中的伪迹会严重影响数据质量，现有方法依赖人工参数调优、对异常值敏感且计算成本高，需要自动化高效的解决方案

Method: 改进的黎曼土豆场(iRPF)方法，基于黎曼几何的快速全自动EEG伪迹去除技术

Result: 在226个EEG记录上测试，iRPF相比其他方法在召回率提升22%，特异性提升102%，精确度提升54%，F1分数提升24%，处理速度达8毫秒/epoch

Conclusion: iRPF为脑机接口和临床神经影像应用提供了强大、数据驱动的EEG预处理解决方案，适用于大规模数据处理和实时应用

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signal cleaning has long been a critical
challenge in the research community. The presence of artifacts can
significantly degrade EEG data quality, complicating analysis and potentially
leading to erroneous interpretations. While various artifact rejection methods
have been proposed, the gold standard remains manual visual inspection by human
experts-a process that is time-consuming, subjective, and impractical for
large-scale EEG studies. Existing techniques are often hindered by a strong
reliance on manual hyperparameter tuning, sensitivity to outliers, and high
computational costs. In this paper, we introduce the improved Riemannian Potato
Field (iRPF), a fast and fully automated method for EEG artifact rejection that
addresses key limitations of current approaches. We evaluate iRPF against
several state-of-the-art artifact rejection methods, using two publicly
available EEG databases, labeled for various artifact types, comprising 226 EEG
recordings. Our results demonstrate that iRPF outperforms all competitors
across multiple metrics, with gains of up to 22% in recall, 102% in
specificity, 54% in precision, and 24% in F1-score, compared to Isolation
Forest, Autoreject, Riemannian Potato, and Riemannian Potato Field,
respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these
improvements (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8) in most
comparisons. Additionally, on a typical EEG recording iRPF performs artifact
cleaning in under 8 milliseconds per epoch using a standard laptop,
highlighting its efficiency for large-scale EEG data processing and real-time
applications. iRPF offers a robust and data-driven artifact rejection solution
for high-quality EEG pre-processing in brain-computer interfaces and clinical
neuroimaging applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决不同导电结构散射分析时缺乏统一基准的问题，希望通过一个共同的特征模式基础来分析和比较不同结构，特别是在天线设计过程中逐步修改结构时的分析需求。

Method: 推导了基于超集结构特征模式的散射分析形式化方法，定义了模态变换矩阵来描述特征场与加权系数之间的映射关系，实现了不同基底下扰动矩阵的转换。

Result: 建立了散射矩阵和扰动矩阵在非对角情况下的分析框架，通过两个示例验证了形式化方法的有效性，展示了该方法在天线设计过程中的应用价值。

Conclusion: 该方法为不同结构的散射分析提供了统一的特征模式基础，特别适用于渐进式修改的天线设计过程，具有重要的理论和应用价值。

Abstract: A formalism is derived to analyze the scattering of a conducting structure
based on the characteristic modes of another structure whose surface is a
superset of the first structure. This enables the analysis and comparison of
different structures using a common basis of characteristic modes.
Additionally, it is shown that the scattering matrices and perturbation
matrices are no longer diagonal in these cases. Based on this, a modal
transformation matrix is defined to describe the mapping between the
characteristic fields and the weighting coefficients of the two structures.
This matrix enables the conversion of the perturbation matrices in different
bases. Finally, two examples are provided along with a discussion of some
aspects of the theory. The first example aims to validate and illustrate the
formalism. The second example shows how the formalism can be applied in the
design process of an antenna element that is gradually modified, starting from
a base structure.

radiation pattern switching than traditional designs. However, this innovation
introduces challenges for channel estimation and analog precoding due to the
state-non-separable channel response problem. This paper explores a multiuser
MIMO-OFDM system utilizing pixel-based fluid antennas, informed by measurements
from a real-world prototype. We present a sparse channel recovery framework for
uplink channel sounding, employing an approximate separable channel response
model with DNN-based antenna radiation functions. We then propose two
low-complexity channel estimation algorithms that leverage orthogonal matching
pursuit and variational Bayesian inference to accurately recover channel
responses across various scattering cluster angles. These estimations enable
the prediction of composite channels for all fluid antenna states, leading to
an analog precoding scheme that optimally selects switching states for
different antennas. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed approach
significantly outperforms several baseline methods, especially in high
signal-to-noise ratio environments with numerous users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习在路径损耗预测中泛化能力不足、对噪声输入鲁棒性差以及对无人机高度敏感等问题

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了路径损耗预测的关键挑战，代码已公开以支持可重复性和未来研究

Abstract: Accurate pathloss prediction is essential for the design and optimization of
UAV-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks. While deep learning approaches
have shown strong potential, their generalization across diverse environments,
robustness to noisy inputs, and sensitivity to UAV altitude remain
underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose a UNet-based deep
learning architecture that combines multi-scale feature extraction,
convolution-based feature fusion, and an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP)
bottleneck for efficient context aggregation. The model predicts pathloss maps
from log-distance, line-of-sight (LOS) mask, and building mask inputs. In
addition, we develop a fully vectorized LOS mask computation algorithm that
significantly accelerates pre-processing and enables large-scale dataset
generation. Extensive evaluations on both in-house ray-tracing data and the
RadioMapSeer benchmark demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms several
state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and efficiency. All source code is
publicly released to support reproducibility and future research.

### [15] [Corruption-Tolerant Asynchronous Q-Learning with Near-Optimal Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08933)
*Sreejeet Maity,Aritra Mitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对对抗性奖励腐败的鲁棒Q学习算法，在异步采样模型下证明了有限时间收敛性，收敛率与非对抗情况相近，仅增加与腐败样本比例成正比的附加项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法如Q-learning在面对奖励信号被对抗性腐败（极端噪声、传感器故障或恶意攻击）时性能会严重下降，需要开发能够有效处理腐败奖励的鲁棒算法。

Method: 提出了一种新的可证明鲁棒的Q-learning变体算法，能够在部分观测奖励被对手任意扰动的情况下有效运行。还提出了一个无需先验了解真实奖励分布统计信息的算法变体，利用了精炼的Azuma-Hoeffding不等式技术。

Result: 在异步采样模型下，即使存在对抗性腐败，算法的有限时间收敛率与非对抗情况下的现有结果匹配，仅增加与腐败样本比例成正比的附加项。信息论下界表明这个附加腐败项是不可避免的。

Conclusion: 这项工作为异步Q-learning提供了首个有限时间鲁棒性保证，填补了鲁棒强化学习领域的重要空白，所提出的技术工具可能具有独立的研究价值。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,
infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is
subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from
extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the
performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this
challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm
that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are
arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model
with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,
the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing
results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to
the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is
unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge
of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this
setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a
refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool
that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide
the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning,
bridging a significant gap in robust RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估神经网络样本级不确定性量化对高风险应用决策至关重要，但传统加性分解方法受到质疑，需要更直观的不确定性分解框架

Method: 基于类别概率分布在不同模型预测间的信噪比，引入方差门控度量，通过集成模型推导置信因子来缩放预测

Result: 提出了新的不确定性估计框架，能够有效分解预测不确定性，并揭示了委员会机器可能存在多样性崩溃现象

Conclusion: 该框架为不确定性量化提供了更直观的方法，方差门控机制有助于提升预测可靠性，对高风险应用中的决策支持具有重要意义

Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is
essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common
approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation
models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic
(model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive
decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an
intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the
signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model
predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a
confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the
existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了矩阵学习专家建议问题的改进算法，通过新的势函数和单边Jensen迹不等式，实现了比经典MMWU算法更优的实例最优遗憾界，且计算复杂度相同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典MMWU算法在矩阵版本的学习专家建议问题中只能达到最小最大最优遗憾界，但无法实现实例最优性能。本文旨在开发一个既能保持相同计算复杂度又能获得更好遗憾界的算法。

Method: 开发了基于势函数的矩阵LEA通用框架，使用拉普拉斯变换技术构建新的单边Jensen迹不等式，并采用基于虚误差函数的最优势函数来设计算法。

Result: 新算法实现了O(√(T·S(X||d⁻¹I_d)))的实例最优遗憾界，相比经典O(√(T log d))有显著改进，且计算复杂度与MMWU相同。在量子态学习等多个应用中表现出优于现有技术的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为矩阵在线学习提供了理论突破，证明了在不增加计算成本的情况下可以获得更好的遗憾界，并在量子学习理论中展示了广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning
algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the
Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,
it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present
an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,
$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum
relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational
complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is
``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix
LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential
potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace
inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application
of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm
is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA
problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and
explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show
that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted
by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition,
applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear
quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$
correlation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRIDE是一个可扩展的XAI框架，通过RKHS中的正交函数分解避免特征子集枚举，提供功能性解释而非单一标量归因，在保持高保真度的同时实现显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有XAI框架的两个主要限制：特征子集推理的指数级计算成本和将解释效果简化为单一标量值的表达能力不足问题。

Method: 在再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)中通过递归核中心化程序进行解析投影，计算函数分量f_S(x_S)，避免显式子集枚举，实现正交函数分解。

Result: 在10个数据集上实现中位数约3倍的加速(0.6-9.7倍范围)，保持高保真度(R^2在0.81-0.999之间)，并在大多数数据集上具有显著的排名一致性。

Conclusion: STRIDE通过提供结构化函数视角补充了标量归因方法，支持新颖的诊断功能如'组件手术'来量化特定交互作用的影响。

Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact
of specific interactions within our experimental scope.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在多源异构数据中容易学习到伪相关，在非典型或代表性不足群体上性能下降。现有最差群体优化方法假设群体分布可准确估计，但在噪声、非平稳和动态环境中这一假设常被违反

Method: 使用Wasserstein距离的分布鲁棒优化(DRO)框架，同时考虑每个群体内的分布不确定性并优化最差群体性能。开发了梯度下降-上升算法求解DRO问题

Result: 提供了算法收敛性证明，并在真实世界数据上验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效处理群体分布不确定性，在噪声和非平稳环境中提升最差群体性能

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models critically depends on the
quality and representativeness of the training data. In applications with
multiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn
spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for
atypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by
optimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically
assume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately
estimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in
noisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each
group, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the
worst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to
solve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities,
yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit
current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a
foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a
dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation,
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal
dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first
distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the
Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction
Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across
multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal
classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease
detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy,
as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides
risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion,
FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable
solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic
precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code
after acceptance.

Motivation: 分析LRP型归因方法的数值特性，建立其与雅可比矩阵链式法则的类比关系，研究归因值的分布特性及其在数据增强和Smoothgrad型方法中的收敛行为。

Method: 将LRP归因方法表示为修正梯度矩阵的乘积形式，推导奇异值上界和分量界限，应用这些界限获得控制经验均值收敛的乘性常数。

Result: 获得了控制归因图期望值收敛的乘性常数，发现LRP-beta方法的常数独立于权重范数，这与基于梯度的方法和LRP-epsilon形成显著区别。

Conclusion: 该分析对多数据增强场景和Smoothgrad型方法有重要影响，揭示了LRP-beta在数值稳定性方面的优势，为归因方法的选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

Conclusion: 碳感知调度策略能有效减少联邦学习的碳排放，同时保持模型准确性，为绿色机器学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Training large-scale machine learning models incurs substantial carbon
emissions. Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across
geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage
regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper
investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client
selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a
carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest
extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training
rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of
such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,
selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To
leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that
integrates slack time, $\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global
fine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler
outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a
wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon
constraints.

Abstract: Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is
inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a framework that
integrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with
visualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters.
PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and
elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer
mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of
the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional
design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.
Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the
learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives
into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding
of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and
linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge
discovery.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,
especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.

Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces
a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these
limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the
outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower
computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision
Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the
contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on
forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast
that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method,
achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a
2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well
as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally

TL;DR: 这篇范围综述分析了机器学习在电力系统保护和扰动管理中的应用，发现虽然ML模型在模拟数据上表现良好，但缺乏真实世界验证和标准化评估，提出了改进研究可重复性和实用性的指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可再生能源和分布式能源的集成对传统电力系统保护方案构成挑战，需要评估机器学习在保护任务中的应用范围和效果，以应对不断变化的电网条件。

Method: 采用PRISMA范围综述框架，基于100多篇文献进行系统分析，建立了面向机器学习的保护任务分类法，解决了术语不一致问题，并提出了标准化报告实践指南。

Result: ML模型在模拟数据集上通常表现出高准确性，但在真实条件下的性能验证不足。现有文献存在方法严谨性、数据集质量和评估指标不一致的问题，缺乏标准化阻碍了结果的可比性。

Conclusion: 需要优先开发公共基准数据集、现实验证方法和先进ML架构，以推动基于机器学习的保护从理论承诺走向在动态分散电力系统中的实际部署。

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

TL;DR: 提出Rashomon Ensemble方法，通过从性能相似但解释不同的多个模型中选择多样性模型构建集成，提高泛化能力，在真实数据集上实现显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习中模型选择泛化能力不足的问题，利用Rashomon效应（多个模型性能相似但解释不同）来构建更鲁棒的集成模型

Method: 基于模型性能和解释对高性能模型进行分组，选择覆盖解空间不同区域的模型构建集成，最大化多样性同时保持预测准确性

Result: 在开放和专有真实数据集上验证，在Rashomon比例较大的场景中AUROC提升超过0.20，在多个实际应用中展现显著业务价值

Conclusion: Rashomon Ensemble方法通过利用模型多样性有效提高泛化性能，对分布偏移和未见数据变化具有更好的鲁棒性，在实际应用中具有重要价值

Abstract: Creating models from past observations and ensuring their effectiveness on
new data is the essence of machine learning. However, selecting models that
generalize well remains a challenging task. Related to this topic, the Rashomon
Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given
learning problem. This often occurs in real-world scenarios, like the
manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead
to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a
method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing
solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their
performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity
while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model
covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust
to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach
on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating
up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large.
Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various
real-world applications, highlighting the robustness, practicality, and
effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 该研究为深度线性网络的学习过程提供了几何和热力学框架，群作用和黎曼淹没是分析过参数化网络的有效工具。

Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a
foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main
tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use
of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of
observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by
group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show
that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is
obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical
step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.

TL;DR: Sensitivity-LoRA是一种高效的LLM微调方法，通过基于权重矩阵的全局和局部敏感度动态分配秩，解决了传统LoRA方法统一秩分配的限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法对所有增量矩阵使用统一的秩分配，现有秩分配技术计算效率低、复杂且不稳定，阻碍了实际应用。需要一种更高效、稳定的秩分配方法。

Method: 利用损失函数的二阶导数（Hessian矩阵）有效捕捉权重敏感度，基于权重矩阵的全局和局部敏感度动态分配秩，以最小的计算开销实现最优秩分配。

Result: 实验结果表明，Sensitivity-LoRA在不同任务和基准测试中表现出强大的有效性、效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: Sensitivity-LoRA通过动态秩分配解决了LoRA方法的局限性，为资源受限环境下的LLM专业化提供了高效、稳定的微调解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and
scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to
specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to
LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.
However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each
incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing
this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering
practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose
Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates
ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It
leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to
effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with
minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated
robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across
diverse tasks and benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出一个结合多元格兰杰因果和PCMCI+的因果感知深度学习框架，用于北极海冰范围预测，通过因果特征选择提高预测准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习和深度学习模型依赖相关性学习，难以区分真实因果关系和虚假关联，限制了模型的鲁棒性、可解释性和泛化能力

Method: 整合多元格兰杰因果关系(MVGC)和PCMCI+进行因果特征选择，构建混合神经网络架构，使用43年北极海冰范围数据和海洋大气变量

Result: 实验结果表明，引入因果输入在不同预测时间尺度上都能提高预测准确性和可解释性

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于北极海冰预测，还可推广到其他动态高维领域，为因果驱动的预测建模提供了可扩展的方法

Abstract: Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在处理需要高频或非规则时间间隔交互的复杂动态系统时存在困难，连续时间RL在多智能体领域应用受限，主要由于HJB方程的维度灾难和集中式值函数近似困难

Method: 使用物理信息神经网络(PINNs)近似HJB基于值函数，引入值梯度迭代(VGI)模块，通过沿轨迹迭代优化值梯度来确保值与微分结构的一致性

Result: 在连续时间版本的多智能体粒子环境和多智能体MuJoCo基准测试中，该方法持续优于现有连续时间RL基线，并能扩展到复杂多智能体动态系统

Conclusion: 所提出的CT-MARL框架通过结合PINNs和VGI模块，有效解决了连续时间多智能体强化学习中的关键挑战，为复杂动态系统的多智能体控制提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习模型预测ISP对等互联伙伴选择，XGBoost模型在公开数据上达到98%准确率，能够自动化对等伙伴选择过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISP之间的对等互联可以提供更好的网络优化，但传统选择过程复杂耗时，需要自动化解决方案来提高互联网生态系统的效率

Method: 从PeeringDB、CAIDA等公开数据库收集ISP数据，评估基于树、神经网络和Transformer的三类机器学习模型，最终采用XGBoost模型

Result: XGBoost模型在预测对等互联关系方面表现最佳，准确率达到98%，且在时间、空间变化和缺失数据情况下表现出良好的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法可以帮助ISP完全自动化对等伙伴选择过程，推动互联网生态系统向更高效和优化的方向发展

Abstract: Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide
global connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,
ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering
relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering
offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often
involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection
can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of
publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that
can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public
databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we
evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting
peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.
Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and
efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly
available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in
predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great
resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that
ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection
process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet
ecosystem.

TL;DR: HISPASpoof是首个大规模西班牙语合成语音检测数据集，包含真实语音和6种零样本TTS系统生成的合成语音，用于解决西班牙语在语音取证领域的代表性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然英语和中文已有大量合成语音检测器，但全球超过6亿人使用的西班牙语在语音取证领域代表性不足，需要专门的数据集来支持相关研究。

Method: 构建包含真实语音（来自公开语料库，涵盖6种口音）和合成语音（使用6种零样本TTS系统生成）的大规模西班牙语数据集HISPASpoof，并评估5种代表性检测方法在该数据集上的性能。

Result: 研究表明，在英语上训练的检测器无法有效泛化到西班牙语，而在HISPASpoof上训练能显著提升检测性能。同时评估了合成语音溯源（识别生成方法）的性能。

Conclusion: HISPASpoof为推进西班牙语可靠和包容性语音取证提供了关键基准，填补了该语言在合成语音检测领域的空白。

Abstract: Zero-shot Voice Cloning (VC) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) methods have advanced
rapidly, enabling the generation of highly realistic synthetic speech and
raising serious concerns about their misuse. While numerous detectors have been
developed for English and Chinese, Spanish-spoken by over 600 million people
worldwide-remains underrepresented in speech forensics. To address this gap, we
introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for
synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public
corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot
TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors
trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof
substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution
performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic
speech. HISPASpoof thus provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable
and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish.

Result: 方法在广泛SNR条件下显著减少浮点运算量，同时保持竞争力精度，自适应策略能根据信道质量调整合并强度

Conclusion: 为未来边缘智能系统中基于Transformer的语义通信部署提供了可扩展且高效的方法

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

TL;DR: FSPO是一种序列级强化学习方法，通过长度公平的裁剪机制在重要性采样权重空间中直接实施，解决了传统PPO/GRPO方法在序列长度处理上的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列级RL方法在移植PPO/GRPO风格的裁剪时存在长度偏差问题，固定裁剪范围会系统性地对短响应和长响应进行不同权重重分配，扭曲有效目标。

Method: 提出FSPO方法，采用高斯动机的解决方案：用KL校正的漂移项和√L缩放因子对序列对数IS比率进行带裁剪，确保长度公平性。

Result: FSPO在不同长度区间内平滑了裁剪率，稳定了训练过程，并在多个评估数据集上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: FSPO通过理论形式化的长度公平性保证和简单有效的实现方法，为序列级RL提供了更公平和稳定的优化框架。

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

TL;DR: 当前深度学习天气模型的评估指标存在"统计相似性陷阱"，奖励模糊预测但错过罕见高影响事件。本文提出DART框架，通过双解码器架构和物理驱动的过采样等方法，专门针对极端对流检测进行优化，在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有天气模型评估指标存在严重缺陷，会奖励统计上相似但模糊的预测，而无法准确检测罕见但高影响的极端天气事件（如危险对流）。这导致模型在实际应用中可能错过重要的灾害预警。

Method: 提出DART（Dual Architecture for Regression Tasks）框架，采用双解码器架构进行背景/极端事件分解，结合物理驱动的过采样技术和任务特定的损失函数，将粗粒度大气预报转换为高分辨率卫星亮温场。

Result: DART在极端对流检测（低于220K）方面表现优异：CSI达到0.273，偏差为2.52（基准模型在相同CSI下偏差为6.72）；去除集成水汽输送（IVT）使检测性能提升270%；训练时间短于10分钟，可与现有气象工作流无缝集成。

Conclusion: DART框架成功解决了混合转换-分割-降尺度任务，首次系统性地应对了统计相似性陷阱，为极端天气预警提供了可信的AI解决方案，具有实际部署的可行性。

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束强化学习需要在最大化回报的同时满足安全约束，但在连续控制环境中，策略优化方法在约束边界附近表现不稳定，导致训练性能不佳

Method: 引入自适应激励机制，在接近约束边界前保持约束范围内；提出IP3O算法，实施渐进增加的惩罚来稳定训练动态

Result: 在基准环境上的实证评估显示，IP3O相比最先进的安全RL算法表现出更好的性能

Conclusion: IP3O算法有效解决了约束强化学习的训练稳定性问题，并提供了理论最优性误差边界保证

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while
adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific
safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents
govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and
constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization
methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in
suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the
reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the
constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally
Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that
enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics.
Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the
efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL
algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound
on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vejde框架结合数据抽象、图神经网络和强化学习，为具有丰富结构状态的决策问题生成归纳策略函数，在未见过的测试实例上表现出良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具有丰富结构化状态（如对象类和关系）的决策问题，传统方法难以处理变化大小和结构的问题，需要能够归纳泛化的策略函数。

Method: 将MDP状态表示为实体事实数据库，转换为二分图，通过神经消息传递映射到潜在状态。使用监督学习和强化学习训练策略，处理不同大小和结构的问题。

Result: 在8个RDDL问题域的测试中，Vejde策略在未见实例上平均泛化良好，得分接近针对特定实例训练的MLP代理。

Conclusion: Vejde框架能够有效处理结构化状态决策问题，实现良好的跨实例泛化性能，为复杂决策问题提供了有效的归纳策略学习方法。

Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction,
graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances
that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问答模拟器方法存在性能与效率的权衡：LLM-free方法推理快但性能次优，LLM-based方法效果好但推理慢且资源消耗大。需要一种既能保持高效推理又能提升性能的方法

Method: 提出LLM蒸馏模拟器(LDSim)，从大型语言模型蒸馏领域知识和推理能力来辅助预测，改进模拟性能

Result: 大量实验表明LDSim在模拟任务和知识追踪任务上都取得了强劲的结果

Conclusion: LDSim方法通过知识蒸馏有效平衡了性能与效率，为教育推荐系统提供了高质量的模拟数据生成方案

Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student
learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to
questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to
collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,
thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from
undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two
categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:
(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer
the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based
on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain
knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free
methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In
contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of
slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we
propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills
domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist
prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task
and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 解决实际工业应用中旋转机械故障诊断面临的两个主要挑战：获取足够标注数据困难且成本高，以及不同设备需要单独训练模型缺乏泛化能力

Method: 集成时频域编码器和元学习泛化模型，使用时频域随机增强生成状态表示，通过元学习网络进行分类和泛化训练，最后用少量标注数据微调

Result: 在轴承故障数据集和转子试验台数据上验证，仅使用1%标注样本数据就达到99%的故障诊断准确率，表现出强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: MMT-FD框架能够有效解决旋转机械故障诊断中的少样本和无监督学习问题，具有高效率和强泛化能力，适用于各种机械设备的故障诊断

Abstract: The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: EMPG通过解耦策略梯度幅度与熵的关系，有效解决了LLM智能体在稀疏奖励环境中的学习效率问题，为长时程任务提供了稳定高效的学习框架。

Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it
difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

Conclusion: DRSALife框架是有效的软人工生命规则集学习方法，能够在无先验知识情况下准确表征反应扩散系统的涌现动力学，对噪声和稀疏数据具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity,
particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are
widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,
epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.
A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification
when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to
address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,
such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for
reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the
applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft
Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately
represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.
This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game
of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is
one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning
and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior
knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive
findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy
and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we
successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics
with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to
Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

Motivation: 传统GNN依赖局部消息传递，难以捕捉复杂高阶子图模式，现有基于随机游走的方法主要针对图级任务且配置固定，限制了在节点分类等下游任务的应用和灵活性。

Method: 提出Mixture of Subgraph Experts (MoSE)框架，使用匿名游走提取信息子图，根据结构语义动态路由到专门专家网络，能够灵活捕捉多样子图模式。

Conclusion: MoSE提供了一个灵活且表达力强的子图表示学习框架，在多种图任务中表现出色，同时提供了模型学习结构模式的可解释性洞察。

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning
from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing
restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns.
leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have
attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk
kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for
graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks
such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder
the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts
(MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation
learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative
subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized
experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse
subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further
provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph
Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.
Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph
experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but
also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the
model.

Motivation: HGR相关系数能够捕捉非线性相关性，在算法公平性、科学分析和因果发现中有重要应用价值。但现有可微分估计算法存在偏差-方差权衡问题，影响方法鲁棒性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用用户可配置的多项式核来计算HGR相关系数，提供了更快的计算速度和几乎同等有效的约束条件，增强了方法的稳健性。

Conclusion: 提出的多项式核方法为HGR相关系数的计算提供了更可靠和实用的解决方案，特别适合现实世界应用场景中的约束机器学习任务。

Abstract: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) correlation coefficient is an extension
of Pearson's correlation that is not limited to linear correlations, with
potential applications in algorithmic fairness, scientific analysis, and causal
discovery. Recently, novel algorithms to estimate HGR in a differentiable
manner have been proposed to facilitate its use as a loss regularizer in
constrained machine learning applications. However, the inherent
uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly
compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical
concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational
approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering
greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet
almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant
advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable
option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental
analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained
machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful
subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer.

Motivation: 深度学习中的模型和超参数选择需要大量专业知识和计算资源，现有LLM方法依赖试错和昂贵API，缺乏可解释性和泛化性。

Method: 利用历史实验结果的SHAP解释，结合元学习和LLM推理进行超参数推荐，采用LLM-as-judge评估控制输出质量。

Result: 在8个医学影像数据集上，MetaLLMiX性能优于传统HPO方法，计算成本大幅降低，响应时间减少99.6-99.9%，在5/8任务上达到最优结果，训练速度提升2.4-15.7倍。

Conclusion: MetaLLMiX提供了一种高效、可解释的超参数优化解决方案，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了竞争性的性能表现。

Abstract: Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in
deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While
AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based
approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited
interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot
hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI,
and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with
SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained
models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation
to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that
MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO
methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment
outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8
tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times
on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM生成的自我反事实解释(SCEs)存在有效性-最小性权衡问题，要么修改过多缺乏洞察力，要么修改过少无法改变预测结果，表明SCEs作为可解释性工具效果有限甚至可能误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了让人工智能与人类有效协作，语言模型需要能够用自然语言解释其决策过程，研究特定类型的自我解释方法——自我生成反事实解释(SCEs)。

Method: 评估LLM生成的反事实解释是否有效(达到预期结果)和最小化(仅做必要修改)，在多个LLM、数据集和评估设置中进行测试。

Result: LLM通常能生成有效的SCEs但远非最小化，当要求生成最小反事实时又往往修改过小无法改变预测，存在明显的有效性-最小性权衡问题。

Conclusion: SCEs作为可解释性工具效果有限甚至可能产生误导，在高风险场景部署LLM时必须考虑不可靠自我解释对下游决策的影响。

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to
explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of
self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a
model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have
predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that
are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no
more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs
typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little
insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to
generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits
that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is
consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings
suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at
worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to
deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable
self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 机器学习和地统计学在土壤属性预测中各有优势但方法不同，需要一种能够结合两者优势的混合框架来提高预测精度和空间映射能力

Method: KpR（Kriging prior regression）方法，通过普通克里金法构建空间滞后特征来丰富机器学习模型的空间上下文，使用TabPFN模型在六个田间尺度数据集上进行评估

Result: KpR与TabPFN组合相比其他空间技术和非空间机器学习算法，提供了更可靠的不确定性估计和更准确的预测，平均R2比无空间上下文的机器学习算法提高约30%

Conclusion: KpR与TabPFN是一个强大且多功能的建模框架，特别适用于样本量较小的精准农业中的数字土壤制图任务

Abstract: Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks
for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages
the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the
relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We
propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through
engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this
approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of
regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and
probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six
fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,
clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and
in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable
uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several
other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as
well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random
forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%
compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This
improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN
algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR
features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small
sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for
weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal
soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a
very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in
precision agriculture.

<details>

Motivation: 传统微生物共现网络推断算法通常只分析单一环境中的静态关联，无法捕捉微生物群落在不同生态条件下的动态适应过程，需要开发能够处理跨环境动态关联的新方法。

Method: 提出了Same-All Cross-validation (SAC)验证框架来评估算法性能，并开发了fuser算法，该算法在训练时保留特定子样本信号的同时跨环境共享相关信息，生成环境特异性的预测网络。

Result: fuser算法在同质环境(Same)中与glmnet等现有算法性能相当，在跨环境(All)场景中显著降低了测试误差。

Conclusion: fuser算法能够有效捕捉微生物群落在不同环境中的动态关联模式，为微生物生态学研究提供了更准确的跨环境网络推断工具。

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our
understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically
analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single
environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic
microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from
different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial
communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological
conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating
both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed
publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time
points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations
using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates
algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same
environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from
multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of
conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not
entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network
inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing
relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard
approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser
generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results
demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing
algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments
(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in
cross-environment (All) scenarios.

Abstract: Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug
discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints.
While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation
quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due
to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise
fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph
Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete
graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of
conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based
techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over
arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration
(PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test
mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in
controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and
distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of
score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for
flexible, multi-property molecular design.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of forecasting urban water dynamics by
developing a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model that incorporates
both endogenous variables (e.g., water height or discharge) and exogenous
factors (e.g., precipitation history and forecast reports). Unlike conventional
forecasting, the proposed model, AquaCast, captures both inter-variable and
temporal dependencies across all inputs, while focusing forecast solely on
endogenous variables. Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer,
eliminating the need to forecast them and enabling the model to attend to their
short-term influences more effectively. We evaluate our approach on the
LausanneCity dataset, which includes measurements from four urban drainage
sensors, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when using only
endogenous variables. Performance also improves with the inclusion of exogenous
variables and forecast reports. To assess generalization and scalability, we
additionally test the model on three large-scale synthesized datasets,
generated from MeteoSwiss records, the Lorenz Attractors model, and the Random
Fields model, each representing a different level of temporal complexity across
100 nodes. The results confirm that our model consistently outperforms existing
baselines and maintains a robust and accurate forecast across both real and
synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Given-data methods for variance-based sensitivity analysis have significantly
advanced the feasibility of Sobol' index computation for computationally
expensive models and models with many inputs. However, the limitations of
existing methods still preclude their application to models with an extremely
large number of inputs. In this work, we present practical extensions to the
existing given-data Sobol' index method, which allow variance-based sensitivity
analysis to be efficiently performed on large models such as neural networks,
which have $>10^4$ parameterizable inputs. For models of this size, holding all
input-output evaluations simultaneously in memory -- as required by existing
methods -- can quickly become impractical. These extensions also support
nonstandard input distributions with many repeated values, which are not
amenable to equiprobable partitions employed by existing given-data methods.
  Our extensions include a general definition of the given-data Sobol' index
estimator with arbitrary partition, a streaming algorithm to process
input-output samples in batches, and a heuristic to filter out small indices
that are indistinguishable from zero indices due to statistical noise. We show
that the equiprobable partition employed in existing given-data methods can
introduce significant bias into Sobol' index estimates even at large sample
sizes and provide numerical analyses that demonstrate why this can occur. We
also show that our streaming algorithm can achieve comparable accuracy and
runtimes with lower memory requirements, relative to current methods which
process all samples at once. We demonstrate our novel developments on two
application problems in neural network modeling.

Abstract: Many optimization problems in robotics involve the optimization of
time-expensive black-box functions, such as those involving complex simulations
or evaluation of real-world experiments. Furthermore, these functions are often
stochastic as repeated experiments are subject to unmeasurable disturbances.
Bayesian optimization can be used to optimize such methods in an efficient
manner by deploying a probabilistic function estimator to estimate with a given
confidence so that regions of the search space can be pruned away.
Consequently, the success of the Bayesian optimization depends on the function
estimator's ability to provide informative confidence bounds. Existing function
estimators require many function evaluations to infer the underlying confidence
or depend on modeling of the disturbances. In this paper, it is shown that the
confidence bounds provided by the Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimator
(WS-KDE) are applicable as excellent bounds to any stochastic function with an
output confined to the closed interval [0;1] regardless of the distribution of
the output. This finding opens up the use of WS-KDE for stable global
optimization on a wider range of cost functions. The properties of WS-KDE in
the context of Bayesian optimization are demonstrated in simulation and applied
to the problem of automated trap design for vibrational part feeders.

Abstract: Low-degree polynomials have emerged as a powerful paradigm for providing
evidence of statistical-computational gaps across a variety of high-dimensional
statistical models [Wein25]. For detection problems -- where the goal is to
test a planted distribution $\mathbb{P}'$ against a null distribution
$\mathbb{P}$ with independent components -- the standard approach is to bound
the advantage using an $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthonormal family of
polynomials. However, this method breaks down for estimation tasks or more
complex testing problems where $\mathbb{P}$ has some planted structures, so
that no simple $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthogonal polynomial family is
available. To address this challenge, several technical workarounds have been
proposed [SW22,SW25], though their implementation can be delicate. In this
work, we propose a more direct proof strategy. Focusing on random graph models,
we construct a basis of polynomials that is almost orthonormal under
$\mathbb{P}$, in precisely those regimes where statistical-computational gaps
arise. This almost orthonormal basis not only yields a direct route to
establishing low-degree lower bounds, but also allows us to explicitly identify
the polynomials that optimize the low-degree criterion. This, in turn, provides
insights into the design of optimal polynomial-time algorithms. We illustrate
the effectiveness of our approach by recovering known low-degree lower bounds,
and establishing new ones for problems such as hidden subcliques, stochastic
block models, and seriation models.
