This work introduces an innovative refinement to these methods\nfor classification tasks, specifically tailored for scenarios where multiple\nobservations (multi-inputs) of a single instance are available at prediction\ntime. Our approach is particularly motivated by applications in citizen\nscience, where multiple images of the same plant or animal are captured by\nindividuals. Our method integrates the information from each observation into\nconformal prediction, enabling a reduction in the size of the predicted label\nset while preserving the required class-conditional coverage guarantee. The\napproach is based on the aggregation of conformal p-values computed from each\nobservation of a multi-input. By exploiting the exact distribution of these\np-values, we propose a general aggregation framework using an abstract scoring\nfunction, encompassing many classical statistical tools. Knowledge of this\ndistribution also enables refined versions of standard strategies, such as\nmajority voting.

In this paper, we explore reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface (RIS)-assisted ISAC systems for IIoT in the coexistence of near-field\nand far-field regions. The system consists of a full-duplex access point (AP),\na RIS and multiple IIoT devices, where the near-field devices simultaneously\nperform sensing and communication, while the far-field devices rely on a\nRIS-assisted communication. To enhance spectral efficiency for both sensing and\ncommunication functionalities, we consider the use of both traditional\nsensing-only (SO) and ISAC frequency bands. Moreover, uplink non-orthogonal\nmultiple access (NOMA) is employed to facilitate the sequential decoding of\nsuperimposed communication and sensing signals from IIoT devices.
