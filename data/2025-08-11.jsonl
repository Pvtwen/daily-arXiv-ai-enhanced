In this case, the FI often tends to be\ndistributed among all features which are in correlation with the\nresponse-generating signal features. Even worse, if multiple signal features\nare in strong correlation with a noise feature, while being only modestly\ncorrelated with one another, this can result in a noise feature having a\ndistinctly larger FI score than any signal feature. Here we propose local\nsample weighting (losaw) which can flexibly be integrated into many ML\nalgorithms to improve FI scores in the presence of feature correlation in the\ntraining data. Our approach is motivated from inverse probability weighting in\ncausal inference and locally, within the ML model, uses a sample weighting\nscheme to decorrelate a target feature from the remaining features. This\nreduces model bias locally, whenever the effect of a potential signal feature\nis evaluated and compared to others. Moreover, losaw comes with a natural\ntuning parameter, the minimum effective sample size of the weighted population,\nwhich corresponds to an interpretation-prediction-tradeoff, analog to a\nbias-variance-tradeoff as for classical ML tuning parameters. We demonstrate\nhow losaw can be integrated within decision tree-based ML methods and within\nmini-batch training of neural networks. We investigate losaw for random forest\nand convolutional neural networks in a simulation study on settings showing\ndiverse correlation patterns.

Clinical\ninformation that informs prognostication is collected serially over time.\nShortly after cardiac arrest, various time-invariant baseline features are\ncollected (e.g., demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics). After ICU\nadmission, additional features are gathered, including time-varying hemodynamic\ndata (e.g., blood pressure, doses of vasopressor medications). We view these as\ntwo phases in which we collect new features. In this study, we propose a novel\nstepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of\nneurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of\ntime-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase).\nNotably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying\nhemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this\ninformation is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient\nover time, how important these data are for prognostication varies). Our\napproach extends the standard Fine and Gray model to explicitly model the two\nphases and to incorporate neural networks to flexibly capture complex nonlinear\nfeature relationships. Evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 2,278 comatose\npost-arrest patients, our model demonstrates robust discriminative performance\nfor the competing outcomes of awakening, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy,\nand death despite maximal support. Our approach generalizes to more than two\nphases in which new features are collected and could be used in other dynamic\nprediction tasks, where it may be helpful to know when and for whom newly\ncollected features significantly improve prediction."}

Such ignorance leads to their\nperformance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in\nmodeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and\nmeta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of\nsemantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive\nHeterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN\nemploys a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily\ndistributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages\nfrom diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which\nfilters out noise and emphasizes informative signals.

A key algorithmic tool in neuromorphic\ncomputing is spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs are biologically inspired\nneural networks which utilize stateful neurons, and provide low-bit data\nprocessing by encoding and decoding information using spikes. Similar to SNNs,\ndeep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks. However, deep\nSSMs, which recently achieved competitive performance in various temporal\nmodeling tasks, are typically designed with high-precision activation functions\nand no reset mechanisms. To bridge the gains offered by SNNs and the recent\ndeep SSM models, we propose a novel multiple-output spiking neuron model that\ncombines a linear, general SSM state transition with a non-linear feedback\nmechanism through reset. Compared to the existing neuron models for SNNs, our\nproposed model clearly conceptualizes the differences between the spiking\nfunction, the reset condition and the reset action. The experimental results on\nvarious tasks, i.e., a keyword spotting task, an event-based vision task and a\nsequential pattern recognition task, show that our proposed model achieves\nperformance comparable to existing benchmarks in the SNN literature. Our\nresults illustrate how the proposed reset mechanism can overcome instability\nand enable learning even when the linear part of neuron dynamics is unstable,\nallowing us to go beyond the strictly enforced stability of linear dynamics in\nrecent deep SSM models."}
